{"ID": 1614, "text": "Pitt, no mighty minister, and\nhence it is that our country, which under the rule of a Cromwell or a Pitt, hath risen to be\nthe arbiter of Europe, and held all nations in awe, is now sunk, under the sway of feeble intellects,\nto a precarious position, the mock of every power, and saved only by her fleets from absolute\ndestruction.\n\nI do not find it easy to describe my sensations when I was ushered into the presence of the\nGreat Commoner, and saw before me that majestic figure, with the profile of a Roman conqueror,\nand a glance hardly less terrible to encounter than the full blaze of the sun. When I have\nstood before the Nabob of Bengal, throned in the midst of his Court, I have seen in front of\nme nothing but a peevish, debauched young man, but when I came into the room where Mr. Pitt\nwas I felt that I was in the presence of a ruler of men. His attitude, his commanding gestures,\nand the stately manner he had of slowly moving his head round upon his neck to look at you,\nmade a most tremendous impression; and I found it easy to believe the stories of men having\nrisen to speak against him in the House of Commons, and then shrunk back miserably into their\nseats at a mere look from this extraordinary person.\n\nMr. Pitt's manner of reading Colonel Clive's despatch further impressed me. He broke the seals,\nseemed to do no more than give it a few devouring glances, and then laid it aside as though\nhe were already master of its contents.\n\n\"You are Ensign Ford?\" he demanded abruptly, fixing his eye upon me.\n\n\"I am, sir.\"\n\n\"Colonel Clive tells me in this letter that you possess his confidence. Do you think, if I\nwere to tell you my sentiments verbally, you could transmit them faithfully to your employer?\"\n\n\"I will do my best, sir,\" I replied, not a little astonished at this proposal. But I have considered\nthe matter since, and I can see that there were many things which Mr. Pitt might not wish to\nwrite with his own hand, though he had no objection to their being repeated by me.\n\n\"In this letter,\" he proceeded, \"Colonel Clive makes a very startling proposal, which is no\nless than that English troops should be sent out sufficient to conquer the whole of Bengal,\nand that thereafter the administration of all the Indian territories should be taken out of\nthe hands of the Company and brought immediately under the Crown. Now what I wish you to tell\nhim from me in reply is this, that I am bound to consider his proposal not merely as it affects\nour situation abroad, but also as it bears upon our government at home. I am the minister,\nnot of a despotic empire like France or Spain, but of a free people, and I must not suffer\nanything which may assist the Crown to encroach upon our liberties."}

She used to come home laden with little bundles; and before\nsupper she would change her street clothes for a neat, washable\nhousedress, as is our thrifty custom.

The\nminister's wife did not call.\n\nShe rose early, like the rest of us; and as summer came on we used to\nsee her moving about in her little garden patch in the dewy, golden\nmorning. She wore absurd pale-blue negligees that made her stout figure\nloom immense against the greenery of garden and apple tree.  The\nneighborhood women viewed these negligees with Puritan disapproval as\nthey smoothed down their own prim, starched gingham skirts.

The sarcophagus separated\nin two parts, lengthwise, and the lower part sank down and disclosed a coffin of rock crystal\nas clear as the atmosphere.  Within lay the body, robed in costly habiliments covered with\ngold embroidery and starred with scintillating gems.

Why Miss\nStanton, he riz right up in bed at the last, and clear and strong he\njest yelled it:  'Hurrah fur Grant!'\"\n\nMy mother's fingers tightened in my hair until I thought she would pull\nout a lot, and I could feel her knees stiffen.  Leon just whooped.\nMother sprang up and ran to the door.\n\n\"Leon!\" she cried.  Then there was a slam.  \"What in the world is the\nmatter?\" she asked.\n\n\"Stepped out of the tub right on the soap, and it threw me down,\"\nexplained Leon.\n\n\"For mercy sake, be careful!\" said my mother, and shut the door.\n\nIt wasn't a minute before the knob turned and it opened again a little.\n\nI never saw mother's face look so queer, but at last she said softly:\n\"You were thinking of the grave cover for him?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I wanted to ask you before I bound myself.  I heard you lost\ntwo when the scarlet fever was ragin' an' I'm goin' to do jest what you\ndo.  If you have kivers, I will.  If you don't like them when you see\nhow bright and shiny they are, I won't get any either.\"\n\n\"I can tell you without seeing them, Mrs. Freshett,\" said my mother,\nwrapping a strand of hair around the tin so tight I slipped up my\nfingers to feel whether my neck wasn't like a buck-eye hull looks, and\nit was.  \"I don't want any cover for the graves of my dead but grass\nand flowers, and sky and clouds.  I like the rain to fall on them, and\nthe sun to shine, so that the grass and flowers will grow.  If you are\nsatisfied that the soul of Henry is safe in Heaven, that is all that is\nnecessary.  Laying a slab of iron on top of earth six feet above his\nbody will make no difference to him.  If he is singing with the angels,\nby all means save your money for the organ.\"\n\n\"I don't know about the singin', but I'd stake my last red cent he's\nstill hollerin' fur Grant.  I was kind o' took with the idea; the\nthings was so shiny and scilloped at the edges, peered like it was\npayin' considerable respect to the dead to kiver them that-a-way.\"\n\n\"What good would it do?\" asked mother.  \"The sun shining on the iron\nwould make it so hot it would burn any flower you tried to plant in the\nopening; the water couldn't reach the roots, and all that fell on the\nslab would run off and make it that much wetter at the edges.  The iron\nwould soon rust and grow dreadfully ugly lying under winter snow.\nThere is nothing at all in it, save a method to work on the feelings of\nthe living, and get them to pay their money for something that wouldn't\naffect their dead a particle.\"\n\n\"'Twould be a poor idea for me,\" said Mrs. Freshett.  \"I said to the\nmen that I wanted to honour Henry all I could, but with my bulk, I'd\nhev all I could do, come Jedgment Day, to bust my box, an' heave up the\nclods, without havin' to hist up a piece of iron an' klim from under\nit.\"\n\nMother stiffened and Leon slipped again.  He could have more accidents\nthan any boy I ever knew.  But it was only a few minutes until he came\nto mother and gave her a Bible to mark the verses he had to learn to\nrecite at Sunday-school next day.  Mother couldn't take the time when\nshe had company, so she asked if he weren't big enough to pick out ten\nproper verses and learn them by himself, and he said of course he was.\nHe took his Bible and he and May and I sat on the back steps and\nstudied our verses.  He and May were so big they had ten; but I had\nonly two, and mine were not very long.  Leon giggled half the time he\nwas studying.  I haven't found anything so very funny in the Bible.\nEvery few minutes he would whisper to himself:  \"THAT'S A GOOD ONE!\"\n\nHe took the book and heard May do hers until she had them perfectly,\nthen he went and sat on the back fence with his book and studied as I\nnever before had seen him.  Mrs. Freshett stayed so long mother had no\ntime to hear him, but he told her he had them all learned so he could\nrepeat them without a mistake.\n\nNext morning mother was busy, so she had no time then.  Father,\nShelley, and I rode on the front seat, mother, May, and Sally on the\nback, while the boys started early and walked.\n\nWhen we reached the top of the hill, the road was lined with carriages,\nwagons, spring wagons, and saddle horses.  Father found a place for our\nteam and we went down the walk between the hitching rack and the\ncemetery fence.  Mother opened the gate and knelt beside two small\ngraves covered with grass, shaded by yellow rose bushes, and marked\nwith little white stones.  She laid some flowers on each and wiped the\ndust from the carved letters with her handkerchief.  The little sisters\nwho had scarlet fever and whooping cough lay there.  Mother was still a\nminute and then she said softly:  \"'The Lord has given and the Lord has\ntaken away.  Blessed be the name of the Lord.'\"\n\nShe was very pale when she came to us, but her eyes were bright and she\nsmiled as she put her arms around as many of us as she could reach.\n\n\"What a beautiful horse!\" said Sally.  \"Look at that saddle and bridle!\nThe Pryor girl is here.\"\n\n\"Why should she come?\" asked Shelley.\n\n\"To show her fine clothes and queen it over us!\"\n\n\"Children, children!\" said mother.  \"'Judge not!'  This is a house of\nworship.  The Lord may be drawing her in His own way.  It is for us to\nhelp Him by being kind and making her welcome.\"\n\nAt the church door we parted and sat with our teachers, but for the\nfirst time as I went down the aisle I was not thinking of my linen\ndress, my patent leather slippers, and my pretty curls.  It suddenly\nseemed cheap to me to twist my hair when it was straight as a shingle,\nand cut my head on tin.  If the Lord had wanted me to have curls, my\nhair would have been like Sally's.  Seemed to me hers tried to see into\nwhat big soft curls it could roll.  May said ours was so straight it\nbent back the other way.  Anyway, I made up my mind to talk it over\nwith father and always wear braids after that, if I could get him to\ncoax mother to let me.\n\nOur church was quite new and it was beautiful.  All the casings were\noiled wood, and the walls had just a little yellow in the last skin\ncoating used to make them smooth, so they were a creamy colour, and the\nblinds were yellow.  The windows were wide open and the wind drifted\nthrough, while the birds sang as much as they ever do in August, among\nthe trees and bushes of the cemetery.  Every one had planted so many\nflowers of all kinds on the graves you could scent sweet odours.  Often\na big, black-striped, brown butterfly came sailing in through one of\nthe windows, followed the draft across the room, and out of another.  I\nwas thinking something funny: it was about what the Princess had said\nof other people, and whether hers were worse.  I looked at my father\nsitting in calm dignity in his Sunday suit and thought him quite as\nfine and handsome as mother did.  Every Sabbath he wore the same suit,\nhe sat in the same spot, he worshipped the Lord in his calm, earnest\nway.  The ministers changed, but father was as much a part of the\nservice as the Bible on the desk or the communion table.  I wondered if\npeople said things about him, and if they did, what they were.  I never\nhad heard.  Twisting in my seat, one by one I studied the faces on the\nmen's side, and then the women.  It was a mighty good-looking crowd.\nSome had finer clothes than others--that is always the way--but as a\nrule every one was clean, neat, and good to see.  From some you\nscarcely could turn away.  There was Widow Fall.  She was French, from\nVirginia, and she talked like little tinkly notes of music.  I just\nloved to hear her, and she walked like high-up royalty.  Her dress was\nalways black, with white bands at the neck and sleeves, black rustly\nsilk, and her eyes and hair were like the dress.  There was a little\nred on her cheeks and lips, and her face was always grave until she saw\nyou directly before her, and then she smiled the sweetest smile.\n\nMaybe Sarah Hood was not pretty, but there was something about her lean\nface and shining eyes that made you look twice before you were sure of\nit, and by that time you had got so used to her, you liked her better\nas she was, and wouldn't have changed her for anything.  Mrs. Fritz had\na pretty face and dresses and manners, and so did Hannah Dover, only\nshe talked too much.  So I studied them and remembered what the\nPrincess had said, and I wondered if she heard some one say that Peter\nJustice beat his wife, or if she showed it in her face and manner.  She\nreminded me of a scared cowslip that had been cut and laid in the sun\nan hour.  I don't know as that expresses it.  Perhaps a flower couldn't\nlook scared, but it could be wilted and faded.  I wondered if she ever\nhad bright hair, laughing eyes, and red in her lips and cheeks.  She\nmust have been pretty if she had.\n\nAt last I reached my mother.  There was nothing scared or faded about\nher, and she was dreadfully sick too, once in a while since she had the\nfever.  She was a little bit of a woman, coloured like a wild rose\npetal, face and body--a piece of pink porcelain Dutch, father said.\nShe had brown eyes, hair like silk, and she always had three best\ndresses.  There was one of alpaca or woollen, of black, gray or brown,\nand two silks.  Always there was a fine rustly black one with a bonnet\nand mantle to match, and then a softer, finer one of either gold brown,\nlike her hair, or dainty gray, like a dove's wing.  When these grew too\nold for fine use, she wore them to Sunday-school and had a fresh one\nfor best.  There was a new gray in her closet at home, so she put on\nthe old brown to-day, and she was lovely in it.\n\nUsually the minister didn't come for church services until\nSunday-school was half over, so the superintendent read a chapter,\nDaddy Debs prayed, and all of us stood up and sang: \"Ring Out the Joy\nBells.\"  Then the superintendent read the lesson over as impressively\nas he could.  The secretary made his report, we sang another song,\ngathered the pennies, and each teacher took a class and talked over the\nlesson a few minutes.  Then we repeated the verses we had committed to\nmemory to our teachers; the member of each class who had learned the\nnicest texts, and knew them best, was selected to recite before the\nschool.  Beginning with the littlest people, we came to the big folks.\nEach one recited two texts until they reached the class above mine.  We\nwalked to the front, stood inside the altar, made a little bow, and the\nsuperintendent kept score.  I could see that mother appeared worried\nwhen Leon's name was called for his class, for she hadn't heard him,\nand she was afraid he would forget.\n\nAmong the funny things about Leon was this: while you had to drive\nother boys of his age to recite, you almost had to hold him to keep him\nfrom it.  Father said he was born for a politician or a preacher, if he\nwould be good, and grow into the right kind of a man to do such\nresponsible work.\n\n\"I forgot several last Sabbath, so I have thirteen to-day,\" he said\npolitely.\n\nOf course no one expected anything like that.  You never knew what\nmight happen when Leon did anything.  He must have been about sixteen.\nHe was a slender lad, having almost sandy hair, like his English\ngrandfather.  He wore a white ruffled shirt with a broad collar, and\ncuffs turning back over his black jacket, and his trousers fitted his\nslight legs closely.  The wind whipped his soft black tie a little and\nruffled the light hair where it was longest and wavy above his\nforehead.  Such a perfect picture of innocence you never saw.  There\nwas one part of him that couldn't be described any better than the way\nMr. Rienzi told about his brother in his \"Address to the Romans,\" in\nMcGuffey's Sixth.  \"The look of heaven on his face\" stayed most of the\ntime; again, there was a dealish twinkle that sparkled and flashed\nwhile he was thinking up something mischievous to do.  When he was\nfighting angry, and going to thrash Absalom Saunders or die trying, he\nwas plain white and his eyes were like steel.  Mother called him\n\"Weiscope,\" half the time.  I can only spell the way that sounds, but\nit means \"white-head,\" and she always used that name when she loved him\nmost.  \"The look of heaven\" was strong on his face now.\n\n\"One,\" said the recording secretary.\n\n\"Jesus wept,\" answered Leon promptly.\n\nThere was not a sound in the church.  You could almost hear the\nbutterflies pass.  Father looked down and laid his lower lip in folds\nwith his fingers, like he did sometimes when it wouldn't behave to suit\nhim.\n\n\"Two,\" said the secretary after just a breath of pause.\n\nLeon looked over the congregation easily and then fastened his eyes on\nAbram Saunders, the father of Absalom, and said reprovingly:  \"Give not\nsleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids.\"\n\nAbram straightened up suddenly and blinked in astonishment, while\nfather held fast to his lip.\n\n\"Three,\" called the secretary hurriedly.\n\nLeon shifted his gaze to Betsy Alton, who hadn't spoken to her next\ndoor neighbour in five years.\n\n\"Hatred stirreth up strife,\" he told her softly, \"but love covereth all\nsins.\"\n\nThings were so quiet it seemed as if the air would snap.\n\n\"Four.\"\n\nThe mild blue eyes travelled back to the men's side and settled on\nIsaac Thomas, a man too lazy to plow and sow land his father had left\nhim.  They were not so mild, and the voice was touched with command:\n\"Go to the ant, thou sluggard, consider her ways and be wise.\"\n\nStill that silence.\n\n\"Five,\" said the secretary hurriedly, as if he wished it were over.\nBack came the eyes to the women's side and past all question looked\nstraight at Hannah Dover.\n\n\"As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman without\ndiscretion.\"\n\n\"Six,\" said the secretary and looked appealingly at father, whose face\nwas filled with dismay.\n\nAgain Leon's eyes crossed the aisle and he looked directly at the man\nwhom everybody in the community called \"Stiff-necked Johnny.\"\n\nI think he was rather proud of it, he worked so hard to keep them doing\nit.\n\n\"Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck,\" Leon\ncommanded him.\n\nToward the door some one tittered.\n\n\"Seven,\" called the secretary hastily.\n\nLeon glanced around the room.\n\n\"But how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in\nunity,\" he announced in delighted tones as if he had found it out by\nhimself.\n\n\"Eight,\" called the secretary with something like a breath of relief.\n\nOur angel boy never had looked so angelic, and he was beaming on the\nPrincess.\n\n\"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee,\" he told her.\n\nLaddie would thrash him for that.\n\nInstantly after, \"Nine,\" he recited straight at Laddie:  \"I made a\ncovenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?\"\n\nMore than one giggled that time.\n\n\"Ten!\" came almost sharply.\n\nLeon looked scared for the first time.  He actually seemed to shiver.\nMaybe he realized at last that it was a pretty serious thing he was\ndoing.  When he spoke he said these words in the most surprised voice\nyou ever heard:  \"I was almost in all evil in the midst of the\ncongregation and assembly.\"\n\n\"Eleven.\"\n\nPerhaps these words are in the Bible.

{"ID": 153, "text": "Issachar gradually came to realize the potential of a more open-minded sect of Judaism, one that would extend its charitable hand to both Jews and Gentiles alike, and include all of humanity in its vision of heaven. He may have thought of his son, who had recently left to pursue the laws of Moses and the restoration of the Temple. At the end of a sermon that spoke to his heart, Issachar made a generous offering for the support of the minister and the spreading of such a gospel. He descended from the gallery and placed a crucifix on the altar, telling the congregation that if they believed in the message of the sermon, they deserved this precious object. But instead of being received with gratitude, he was mocked and chased out of the meeting. Unfazed, Issachar laughed in scorn and returned to his life on Chincoteague Island. As the years passed, he grew feeble and longed for his son, who was studying with Rabbis in a distant land. A terrible illness struck, and in loneliness and desperation, Issachar resolved to sell the last jewel from the Christian image in order to fund his son's return. A flood swept over the island, and all was lost except for Issachar's cottage on stilts. He refused to abandon it, and was eventually left with nothing but the cross, which glimmered with a kind of divine presence in his dark and empty home.As Christmas approached in the year 1850, a powerful storm raged and wrecks started washing ashore on the submerged shoal of Chincoteague. With no wreckers to salvage them, the situation seemed grim. This was compounded by the fact that the Eli was overdue, and when the familiar sound of a gun was heard at sea, thrice and twice thrice, Issachar realized with anguish that it was his son's schooner, and that his son was in danger.\n\nIn his desperation, Issachar couldn't help but wish for a day's strength, like he had in his youth, to go out and save his son from the tumultuous waves. However, he was now an old man and couldn't even get out of bed. As he searched for help or hope, his eyes fell on the naked cross in the cabin, and with piety, he implored the \"Paschal Lamb\" to die for him that night and let him see his son's face.\n\nAs he gazed at the cross, Issachar fell into a deep stupor or ecstasy that made him unaware of the passage of time. Suddenly, his son Abraham burst into the hut, nearly naked and drenched from fighting for his life in the surf. The water was entering the cracks of the cabin, and the elderly Issachar knew his life was almost over. He gave Abraham his blessing and urged him to continue Israel's legacy, as he was too old to try for life.\n\nAs the cabin pitched like a sailing vessel, and the dense sea fog closed around them, Issachar and Abraham became aware that they were sailing to sea, and it was too late to escape. The next billow could fling them apart, and their bones could descend amongst the oyster shells in the depths of the sea. But they took comfort in the denuded cross that shone brilliantly and reduced all other objects to insignificance. It was the same light that Abraham had seen through the darkness of the billows that saved him.\n\nAs they held each other tightly, they looked at the cross, and Issachar asked Abraham if there was any reason why they couldn't beseech its illumination again before it returned to the ocean with them. The cross seemed to wear a visible countenance, and young Abraham extended his hands to it, finding wondrous consolation of love and rest in its beams. It reconciled them to their helplessness in the presence of the Almighty awe and gave them a glimpse of life immortal.\n\nThe Jew called his son a \"child of God\" and exclaimed that he gave him life only for a span, but he was now bringing life immortal to him.After the storm subsided, the wreckers sought Christmas gifts for their children on the shore. Among the debris, they found parts of the Eli and the tenement of its owner. As they searched, a wave washed up two bodies, a young man with dark, oriental eyes and an old man with a rugged face. The fishermen and idlers laid them together and the star of Christmas twinkled above. Black men and white, indifferent to social prejudices, followed them to the grave.\n\nIn Haunted Point, the fishermen heard phantom carpenters as they hewed the pines to build the pungy boat. They launched it with their own and another vessel, but ghostly sailors joined them. Every day, the pungy boat lay off Haunted Point and eerie voices half-spoke in the fog. The island parson said it was the pirate band, whose gold was lost on Haunted Point and hid with bloody hand. Until a kidnapped boy converted his stealer's soul in the groves of Haunted Point, the fiends would not aroint. They kidnapped the island parson's child and the pungy sank with the pirates' gold.\n\nIn the London Tract \"Hardshell\" Baptist graveyard near Newark, Delaware, there is a tombstone that gives the sound of a ticking watch when one places their ear on it. The church was the worshipping place of settlers who either came from London or chose land owned by a London company. The graveyard has many gravestones of Welsh worshippers, and the Ticking Stone is the oldest portion of the inclosure. The recumbent slab, worn smooth with almost no trace of lettering, makes an audible, tangible ticking when one puts their ear on it.\"No, I swear on my honor, that is not the sound of a scratch you hear. It cannot be any insect or any living movement in the stone or beneath it. Can you compare it to anything other than the consistent ticking of a somewhat weak timepiece?\" I listened again, this time for longer, and a sense of superstition washed over me. If I had been alone, I likely would have felt a sense of lonely trepidation. To stand amidst the silent memorial stones of the early times and hear a watch ticking beneath one of them as clearly as you can feel it in your vest pocket, and then to feel your heart start nervously at the recognition of this disconnected sound, is not satisfying, even in the company of others. \"This is the best ghost I have ever found,\" I said. \"Maybe someone has slipped a watch underneath, for it is certainly somebody's watch; there is something tangible about it.\"\n\n\"I once lifted the stone myself,\" said Pusey, \"and the ticking seemed to come up from the ground. As I deliberated, an old man came out of the nearby sexton's house and warned me not to disturb the dead. He crossed the wall and assisted me in replacing the stone, and then asked me to sit on it, like an ancient mariner, while he divulged the cause of the phenomenon.\"\n\nHere, my companion paused for a moment and we could hear the old trees swaying above us, a very solemn sound indeed. A nut, burr or sycamore ball fell from the old church roof and rattled as it landed, causing us to startle even more. \"It is just as peculiar as the story he told me of the disappearance of the old man. Nobody around here can identify him from my descriptions. He walked toward the old mill down Newark road, and the next time I looked up, he was gone. The people in the house there think I am losing my mind for insisting upon his appearance to me at all.\"\n\n\"Please, my friend, continue with the tale,\" I urged. \"It is good for us to feel solemn on occasion.\"\n\n\"This stone, young man,\" said my Quakerly critic in a hard voice, \"is the London Tract Ticking Stone. It is the oldest preacher and advocate in this graveyard, older than the graves of any known pastors or communicants around it.\"\n\n\"In 1764, the relative solitude of this area was disrupted by a large group of chain bearers, rod men, axe men, commissaries, cooks, baggage carriers, and camp followers. They had arrived on the orders of Lord Baltimore and William Penn to settle a long-standing dispute between two great landowners. They were led by Charles Mason of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, and Jeremiah Dixon, the son of a collier found in a coal pit. For three years, they continued westward, running their stakes over mountains and streams, resembling a gypsy camp, and frightening the Indians with their sorcery. But near this spot, they halted for a long time, in order to establish with accuracy the point of tangency, and the point of intersection of three states \u2013 the circular head of Delaware, the abutting right angle of Maryland, and the tiny panhandle of Pennsylvania.\"\n\n\"The people of this region were few, but they possessed strong, sober, and wild characteristics. The long-standing boundary dispute had made them predatory, and though they were God-fearing people, they would fight with great religious intensity to assert their claim to the land and their specific province's dominion. They paused their squabbles when the surveying battalion entered their broken country and looked on with curiosity at all that pertained to the distinguished foreign mathematicians. Peddlers and preachers called together their motley congregations around their camp of tents and pack mules, and the sound of fiddling and haranguing was accompanied by the fighting of dogs, the coarse tones of religious, business, oratory. It was during the height of the Dissenters era in England, and Methodist, Baptist, and Calvinistic zealots were pushing the boundaries of English-speaking people. They were the wild forerunners of the organized bands of clergy that would soon make our colonies sober-minded and prepared for self-governance.\""}

Margaret looked just as in former times, good and graceful; but she stood a little apart\nwith the traveller friend by her side, and I heard Rose whisper to Susan that the wedding was\nto take place in a fortnight. They were only waiting for Geoffrey to arrive. His ship was daily\nexpected, and they all wished him to be present.\n\nAnd Willy, for whose sake the long journey had been made, how was he? Were all their hopes\nrealized? Edward shook his head when Susan's mother asked that question; but Willy was there\nto answer it himself. He was standing by the window, leaning on a stick, it is true, but yet\nable to stand. As he walked across the room, I saw that he limped slightly, but could move\nabout where he pleased. He still looked thin and pale, but the former expression of suffering\nand distress had disappeared, and his countenance was as cheerful as his manner. I could see\nthat he was very much better, though not in robust health like Edward's. He thanked Susan's\nmother for her kind inquiries, and said that, though he had not become all that his sanguine\nbrother hoped, he had gained health more than enough to satisfy himself; that he was most thankful\nfor his present comfort and independence; and that if he was not quite so strong as other people,\nhe hoped he should at any rate make a good use of the strength that was allowed him.

Every one is justified in thinking his own thoughts when he speaks with moderation\nand supports his peculiar opinions with a certain amount of learning.\n\nIt is not denied, even by those who oppose modern theories respecting the genesis of organisms,\nthat there are, excluding some psychical elements, many and important points of resemblance\nbetween man and animals in the exercise of their consciousness, intelligence, and emotions,\nif indeed they are not identically the same. The comparative psychology of man and animals\nplainly shows that the perceptions, both in their respective organs and in their mode of action,\nact in the same way, especially in the higher animals; and the origin, movements, and associations\nof the imagination and the emotions are likewise identical. Nor will it be disputed that we\nfind in animals implicit memory, judgment, and reasoning, the inductions and deductions from\none special fact to another, the passions, the physiological language of gestures, expressive\nof internal emotions, and even, in the case of gregarious animals, the combined action to effect\ncertain purposes; so that, as far as their higher orders are concerned, animals may be regarded\nas a simple and undeveloped form of man, while man, by his later psychical and organic evolution,\nhas become a developed and complex animal.[4]\n\nIn my book on the fundamental law of intelligence in the animal kingdom, I attempted to show\nthis great truth, and to formulate a principle common to all animals in the exercise of their\npsychical emotions, by setting forth the essential elements as they are generally displayed.\nI think I was not far from the truth in establishing a law which seems indubitable; although,\nwhile some men whose opinion is worthy of esteem have accepted it, other very competent judges\nhave objected to some parts of my theory, but without convincing me of error. I repeat my conclusions\nhere, since they are necessary to the theory of the genesis of myth, which I propose to explain\nin this work. I hold the complete identity between man and animals to be established by the\nadequate consideration of the faculties, the psychical elements of consciousness and intelligence,\nand the mode of their spontaneous exercise; and I believe the superiority of man to consist\nnot so much in new faculties as in the reflex effect upon themselves of those he possesses\nin common with the animals. The old adage confirms this theory: _Homo duplex_.\n\nNo one now doubts that animals feel, hear, remember, and the like, while man is able to exercise\nhis will, to feel, to remember, deliberately to consider all his actions and functions, because\nhe not only possesses the direct and spontaneous intuition with respect to himself and things\nin general which he has in common with animals, but he has an intuitive knowledge of that intuition\nitself, and in this way he multiplies within himself the exercise of his whole psychical life."}

You can be good in the Broad Walk all the time, but not at the Round Pond, and the\nreason is that you forget, and, when you remember, you are so wet that you may as well be wetter.\nThere are men who sail boats on the Round Pond, such big boats that they bring them in barrows,\nand sometimes in perambulators, and then the baby has to walk.  The bow-legged children in\nthe Gardens are those who had to walk too soon because their father needed the perambulator.\n\nYou always want to have a yacht to sail on the Round Pond, and in the end your uncle gives\nyou one; and to carry it to the pond the first day is splendid, also to talk about it to boys\nwho have no uncle is splendid, but soon you like to leave it at home.  For the sweetest craft\nthat slips her moorings in the Round Pond is what is called a stick-boat, because she is rather\nlike a stick until she is in the water and you are holding the string.  Then as you walk round,\npulling her, you see little men running about her deck, and sails rise magically and catch\nthe breeze, and you put in on dirty nights at snug harbours which are unknown to the lordly\nyachts.  Night passes in a twink, and again your rakish craft noses for the wind, whales spout,\nyou glide over buried cities, and have brushes with pirates, and cast anchor on coral isles.\nYou are a solitary boy while all this is taking place, for two boys together cannot adventure\nfar upon the Round Pond, and though you may talk to yourself throughout the voyage, giving\norders and executing them with despatch, you know not, when it is time to go home, where you\nhave been or what swelled your sails; your treasure-trove is all locked away in your hold,\nso to speak, which will be opened, perhaps, by another little boy many years afterwards.\n\nBut those yachts have nothing in their hold.  Does any one return to this haunt of his youth\nbecause of the yachts that used to sail it?  Oh no.  It is the stick-boat that is freighted\nwith memories.  The yachts are toys, their owner a fresh-water mariner; they can cross and\nrecross a pond only while the stick-boat goes to sea.  You yachtsmen with your wands, who think\nwe are all there to gaze on you, your ships are only accidents of this place, and were they\nall to be boarded and sunk by the ducks, the real business of the Round Pond would be carried\non as usual.\n\nPaths from everywhere crowd like children to the pond.  Some of them are ordinary paths, which\nhave a rail on each side, and are made by men with their coats off, but others are vagrants,\nwide at one spot, and at another so narrow that you can stand astride them.  They are called\nPaths that have Made Themselves, and David did wish he could see them doing it.  But, like\nall the most wonderful things that happen in the Gardens, it is done, we concluded, at night\nafter the gates are closed. We have also decided that the paths make themselves because it\nis their only chance of getting to the Round Pond.\n\nOne of these gypsy paths comes from the place where the sheep get their hair cut.  When David\nshed his curls at the hair-dressers, I am told, he said good-bye to them without a tremor,\nthough his mother has never been quite the same bright creature since; so he despises the sheep\nas they run from their shearer, and calls out tauntingly, 'Cowardy, cowardy custard!'  But\nwhen the man grips them between his legs David shakes a fist at him for using such big scissors.\nAnother startling moment is when the man turns back the grimy wool from the sheeps' shoulders\nand they look suddenly like ladies in the stalls of a theatre.  The sheep are so frightened\nby the shearing that it makes them quite white and thin, and as soon as they are set free they\nbegin to nibble the grass at once, quite anxiously, as if they feared that they would never\nbe worth eating.  David wonders whether they know each other, now that they are so different,\nand if it makes them fight with the wrong ones.  They are great fighters, and thus so unlike\ncountry sheep that every year they give my St. Bernard dog, Porthos, a shock. He can make a\nfield of country sheep fly by merely announcing his approach, but these town sheep come toward\nhim with no promise of gentle entertainment, and then a light from last year breaks upon Porthos.\nHe cannot with dignity retreat, but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of\nthe scenery, and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from\nthe corner of his eye.\n\n[Illustration: Porthos]\n\nThe Serpentine begins near here.  It is a lovely lake, and there is a drowned forest at the\nbottom of it.  If you peer over the edge you can see the trees all growing upside down, and\nthey say that at night there are also drowned stars in it.  If so, Peter Pan sees them when\nhe is sailing across the lake in the Thrush's Nest.  A small part only of the Serpentine is\nin the Gardens, for soon it passes beneath a bridge to far away where the island is on which\nall the birds are born that become baby boys and girls.  No one who is human, except Peter\nPan (and he is only half human), can land on the island, but you may write what you want (boy\nor girl, dark or fair) on a piece of paper, and then twist it into the shape of a boat and\nslip it into the water, and it reaches Peter Pan's island after dark.\n\nWe are on the way home now, though of course, it is all pretence that we can go to so many\nof the places in one day.  I should have had to be carrying David long ago, and resting on\nevery seat like old Mr. Salford.  That was what we called him, because he always talked to\nus of a lovely place called Salford where he had been born.  He was a crab-apple of an old\ngentleman who wandered all day in the Gardens from seat to seat trying to fall in with somebody\nwho was acquainted with the town of Salford, and when we had known him for a year or more we\nactually did meet another aged solitary who had once spent Saturday to Monday in Salford. \nHe was meek and timid, and carried his address inside his hat, and whatever part of London\nhe was in search of he always went to Westminster Abbey first as a starting-point.  Him we\ncarried in triumph to our other friend, with the story of that Saturday to Monday, and never\nshall I forget the gloating joy with which Mr. Salford leapt at him.  They have been cronies\never since, and I noticed that Mr. Salford, who naturally does most of the talking, keeps tight\ngrip of the other old man's coat.\n\n[Illustration: _Old Mr. Salford was a crab-apple of an old gentleman who wandered all day in\nthe Gardens._]\n\nThe two last places before you come to our gate are the Dog's Cemetery and the chaffinches\nnest, but we pretend not to know what the Dog's Cemetery is, as Porthos is always with us.\nThe nest is very sad.  It is quite white, and the way we found it was wonderful.  We were having\nanother look among the bushes for David's lost worsted ball, and instead of the ball we found\na lovely nest made of the worsted, and containing four eggs, with scratches on them very like\nDavid's handwriting, so we think they must have been the mother's love-letters to the little\nones inside.  Every day we were in the Gardens we paid a call at the nest, taking care that\nno cruel boy should see us, and we dropped crumbs, and soon the bird knew us as friends, and\nsat in the nest looking at us kindly with her shoulders hunched up.  But one day when we went\nthere were only two eggs in the nest, and the next time there were none.  The saddest part\nof it was that the poor little chaffinch fluttered about the bushes, looking so reproachfully\nat us that we knew she thought we had done it; and though David tried to explain to her, it\nwas so long since he had spoken the bird language that I fear she did not understand.  He and\nI left the Gardens that day with our knuckles in our eyes.\n\nII\n\nPETER PAN\n\nIf you ask your mother whether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a little girl, she will\nsay, 'Why, of course I did, child'; and if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days,\nshe will say, 'What a foolish question to ask; certainly he did.'  Then if you ask your grandmother\nwhether she knew about Peter Pan when she was a girl, she also says, 'Why, of course I did,\nchild,' but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days, she says she never heard\nof his having a goat.  Perhaps she has forgotten, just as she sometimes forgets your name and\ncalls you Mildred, which is your mother's name.  Still, she could hardly forget such an important\nthing as the goat.  Therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl.  This\nshows that, in telling the story of Peter Pan, to begin with the goat (as most people do) is\nas silly as to put on your jacket before your vest.\n\nOf course, it also shows that Peter is ever so old, but he is really always the same age, so\nthat does not matter in the least.  His age is one week, and though he was born so long ago\nhe has never had a birthday, nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one. The\nreason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days old; he escaped by the\nwindow and flew back to the Kensington Gardens.\n\nIf you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape, it shows how completely you have\nforgotten your own young days.  When David heard this story first he was quite certain that\nhe had never tried to escape, but I told him to think back hard, pressing his hands to his\ntemples, and when he had done this hard, and even harder, he distinctly remembered a youthful\ndesire to return to the tree-tops, and with that memory came others, as that he had lain in\nbed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep, and how she had once caught him half-way\nup the chimney.  All children could have such recollections if they would press their hands\nhard to their temples, for, having been birds before they were human, they are naturally a\nlittle wild during the first few weeks, and very itchy at the shoulders, where their wings\nused to be.  So David tells me.\n\nI ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story: First I tell it to him,\nand then he tells it to me, the understanding being that it is quite a different story; and\nthen I retell it with his additions, and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more\nhis story or mine.  In this story of Peter Pan, for instance, the bald narrative and most of\nthe moral reflections are mine, though not all, for this boy can be a stern moralist; but the\ninteresting bits about the ways and customs of babies in the bird-stage are mostly reminiscences\nof David's, recalled by pressing his hands to his temples and thinking hard.\n\nWell, Peter Pan got out by the window, which had no bars.  Standing on the ledge he could see\ntrees far away, which were doubtless the Kensington Gardens, and the moment he saw them he\nentirely forgot that he was now a little boy in a nightgown, and away he flew, right over the\nhouses to the Gardens.  It is wonderful that he could fly without wings, but the place itched\ntremendously, and--and--perhaps we could all fly if we were as dead-confident-sure of our capacity\nto do it as was bold Peter Pan that evening.\n\nHe alighted gaily on the open sward, between the Baby's Palace and the Serpentine, and the\nfirst thing he did was to lie on his back and kick. He was quite unaware already that he had\never been human, and thought he was a bird, even in appearance, just the same as in his early\ndays, and when he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason he missed it was\nbecause he had attempted to seize it with his hand, which, of course, a bird never does.  He\nsaw, however, that it must be past Lock-out Time, for there were a good many fairies about,\nall too busy to notice him; they were getting breakfast ready, milking their cows, drawing\nwater, and so on, and the sight of the water-pails made him thirsty, so he flew over to the\nRound Pond to have a drink.  He stooped and dipped his beak in the pond; he thought it was\nhis beak, but, of course, it was only his nose, and therefore, very little water came up, and\nthat not so refreshing as usual, so next he tried a puddle, and he fell flop into it.  When\na real bird falls in flop, he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry, but Peter could\nnot remember what was the thing to do, and he decided rather sulkily to go to sleep on the\nweeping-beech in the Baby Walk.\n\nAt first he found some difficulty in balancing himself on a branch, but presently he remembered\nthe way, and fell asleep.  He awoke long before morning, shivering, and saying to himself,\n'I never was out on such a cold night'; he had really been out on colder nights when he was\na bird, but, of course, as everybody knows, what seems a warm night to a bird is a cold night\nto a boy in a nightgown.  Peter also felt strangely uncomfortable, as if his head was stuffy;\nhe heard loud noises that made him look round sharply, though they were really himself sneezing.\nThere was something he wanted very much, but, though he knew he wanted it, he could not think\nwhat it was.  What he wanted so much was his mother to blow his nose, but that never struck\nhim, so he decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment.  They are reputed to know a\ngood deal.\n\nThere were two of them strolling along the Baby Walk, with their arms round each other's waists,\nand he hopped down to address them.  The fairies have their tiffs with the birds, but they\nusually give a civil answer to a civil question, and he was quite angry when these two ran\naway the moment they saw him.  Another was lolling on a garden chair, reading a postage-stamp\nwhich some human had let fall, and when he heard Peter's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip.\n\n[Illustration: _When he heard Peter's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip._]\n\nTo Peter's bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from him.  A band of workmen,\nwho were sawing down a toadstool, rushed away, leaving their tools behind them.  A milkmaid\nturned her pail upside down and hid in it.  Soon the Gardens were in an uproar.  Crowds of\nfairies were running this way and that, asking each other stoutly who was afraid; lights were\nextinguished, doors barricaded, and from the grounds of Queen Mab's palace came the rub-a-dub\nof drums, showing that the royal guard had been called out.  A regiment of Lancers came charging\ndown the Broad Walk, armed with holly-leaves, with which they jag the enemy horribly in passing.\nPeter heard the little people crying everywhere that there was a human in the Gardens after\nLock-out Time, but he never thought for a moment that he was the human.  He was feeling stuffier\nand stuffier, and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose, but he pursued\nthem with the vital question in vain; the timid creatures ran from him, and even the Lancers,\nwhen he approached them up the Hump, turned swiftly into a side-walk, on the pretence that\nthey saw him there.\n\nDespairing of the fairies, he resolved to consult the birds, but now he remembered, as an odd\nthing, that all the birds on the weeping-beech had flown away when he alighted on it, and though\nthis had not troubled him at the time, he saw its meaning now.  Every living thing was shunning\nhim.  Poor little Peter Pan! he sat down and cried, and even then he did not know that, for\na bird, he was sitting on his wrong part.  It is a blessing that he did not know, for otherwise\nhe would have lost faith in his power to fly, and the moment you doubt whether you can fly,\nyou cease for ever to be able to do it.  The reason birds can fly and we can't is simply that\nthey have perfect faith, for to have faith is to have wings.\n\nNow, except by flying, no one can reach the island in the Serpentine, for the boats of humans\nare forbidden to land there, and there are stakes round it, standing up in the water, on each\nof which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night.  It was to the island that Peter now flew to\nput his strange case before old Solomon Caw, and he alighted on it with relief, much heartened\nto find himself at last at home, as the birds call the island.  All of them were asleep, including\nthe sentinels, except Solomon, who was wide awake on one side, and he listened quietly to Peter's\nadventures, and then told him their true meaning.\n\n[Illustration: _Put his strange case before old Solomon Caw._]\n\n'Look at your nightgown, if you don't believe me,' Solomon said; and with staring eyes Peter\nlooked at his nightgown, and then at the sleeping birds.  Not one of them wore anything.\n\n'How many of your toes are thumbs?' said Solomon a little cruelly, and Peter saw to his consternation,\nthat all his toes were fingers.  The shock was so great that it drove away his cold.\n\n'Ruffle your feathers,' said that grim old Solomon, and Peter tried most desperately hard to\nruffle his feathers, but he had none.  Then he rose up, quaking, and for the first time since\nhe stood on the window ledge, he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him.\n\n'I think I shall go back to mother,' he said timidly.\n\n'Good-bye,' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look.\n\nBut Peter hesitated.  'Why don't you go?' the old one asked politely.\n\n'I suppose,' said Peter huskily, 'I suppose I can still fly.'\n\nYou see he had lost faith.\n\n'Poor little half-and-half!' said Solomon, who was not really hard-hearted, 'you will never\nbe able to fly again, not even on windy days.  You must live here on the island always.'\n\n'And never even go to the Kensington Gardens?' Peter asked tragically.\n\n'How could you get across?' said Solomon.  He promised very kindly, however, to teach Peter\nas many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape.\n\n'Then I shan't be exactly a human?' Peter asked.\n\n'No.'\n\n'Nor exactly a bird?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'What shall I be?'\n\n'You will be a Betwixt-and-Between,' Solomon said, and certainly he was a wise old fellow,\nfor that is exactly how it turned out.\n\nThe birds on the island never got used to him.  His oddities tickled them every day, as if\nthey were quite new, though it was really the birds that were new.  They came out of the eggs\ndaily, and laughed at him at once; then off they soon flew to be humans, and other birds came\nout of other eggs; and so it went on for ever.  The crafty mother-birds, when they tired of\nsitting on their eggs, used to get the young ones to break their shells a day before the right\ntime by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating.\nThousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things, just as you watch the peacocks,\nand they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead\nof in the usual way with the mouth.  All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon's\norders by the birds.  He would not eat worms or insects (which they thought very silly of him),\nso they brought him bread in their beaks.  Thus, when you cry out, 'Greedy! Greedy!' to the\nbird that flies away with the big crust, you know now that you ought not to do this, for he\nis very likely taking it to Peter Pan.\n\nPeter wore no nightgown now.  You see, the birds were always begging him for bits of it to\nline their nests with, and, being very good-natured, he could not refuse, so by Solomon's advice\nhe had hidden what was left of it.  But, though he was now quite naked, you must not think\nthat he was cold or unhappy.  He was usually very happy and gay, and the reason was that Solomon\nhad kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways.  To be easily pleased, for instance,\nand always to be really doing something, and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing\nof vast importance.  Peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their nests; soon\nhe could build better than a wood-pigeon, and nearly as well as a blackbird, though never did\nhe satisfy the finches, and he made nice little water-troughs near the nests and dug up worms\nfor the young ones with his fingers.  He also became very learned in bird-lore, and knew an\neast wind from a west wind by its smell, and he could see the grass growing and hear the insects\nwalking about inside the tree-trunks.  But the best thing Solomon had done was to teach him\nto have a glad heart.  All birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests, and so as they\nwere the only kind of heart Solomon knew about, it was easy to him to teach Peter how to have one.\n\nPeter's heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long, just as the birds sing for\njoy, but, being partly human, he needed an instrument, so he made a pipe of reeds, and he used\nto sit by the shore of the island of an evening, practising the sough of the wind and the ripple\nof the water, and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon, and he put them all in his pipe\nand played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived, and they would say to each\nother, 'Was that a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe?'\nAnd sometimes he played the birth of birds, and then the mothers would turn round in their\nnests to see whether they had laid an egg.  If you are a child of the Gardens you must know\nthe chestnut-tree near the bridge, which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts, but\nperhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way.  It is because Peter wearies for summer\nand plays that it has come, and the chestnut being so near, hears him and is cheated.\n\nBut as Peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes fell into sad thoughts,\nand then the music became sad also, and the reason of all this sadness was that he could not\nreach the Gardens, though he could see them through the arch of the bridge."}

{"ID": 1420, "text": "Vignaud seems to me to stand higher\nthan all modern workers in this field in the patient and fearless\ndiscovery of the truth regarding certain very controversial matters,\nand also in ability to give a sound and reasonable interpretation to\nthose obscurer facts or deductions in Columbus's life that seem doomed\nnever to be settled by the aid of documents alone.  It may be unseemly in\nme not to acknowledge indebtedness to Washington Irving,  but I cannot\nconscientiously do so.  If I had been writing ten or fifteen years ago I\nmight have taken his work seriously; but it is impossible that anything\nso one-sided, so inaccurate, so untrue to life, and so profoundly dull\ncould continue to exist save in the absence of any critical knowledge or\nlight on the subject.  All that can be said for him is that he kept the\nlamp of interest in Columbus alive for English readers during the period\nthat preceded the advent of modern critical research.  Mr. Major's\nedition' of Columbus's letters has been freely consulted by me, as it\nmust be by any one interested in the subject.  Professor Justin Winsor's\nwork has provided an invaluable store of ripe scholarship in matters of\ncosmography and geographical detail; Sir Clements Markham's book, by far\nthe most trustworthy of modern English works on the subject, and a\nvaluable record of the established facts in Columbus's life, has proved a\nsound guide in nautical matters; while the monograph of Mr. Elton, which\napparently did not promise much at first, since the author has followed\nsome untrustworthy leaders as regards his facts, proved to be full of a\nfragrant charm produced by the writer's knowledge of and interest in\nsub-tropical vegetation; and it is delightfully filled with the names of\ngums and spices.  To Mr. Vignaud I owe special thanks, not only for the\nbenefits of his research and of his admirable works on Columbus, but also\nfor personal help and encouragement.  Equally cordial thanks are due to\nMr. John Boyd Thacher,  whose work, giving as it does so large a\nselection of the Columbus documents both in facsimile, transliteration,\nand translation, is of the greatest service to every English writer on\nthe subject of Columbus.  It is the more to be regretted, since the\ndocumentary part of Mr. Thacher's work is so excellent, that in his\ncritical studies he should have seemed to ignore some of the more\nimportant results of modern research.  I am further particularly indebted\nto Mr. Thacher and to his publishers, Messrs.

In a beggar's rags few men could be more than beggars. In\nkingly robes, most men could be kings; could achieve the finished and\nfearless behaviour that is said to distinguish royalty.\n\nBunker Bean, the divinely credulous, now daily arrayed himself in royal\nvestures, set a well-fashioned crown upon the brow of him and strode\nforth, sceptre in hand. Invisible were these trappings, to be sure; he\nwas still no marked man in a city street. But at least they were there\nto his own truth-lit eyes, and he most truly did \"expand his chest, draw\nin his waist, and stand erect.\" Yea, in the full gaze of inhumanly large\npolicemen would he do these things.\n\nThis, indeed, was one of the first prerogatives his royalty claimed. He\ndiscovered that it was not necessary for any but criminals to fear\npolicemen. It might still be true that an honest man of moderate\nphysique and tender sensibilities could not pass one without slight\ntremors of self-consciousness; but by such they were--a most prodigious\nthought--to be regarded as one's paid employees; within the law one\nmight even greet them pleasantly in passing, and be answered civilly.\nBean was now equal to approaching one and saying, \"Good evening,\nOfficer!\" He would sometimes cross a street merely to perform this\napparently barren rite. It stiffened his spine. It helped him to realize\nthat he had indeed been a king and the sire of kings; that kingly stuff\nwas in him.\n\nSo marked an advance in his spirit was not made in a day, however. It\ncame only after long dwelling in thought upon his splendid past. And,\ntoo, after he had envisioned the circumstance that he was now a man of\nmeans. The latter was not less difficult of realization than his\nkingship. He had thought little about money, save at destitute moments;\nhad dreamed of riches as a vague, rather pleasant and not important\npossibility. But kings were rich; no sooner had his kingship been\nproclaimed than money was in his hand. And, of course, more money would\ncome to him, as it had once come on the banks of the Nile. He did not\nquestion how nor whence. He only knew.\n\nIt was three days before he bethought himself to finish the reading of\nAunt Clara's letter, suspended at sight of the astounding enclosure."}

Ces paysans\nn'avaient pas d'enfants, et ils \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s tristes. Un jour, en hiver,\nle paysan \u00e9tait assis \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre. Il vit les enfants du village qui\njouaient dans la neige. Les enfants \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9s. Ils faisaient\nune bonne femme de neige.\n\nIvan dit \u00e0 sa femme: \"Ma femme, regardez ces enfants, ils s'amusent, ils\nfont une bonne femme de neige. Venez dans le jardin, amusons-nous \u00e0\nfaire une bonne femme de neige.\"\n\nLe paysan et sa femme all\u00e8rent dans le jardin, et la femme dit: \"Mon\nmari, nous n'avons pas d'enfants; faisons un enfant de neige.\"\n\n\"Voil\u00e0 une bonne id\u00e9e!\" dit l'homme. Et il commen\u00e7a \u00e0 fa\u00e7onner un petit\ncorps, de petites mains, de petits pieds. La femme fa\u00e7onna une petite\nt\u00eate et la pla\u00e7a sur les \u00e9paules de la statue de neige.\n\nUn homme passait sur la route; il les regarda un instant en silence,\npuis il dit: \"Dieu vous aide.\"\n\n\"Merci,\" dit Ivan.\n\n\"Le secours de Dieu est toujours bon \u00e0 quelque chose,\" r\u00e9pondit Marie.\n\n\"Que faites-vous donc?\" demanda le passant.\n\n\"Nous faisons une fille de neige,\" dit Ivan. Et en parlant ainsi il fit\nle nez, le menton, la bouche et les yeux. En quelques minutes l'enfant\nde neige \u00e9tait finie. Ivan la regarda avec admiration. Tout \u00e0 coup il\nremarqua que la bouche et les yeux s'ouvraient. Les joues et les l\u00e8vres\nchang\u00e8rent de couleur, et quelques minutes apr\u00e8s il vit devant lui une\nenfant vivante.\n\n\"Qui \u00eates-vous?\" dit-il tout surpris de voir une enfant vivante \u00e0 la\nplace de la petite statue de neige.\n\n\"Je suis Blanche-Neige, votre fille,\" dit l'enfant, et elle embrassa\nl'homme et la femme, qui commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 pleurer de joie. Les parents\nconduisirent Blanche-Neige dans la maison, et elle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 grandir\ntr\u00e8s rapidement.\n\nToutes les petites filles du village arriv\u00e8rent chez le paysan pour\njouer avec la charmante petite fille. Elle \u00e9tait si bonne et si jolie.\nElle \u00e9tait blanche comme la neige, elle avait les yeux bleus comme le\nciel, sa longue chevelure dor\u00e9e \u00e9tait admirable, et bien que ses joues\nne fussent pas aussi roses que celles des autres enfants du village,\nelle \u00e9tait si douce que tout le monde l'aimait beaucoup.\n\nL'hiver se passa tr\u00e8s rapidement, et Blanche-Neige grandit si vite que\nquand le soleil du printemps fit verdir l'herbe, elle \u00e9tait aussi grande\nqu'une fille de douze ou treize ans. Pendant l'hiver Blanche-Neige\navait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s gaie, mais quand le beau temps arriva elle \u00e9tait\ntoute triste. La m\u00e8re Marie remarqua sa tristesse, et dit: \"Ma ch\u00e8re\nenfant, pourquoi \u00eates-vous triste? \u00cates-vous malade?\" \"Non, je ne suis\npas malade, ma bonne m\u00e8re,\" r\u00e9pondit l'enfant, et elle resta tranquille\ndans la maison.\n\nLes petites filles du village arriv\u00e8rent et dirent: \"Blanche-Neige,\nvenez avec nous, venez avec nous, nous allons au bois cueillir des\nfleurs.\"\n\n\"Voil\u00e0 une bonne id\u00e9e!\" dit Marie. \"Allez au bois avec vos petites\namies, mon enfant, allez et amusez-vous bien!\"\n\nLes enfants partirent. Elles all\u00e8rent au bois, elles cueillirent des\nfleurs, elles firent des bouquets et des couronnes, et quand le soir\narriva elles firent un grand feu.\n\n\"Maintenant, Blanche-Neige, regardez bien et faites comme nous,\"\ndirent-elles, et elles commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 chanter et \u00e0 danser. Elles\nsaut\u00e8rent aussi l'une apr\u00e8s l'autre \u00e0 travers le feu.[7] Tout \u00e0 coup\nelles entendirent une exclamation: \"Ah!\" Toutes les petites filles\nregard\u00e8rent, et un instant apr\u00e8s elles remarqu\u00e8rent que Blanche-Neige\nn'\u00e9tait plus l\u00e0.\n\n[Note 7: Jumping through the fire is a vestige of heathenism.]\n\n\"Blanche-Neige, o\u00f9 \u00eates-vous?\" cri\u00e8rent-elles, mais Blanche-Neige ne\nr\u00e9pondit pas. Les petites filles cherch\u00e8rent en vain, elles ne\ntrouv\u00e8rent pas leur petite compagne. Ivan, Marie et tous les paysans\ncherch\u00e8rent aussi en vain, car la petite Blanche-Neige s'\u00e9tait chang\u00e9e\nen une petite vapeur au contact du feu, et elle s'\u00e9tait envol\u00e9e vers le\nciel d'o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait venue sous la forme d'un flocon de neige.\n\n\nLES TROIS CITRONS.[8]\n\n\n[Note 8: One of the Austro-Hungarian folk tales. Different versions\nof this story have been given, among others by Wratislaw, in his \"Sixty\nFolk Tales from exclusively Slavonic Sources,\" and by Laboulaye in his\nwell-known \"Fairy Book.\"]\n\nIl y avait une fois un prince beau comme le jour, riche et aimable. Le\nroi, son p\u00e8re, d\u00e9sirait beaucoup de le voir mari\u00e9, et tous les jours il\nlui disait: \"Mon fils, pourquoi ne choisissez-vous pas une femme parmi\ntoutes les belles demoiselles de la cour?\" Mais le fils regardait toutes\nles demoiselles avec indiff\u00e9rence, et refusait toujours de choisir une\nfemme. Enfin, un jour, fatigu\u00e9 des remontrances de son p\u00e8re, il dit:\n\n\"Mon p\u00e8re, vous d\u00e9sirez me voir mari\u00e9. Je n'aime pas les demoiselles de\nla cour. Elles ne sont pas assez jolies pour me plaire. Je propose de\nfaire un long voyage, tout autour du monde, si c'est n\u00e9cessaire, et\nquand je trouverai une princesse, aussi blanche que la neige, aussi\nbelle que le jour, et aussi intelligente et aimable qu'un ange, je la\nprendrai pour femme, sans h\u00e9siter.\"\n\nLe roi \u00e9tait enchant\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision, dit adieu \u00e0 son fils, lui\nsouhaita un bon voyage, et le prince partit tout joyeux.\n\nIl commen\u00e7a son voyage gaiement, et alla tout droit devant lui. Enfin il\narriva \u00e0 la mer, o\u00f9 il trouva un beau vaisseau \u00e0 l'ancre. Il s'embarqua\nsur ce vaisseau, et quelques minutes apr\u00e8s des mains myst\u00e9rieuses et\ninvisibles lev\u00e8rent l'ancre, et le vaisseau quitta rapidement le port.\nLe prince navigua ainsi pendant trois jours. Alors le vaisseau arriva \u00e0\nune \u00eele.\n\nLe prince d\u00e9barqua avec son cheval, et continua son voyage, malgr\u00e9 le\nfroid intense et la neige et la glace qui l'entouraient de tous c\u00f4t\u00e9s.\nLe prince \u00e9tait surpris de se trouver d\u00e9j\u00e0 en hiver, mais il continua\nbravement son chemin. Il arriva enfin \u00e0 une toute petite maison blanche.\nIl heurta (=frappa) \u00e0 la porte, et une vieille dame, aux cheveux blancs,\nouvrit la porte.\n\n\"Que cherchez-vous, jeune homme?\" demanda-t-elle.\n\n\"Je cherche une femme, la plus jolie au monde; pouvez-vous me dire o\u00f9 la\ntrouver?\" r\u00e9pondit le prince.\n\n\"Non, il n'y a pas de femme pour vous dans mon royaume. Je suis l'Hiver,\nje n'ai pas le temps de m'occuper de mariages. Mais allez visiter ma\nsoeur, l'Automne, elle vous trouvera peut-\u00eatre la femme id\u00e9ale que vous\ncherchez.\"\n\nLe prince remercia la belle dame aux cheveux blancs, remonta \u00e0 cheval,\ncontinua son chemin et remarqua bient\u00f4t que la neige et la glace avaient\ndisparu, et que les arbres \u00e9taient tout couverts de beaux fruits. Il\narriva bient\u00f4t apr\u00e8s \u00e0 une petite maison brune, et frappa \u00e0 la porte.\nUne belle dame, aux yeux et aux cheveux noirs, ouvrit la porte, et\ndemanda d'une voix bien douce:\n\n\"Que voulez-vous, jeune homme, et que cherchez-vous ici dans mon\nroyaume?\"\n\n\"Je cherche une femme,\" r\u00e9pondit le prince sans h\u00e9sitation.\n\n\"Une femme!\" r\u00e9p\u00e9ta la belle dame avec surprise. \"Je n'ai pas de femme\npour vous. Je suis l'Automne, et je suis tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9e, je vous assure,\ncar j'ai tous les fruits \u00e0 cueillir. Allez faire visite \u00e0 ma soeur,\nl'\u00c9t\u00e9, elle aura peut-\u00eatre le temps de s'occuper de vous et de vous\ntrouver une jolie femme.\"\n\nLe prince, ainsi cong\u00e9di\u00e9, continua son voyage. Il remarqua avant bien\nlongtemps que l'herbe \u00e9tait haute, que le feuillage \u00e9tait \u00e9pais, et que\nle bl\u00e9 \u00e9tait m\u00fbr. Il n'avait plus froid, au contraire il avait bien\nchaud, et il fut tr\u00e8s content d'apercevoir une petite maison jaune, \u00e0\npeu de distance. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte de cette petite maison, il heurta, et\nune jolie femme, aux cheveux bruns et aux joues rouges, ouvrit la porte\nen demandant:\n\n\"Que voulez-vous, jeune homme, et que cherchez-vous dans mon royaume?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" dit le prince avec la plus grande politesse, \"j'ai eu\nl'honneur de faire visite \u00e0 vos deux soeurs, l'Hiver et l'Automne.

Pouvez-vous me\nprocurer la femme charmante que je cherche depuis si longtemps en vain?\"\n\n\"Ah, mon prince,\" r\u00e9pondit la belle dame aux cheveux bruns et aux joues\nrouges, \"je suis aussi fort occup\u00e9e, et je n'ai pas le temps de vous\ntrouver une femme. Mais allez faire visite \u00e0 ma soeur, le Printemps,\nelle vous aidera certainement.\"\n\nLe prince la remercia et partit. Quelques minutes apr\u00e8s il remarqua que\nl'herbe \u00e9tait d'un vert plus tendre, que tous les arbres \u00e9taient\ncouverts de fleurs, et vit une petite maison verte, au milieu d'un\njardin, o\u00f9 il y avait une grande quantit\u00e9 de belles fleurs: des tulipes,\ndes jacinthes, des jonquilles, des violettes, des lilas, des muguets,\netc., etc.\n\nNotre h\u00e9ros heurta \u00e0 la porte de cette petite maison, et une dame aux\ncheveux blonds et aux yeux bleus parut imm\u00e9diatement. \"Que\ncherchez-vous, jeune homme,\" demanda-t-elle?\n\n\"Je cherche une femme.

Quand il eut fini son repas, le Printemps lui apporta\ntrois beaux citrons, un joli couteau d'argent et une magnifique coupe\nd'or, et dit:\n\n\"Prince, voici trois citrons, un couteau d'argent et une coupe d'or.

Il passa \u00e0 travers le royaume du\nPrintemps, de l'\u00c9t\u00e9, de l'Automne, de l'Hiver, arriva au bord de la mer,\ntrouva le vaisseau, s'embarqua, et arriva au bout de trois jours, au\nport o\u00f9 il s'\u00e9tait embarqu\u00e9. Quelques jours apr\u00e8s il arriva \u00e0 la\nfontaine pr\u00e8s du ch\u00e2teau de son p\u00e8re.\n\nIl descendit de cheval, prit les trois citrons et le couteau d'argent,\nremplit la coupe d'or d'eau pure \u00e0 la fontaine, et quand ces pr\u00e9paratifs\nfurent tous finis il coupa le premier citron d'une main tremblante. Au\nm\u00eame instant une princesse, belle comme le jour, se pr\u00e9senta devant lui,\net dit timidement: \"Prince, j'ai soif, voulez-vous, s'il-vous-pla\u00eet, me\ndonner \u00e0 boire?\"\n\nMais le prince \u00e9tait si occup\u00e9 \u00e0 l'admirer, qu'il oublia la\nrecommandation du Printemps, et ne lui donna pas \u00e0 boire. La princesse\nle regarda un instant d'un air de reproche, et puis elle disparut. Le\nprince, au d\u00e9sespoir, pleura et se lamenta. Il dit cent fois, au moins,\nqu'il \u00e9tait bien stupide de laisser \u00e9chapper une si belle princesse, et\nenfin il se d\u00e9cida \u00e0 couper le second citron.\n\nUne seconde princesse, plus belle que la premi\u00e8re, se pr\u00e9senta\naussit\u00f4t, et dit: \"Prince, j'ai soif, donnez-moi \u00e0 boire,\ns'il-vous-pla\u00eet.\" Mais le pauvre prince \u00e9tait si surpris de sa beaut\u00e9,\nqu'il resta l\u00e0, la bouche ouverte, et oublia de lui donner \u00e0 boire. La\nseconde princesse le regarda d'un air de reproche, et disparut aussi.\nAlors le prince pleura et se lamenta, et dit au moins deux cents fois:\n\"Je suis stupide, tr\u00e8s stupide,\" mais la princesse avait compl\u00e8tement\ndisparu.\n\nApr\u00e8s avoir pleur\u00e9 longtemps, le prince se d\u00e9cida \u00e0 couper le troisi\u00e8me\ncitron, et une troisi\u00e8me princesse, plus belle que les deux autres, se\npr\u00e9senta devant lui: \"Prince,\" dit-elle, timidement, \"j'ai soif,\ndonnez-moi \u00e0 boire, s'il-vous-pla\u00eet.\"\n\nLe prince lui donna \u00e0 boire imm\u00e9diatement. Alors la princesse s'assit \u00e0\nc\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui, et quand il lui demanda si elle voulait bien \u00eatre sa femme,\nelle rougit, et dit, \"Oui.\"\n\nLe prince la regarda avec admiration, et dit: \"Que vous \u00eates belle! Vous\n\u00eates la plus belle personne du monde, j'en suis s\u00fbr! Mais votre robe\nn'est pas belle. Elle est trop modeste. Attendez ici, et j'irai au\nch\u00e2teau de mon p\u00e8re, chercher une belle robe de satin blanc et une\nvoiture pour vous pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 mon p\u00e8re comme une grande dame.\"\n\nLa princesse \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s timide; elle avait peur de rester seule, mais\nenfin elle consentit \u00e0 rester pr\u00e8s de la fontaine, et le prince partit.\nIl alla au ch\u00e2teau de son p\u00e8re, dit qu'il avait trouv\u00e9 une princesse,\nblanche comme la neige, belle comme le jour, et aimable et intelligente\ncomme un ange, et promit de la pr\u00e9senter dans une heure.\n\nAlors le prince alla demander une belle robe de satin blanc \u00e0 sa soeur\nfavorite, donna ordre de pr\u00e9parer la plus belle voiture, et fit tous les\npr\u00e9paratifs n\u00e9cessaires pour recevoir la princesse avec honneur. Quand\ntout fut pr\u00eat, il monta en voiture pour aller chercher la belle\nprincesse qu'il \u00e9tait impatient de revoir.\n\nPendant son absence, la princesse, qui avait peur de rester l\u00e0 toute\nseule, grimpa dans un grand arbre, pr\u00e8s de la fontaine, et se cacha dans\nle feuillage. Tout son corps \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement cach\u00e9, mais sa jolie\nfigure \u00e9tait visible, et se refl\u00e9tait dans l'eau pure de la fontaine,\ncomme dans un miroir.\n\nQuelques minutes apr\u00e8s, une n\u00e9gresse arriva \u00e0 la fontaine pour chercher\nde l'eau. Elle avait une grande cruche, elle se pencha sur l'eau, vit la\njolie figure, et regarda \u00e0 droite et \u00e0 gauche pour d\u00e9couvrir la personne\n\u00e0 qui cette jolie figure appartenait. Mais elle ne vit personne, et\nd\u00e9cida bient\u00f4t que l'image qu'elle voyait dans l'eau \u00e9tait celle de sa\npropre figure:\n\n\"Oh, que je suis jolie,\" dit-elle avec joie. \"Que je suis jolie. Je suis\naussi jolie qu'une princesse. Ma ma\u00eetresse dit toujours: 'Lucie, vous\n\u00eates laide, laide \u00e0 faire peur,' mais ce n'est pas vrai. Je suis jolie,\net ma ma\u00eetresse est jalouse parce que je suis plus jolie qu'elle. Je\nsuis trop jolie pour porter de l'eau!\" Et la n\u00e9gresse cassa sa cruche\nsur les pierres, et retourna chez sa ma\u00eetresse, qui attendait l'eau avec\nimpatience.\n\n\"O\u00f9 est la cruche?\" demanda-t-elle. \"O\u00f9 est l'eau que je vous ai dit de\nm'apporter?\"\n\n\"J'ai cass\u00e9 la cruche, je suis trop jolie pour porter de l'eau,\" dit la\nn\u00e9gresse.\n\n\"Vous! Jolie!\" dit la dame avec \u00e9tonnement (surprise), \"vous \u00eates laide\n\u00e0 faire peur!\" Et la ma\u00eetresse, en col\u00e8re, battit la pauvre n\u00e9gresse,\nlui donna une autre cruche, et la renvoya, en pleurant \u00e0 la fontaine.\n\nLa n\u00e9gresse retourna lentement \u00e0 la fontaine, se pencha sur l'eau, vit\nla m\u00eame jolie figure, et dit: \"Oh, que je suis jolie! Je suis s\u00fbre que\nje suis la plus jolie personne du monde! Je ne porterai pas l'eau pour\nma ma\u00eetresse,\" et elle cassa la seconde cruche et retourna \u00e0 la maison\nsans eau.\n\n\"O\u00f9 est l'eau de la fontaine, esclave?\" demanda la ma\u00eetresse\nimp\u00e9rieusement.\n\n\"L'eau est dans la fontaine, et la cruche est cass\u00e9e. Je ne serai plus\nvotre servante. Je suis trop jolie. Je suis assez jolie pour \u00e9pouser le\nprince.\"\n\nAlors la ma\u00eetresse commen\u00e7a \u00e0 rire, et dit: \"Que vous \u00eates absurde,\nLucie; vous \u00eates laide, laide \u00e0 faire peur; retournez \u00e0 la fontaine!\"\n\nLa n\u00e9gresse retourna \u00e0 la fontaine avec une troisi\u00e8me cruche et se\npencha sur l'eau. Quand elle vit la jolie figure, r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie dans l'eau\nlimpide, elle dit: \"Oh, que je suis jolie!\" et cette fois elle parla si\nhaut que la princesse dans l'arbre l'entendit. Amus\u00e9e par ces\nexclamations, elle se mit \u00e0 rire. La n\u00e9gresse, surprise, leva la t\u00eate,\net vit la jolie princesse: \"Ah,\" pensa-t-elle, \"c'est cette personne-l\u00e0\nqui a caus\u00e9 tout mon malheur! Je me vengerai!\""}

{"ID": 30, "text": "He was consumed by greed and covetousness, indulging in the love of wealth. He built numerous deer parks, instituting laws that punished anyone who killed a deer by depriving them of their sight. Not only did he forbid the killing of deer, but also boars, showing a paternal love towards them. Even hares were exempt from harm. While his wealthy subjects bemoaned his actions, the poor were left in fear. However, he was so resolute in his ways that he disregarded the hatred of all those who opposed him, for obedience to the king's will was necessary for survival, land, property, and even peace. It is unfortunate that a man could be so arrogant and boastful over others. May the Almighty God have mercy on his soul and forgive his sins. We have recounted both his good and bad deeds so that others may strive towards good and avoid his wrongdoings, thereby seeking the path to the Kingdom of Heaven. In this same year, many events occurred, including the Danes' treacherous turning away from their former truths to disloyalty, ultimately killing their chosen king, Cnute, in a church. Also, the heathens in Spain waged war against Christians, conquering much of the land. However, Christian King Alphonzo called for aid, and Christians from all over came to support him, defeating the heathens and reclaiming their land with the help of God. In England, many influential individuals passed away, such as Bishop Stigand of Chichester, the Abbots of St. Augustine, Bath, and Pershore, and the former king, William."}

{"ID": 1273, "text": "\"Do you think I'm here to bandy\nwords with you, fool? I demand my answer.\"\n\n\"And as for that,\" continued Sam as evenly as if he had not been\ninterrupted, \"your proposition was so preposterous that it could have\ncome only from you, and deserved no answer. But since you want it\nformally, sir, it's no.\"\n\nFor a moment I feared Bohun would have a stroke. The back of the chair\nI had just vacated and his stick alone supported him through that dumb,\nterrible transport. He shook so violently that I looked momentarily to\nsee the chair break beneath him. There was insanity in his eyes. When\nfinally he was able to articulate it was in broken gasps.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" he stammered. \"It's a lie. I don't believe it.\nIt's madness--the girl wouldn't be so mad. ...\"\n\n\"What is it, father?\"\n\nI don't know which of us three was the more startled by that simple\nquestion in Betty Graham's voice; Sam, at all events, showed the least\nsurprise; the old colonel wheeled toward the back of the store, his jaw\ndropping and his eyes protruding as though he were confronted with a\nghost. As, in a way, he was: even I had been struck by that strange,\nheartrending similarity to her mother's tone; and even I trembled a\nlittle to hear that voice, as it seemed, from beyond the grave.\n\nBetty stood at the foot of the staircase; alarmed by the noise of the\ncolonel's raging, she had stolen down, unheard by any of us. And in\nthat moment I realised as never before that the girl had more of her\nmother in her than lay in that marvellous reproduction of Margaret\nGraham's voice. As she waited there one detected in her pose something\nof her mother's quiet dignity, in her eyes more than a little of\nMargaret's tragedy. Of Margaret's beauty I saw scant trace, I own; but\nin those days my eyes were blinded by the signs of overwork and\ninsufficient nourishment that marred her young features, by the\nhopeless dowdiness of her garments.\n\nAbruptly she moved swiftly to her father's side and slipped her hand\ninto his. \"What is it, father?\" she repeated, eyeing Colonel Bohun\ncoldly.\n\nI thought Sam's eyes filled. His lips trembled and he had to struggle\nto master his voice. He smiled through it all, tenderly at his girl,\nbut there was in that smile the weakness of the child grown old, the\ndependence of the man whose womanfolk must ever mother him.\n\n\"Why, Betty,\" he said, tremulous--\"why, Betty, your grandfather here\nhas been kind enough to offer to take you and educate you and make a\nlady of you, and--and we were just talking it over, dear, just talking\nit over.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that?\" she flung at Bohun.\n\nHe straightened up and held himself well in hand. \"Is it the first you\nhave heard of it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She looked inquiringly at her father.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell her?\" Bohun persisted harshly. \"Were you afraid?\"\n\n\"No.\" Sam shook his head slowly. \"I wasn't\nafraid. But it was unnecessary.... You see, Betty, Colonel Bohun is\nwilling to do all this for you on several conditions. You must leave me\nand never see me again; you mustn't even recognise me should we meet\nupon the street; you must change your name to Bohun and never permit\nyourself to be known as Betty Graham. Then you must--\"\n\n\"Never mind, daddy dear,\" said the girl. \"That is enough. I know now--I\nunderstand why you never told me. It's impossible. Colonel Bohun knew\nthat when he made the offer, of course; he made it simply to harass\nyou, daddy. It's his revenge....\"\n\nShe looked Bohun up and down with a glance of contempt that would have\nwithered another man, poor, wan, haggard little maid of all work that\nshe was.\n\n\"And that's your answer, miss?\" he snapped, livid with wrath.\n\n\"I would not,\" she told him slowly, \"accept a favour from you, sir, if\nI were starving....\"\n\nBohun drew himself up. \"Then starve,\" he told her; and walked out of\nthe shop.\n\nI gaped after his retreating figure. It seemed impossible, incredible,\nthat he should have taken such an answer without yielding to a fit of\ninsensate passion. And I was still marvelling when I heard Graham\nsaying in a broken voice: \"Betty! Betty, my little girl!\"\n\nThen I, too, went away, with a mist before my eyes to dim the golden\ngrace of June.\n\n\nVI\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO MISS CARPENTER\n\nOn my way back from the Flats I discovered Duncan sitting on the wall\nof the bridge, moodily donating pebbles to the water. His attitude\nsuggested preoccupation with unhappy reflections, a humour from which\nthe sound of my footsteps roused him. He looked up and caught my eye\nwith an uncertain nod, as though he half recognised me--presumably\nhaving casually noticed me at the Bigelow House the previous evening.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said I cheerfully, with a slight break in my stride\nintended craftily to convey the impression that I was not altogether\naverse to a pause for gossip.\n\nHe said \"Good-morning,\" sombrely.\n\n\"A pleasant day,\" I observed spontaneously, stopping.\n\n\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"By the way, have you a match about you?\"\n\nI searched my pockets, found a box and handed it over.\n\n\"I've been perishing for a ...\" He slid his fingers into a waistcoat\npocket, as one who should seek a cigarette-case; but the hand came\nforth empty. He bit his remark off abruptly, with a blank look in his\neyes which was promptly succeeded by an expression of deepest chagrin.\nHe got up and with a little bow returned the box.\n\n\"I forgot,\" he said, apologetic.\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't help you out,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right. I'd just forgotten that I don't smoke.\"\n\nI pretended not to notice his disconcertion.\n\n\"You're to be congratulated; it's a shameful waste of time and money.\"\n\n\"A filthy habit,\" said he warmly.\n\n\"Indeed, yes,\" I chanted, finding my pipe and tobacco pouch.\n\nHe caught my twinkle as I filled and lighted, and looked away, the\nshadow of a smile lurking beneath his small, closely clipped moustache.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said a moment later, regarding me with more\ninterest, \"but--do you live here?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Why?\"\n\n\"I was sure of it,\" he replied soberly. \"But don't you feel a bit\nlonesome, sometimes?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. Radville's one of the most interesting places on\nthis side of the footstool.\" He sighed. \"Indeed,\" I insisted, \"you\nwon't feel any more lonely after you've lived here a while, than I do\nnow, Mr. Duncan.\"\n\nHe opened his eyes at my acquaintance with his name, but jerked his\nhead at me comprehendingly.\n\n\"To be sure,\" he said. \"You would know. But I'm only beginning to\nrealise what it feels like to be a marked man.\"\n\n\"I hear you intend to make Radville your permanent residence, Mr.\nDuncan?\"\n\n\"It's part of the system,\" he said obscurely. \"It may prove a life\nsentence.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you'll like it here?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm strong for Radville,\" he declared earnestly. \"It's all to the\nmerry ... I beg your pardon.\"\n\nI stared curiously to see him colour like a school-girl. \"What for?\"\n\n\"My mistake, sir; I forgot myself again. I don't use slang.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I commented, wondering. He was beginning to puzzle me.\n\nIn the pause the air began to rock with the heavy clanging of the clock\nin the Methodist Church steeple.\n\n\"That's noon,\" I said. \"We'll have to cut along: dinner's ready.\"\n\nDuncan immediately replanted himself firmly upon the parapet. \"I know\nit,\" he said with some indignation.\n\nAgain bewildered, I hesitated, but eventually advanced: \"Our ways run\ntogether, Mr. Duncan, as far as the Bigelow House. My name is\nLittlejohn--Homer Littlejohn.\"\n\nHe rose again to take my hand and assured me he was glad to make my\nacquaintance. \"But,\" he added morosely, \"I'll be damned if I go back to\nthat hotel before dinner's over.... Great Scott! I forgot again. I\ndon't swear!\"\n\n\"Have you any other unnatural accomplishments?\" I inquired, chuckling.\n\n\"I'm so full of 'em I can hardly stick,\" he assented gloomily. \"I don't\ndrink or smoke or swear or play pool or cards, and on Sundays I go to\nchurch.\"\n\nI laughed outright. \"You've come to the right place for such exemplary\nvirtues to be fully appreciated, Mr. Duncan.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said with a return of his indignation, \"but it\nwasn't in the bargain that I should starve to death. Do you realise,\nMr. Littlejohn,\" he continued, warming, \"that you behold in me a young\nman in the prime of health actually on the point of wasting visibly\naway to a shadow of my former hardy self? It's a fact: I am. For the\npast two days I've had nothing to eat except railway sandwiches and\ncoffee and the kind of fodder they pitchfork you at the Bigelow House.\nAnd I came here with a mind coloured with rosy anticipations of real\nold-fashioned country cooking. It's an outrage!\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said I: \"why not come home with me for dinner? I'll be\nglad to have you, and Miss Carpenter won't mind your coming, I'm sure.\"\n\nHe got up with alacrity. \"Those are the first human words I've heard in\nRadville, sir! I accept with joy and gratitude. Come--lead me to it!\"\n\nNow, Miss Carpenter doesn't like her meals delayed; so I would have\nbeen inclined to hasten this Mr. Duncan; but he saved me the trouble.\n\n\"Miss Carpenter?\" he asked without warning, as we hurried up Main\nStreet.\n\n\"My landlady, Mr. Duncan.\"\n\n\"She takes boarders? An old maid?\" he persisted eagerly.\n\n\"An elderly spinster; boarders are her distraction as well as a source\nof income.\"\n\n\"Do you think she'd take me in, Mr. Littlejohn?\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it. There's a vacant room ...\"\n\n\"Does she talk?\"\n\n\"Moderately.\"\n\n\"Not a regular walking newspaper--no?\"\n\n\"Not exactly--\"\n\n\"Then I'm afraid it's no use,\" he sighed.\n\nI glanced up at his face, but it was inscrutable.\n\n\"You--you want a landlady who talks?\" I gasped, incredulous.\n\n\"It's one of the rules,\" he said, again obscurely.\n\nI could make nothing of him. And had I any right to introduce to Hetty\nCarpenter a guest who came without credentials and talked more or less\nlike a lunatic at large?\n\n\"Mr. Duncan--\" I began, uncomfortable.\n\n\"Don't say it,\" he anticipated me. \"I know you think I'm crazy--but I'm\nnot. You would think so, naturally, because you're the only man here\nwho's ever lived away from Radville long enough--not counting those who\nwent to the World's Fair--.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Bigelow told me last night; said you'd be glad to meet somebody from\nNew York. I hope he's right. I'm glad, personally.... You see--May I\nrequest that you regard this as confidential?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes!\"\n\n\"I've come to Radville to make my fortune.\"\n\nThe confession smote me witless: I could only gape. He nodded\nconfirmation, with a most serious mien. At length I found strength to\narticulate. \"From New York--?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's a new scheme. You see, Mr. Littlejohn,\nmatters have come to such a state that a city-bred boy practically\ndoesn't stand any show on earth of making good in the cities; your\ncountry-bred boys crowd him to the wall, nine times out of ten. They\ninvade us in hordes, fresh from the open, strong, vigorous,\nclear-headed, ambitious.... What chance have we got? ... I've been\nfiguring it out, you see, and I've come to the conclusion that it's my\nonly salvation to get back to the country and improve some of the\nopportunities--the golden opportunities--that your boys have neglected,\noverlooked, in their mad desire to invade the commercial centres of the\ncountry.\"\n\nHe seemed very much in earnest; I was watching him as closely as I\nmight without making my scrutiny offensive; and there seemed to be the\nring of conviction in his voice, while the expression of his eyes\nindicated concentrated thought. And how was I to know, then, that the\nconcentration was due to the necessity of invention?\n\n\"You follow me, Mr. Littlejohn?\"\n\n\"I was here first,\" I corrected. \"Still, there's more in what you say\nthan perhaps you realise.\"\n\n\"If I'd made this discovery originally I'd agree with you, sir. But,\nquite to the contrary, it was pointed out to me by one of the shrewdest\nbusiness minds in the United States--a man who'd been a country boy to\nbegin with. And I've come to the conclusion that he's right.\"\n\n\"So you're here.\"\n\n\"Here I am.\"\n\n\"And what do you propose doing?\"\n\n\"I'm reading law, Mr. Littlejohn; that I shall continue. In the\nmeantime, I shall keep my eyes open. At any day, at any amount, the\nopportunity may present itself, the opportunity I'm looking for.\"\n\n\"Probably you're right,\" I assented, impressed, as we turned a corner.\n\nA young woman in a very attractive linen gown was strolling toward us,\nquite prettily engaged with a book which she read as she walked, her\nfair young head bowed beneath a sunshade which tinted her face\nbecomingly. She gave me a shy smile and a low-voiced greeting as we\npassed. Only my knowledge of the young woman prevented me from being\nblinded by her engaging appearance.\n\n\"That,\" said I, when we were out of earshot, \"shows you what a furore a\ngood-looking young man can create in a town like this. Josie Lockwood\nhas put on her best bib-and-tucker to go walking in this afternoon, on\nthe off-chance of meeting you, Mr. Duncan.\"\n\n\"Flattery note,\" he commented. \"Who's Josie Lockwood?\"\n\n\"Daughter of Blinky Lockwood, the richest man in Radville.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said cryptically.\n\nWe had come to Miss Carpenter's. I opened the gate for him, but he\nstood aside, refusing to precede me. And courtesy in the young folk of\nto-day warms my old heart.\n\nHe had as much for Hetty Carpenter. Within an hour he had insinuated\nhimself into her good graces with a deftness, an ease, that astounded.\nWithin three hours he was established, bag and baggage, in her very\nbest room.\n\nAnd thirty minutes after she had helped Duncan unpack, Hetty had to run\ndowntown to buy a spool of thread.\n\n\nVII\n\n\nA WINDOW IN RADVILLE\n\nA jealous secret, which has never heretofore been divulged, is\nresponsible for the prosperity of the Radville _Citizen_--at\nleast, in very great measure. As the discoverer of this recipe for\ncirculation, I have kept it carefully locked in my guilty bosom for\nmany a year, and if I now betray it I do so without scruple, for the\n_Gazette_ is now established firmly in a groove of popularity from\nwhich you'd find it hard to oust the paper. So here's letting the cat\nout of the bag:\n\nThe policy of the _Citizen_ has long been to devote its columns\nmainly to the exploitation of what is known in newspaper terminology as\n\"the local story.\" Of the news of the great outside world we're\nparsimonious, recognising the fact that the coronation of King Edward\nVII. is a matter of much less import to our community than the\nholocaust which was responsible for the destruction of Sir\nHigginbottom's new hen-house. Similarly a West Indian tornado involving\nlosses running up into hundreds of thousands of dollars sinks into\nrelative insignificance as compared with the local weather forecast and\nits probable effect on crops not worth ten thousand; while the enforced\nabdication of the Sultan of Turkey gets a \"stick\" (a space in a\nnewspaper column about as long as your forefinger, if you have a small\nhand) as contrasted with the column and a half assigned to the death of\nold Colonel Bohun.\n\nNow, naturally, a paper in a small country town can't afford a large\nand hustling staff of enthusiastic reporters; and very probably the\n_Citizen_ would overlook many items and stories of burning local\ninterest were it not for the fact that the population has been\ncunningly made to serve in a reportorial capacity without either pay or\nits own knowledge. We literally get our local news by wireless; and\nfrom dawn to dark there's a constant supply of it on tap.\n\nIt's this way: our editorial rooms are in the second storey of a\nbuilding overlooking Court House Square. The lower floor is occupied by\nthe Post Office, and in front of the Post Office are a hitching-post\nand two long, weather-scarred benches, while just across the road--I\nmean street--on the boundary of the square proper--is a near-bronze\ndrinking-fountain and watering-trough erected from the proceeds of\nseveral fairs given by the local branch of the W. C. T. U. Naturally,\nindeed inevitably, all Radville gravitates to the Post Office, bringing\nthe news with it, and stops to discuss it on the steps or the benches\nor by the fountain; and the acoustics are admirable. With a window open\nand scratch-pad handy, the keen-eared scribe at his desk in our offices\ncan hardly fail to pick up every scrap of town information between\nsunrise and dusk.... Of course, in winter the supply's not so good.\nWinter before last we all suffered with colds acquired through keeping\nthe windows open; and last winter our circulation fell off surprisingly\nthrough keeping them closed. This winter we contemplate cutting a\ntrap-door through the floor for the ostensible purpose of ventilation.\n\nAnd thus it was that I managed to hear much of Mr. Duncan while I\nmyself was engaged in formulating an estimate of the young man. He\nengaged the popular imagination no less than mine own, although I was\nmore intimately associated with him--as a fellow-resident at Hetty\nCarpenter's. My professional duties making their habitual demands upon\nmy time, I saw, it may be, less of him than many of our people.\nCertainly I learned less of his ways from first-hand knowledge. But\nfrom my desk (it's the nearest to the window right above the Post\nOffice door) I was enabled to keep a pretty close line upon his habits\nand movements, during the first fortnight of his stay in Radville.\n\nAt home I saw him with unvarying regularity at meal-times and less\nfrequently after supper. Between whiles he seemed to observe a fairly\nregular routine: in the morning, after breakfast, he walked abroad for\nhis health's sake; in the afternoon and evening he sequestered himself\nin his room for the pursuit of his legal studies. About the genuineness\nof these latter I was long without a question: having been privileged\nto inspect his room I found it redolent of an atmosphere of highly\ncommendable application. His writing table was a model of neatness, and\nhis store of legal treatises impressed one vastly. That no one, not\neven Hetty Carpenter, ever saw the room without remarking the open\nvolume of \"The Law of Torts,\" with its numerous pages painstakingly\nspaced by slips of paper by way of bookmarks, is an attested fact. That\nit was always the same volume is less widely known.\n\nLess directly (that is to say, via my window) I learned of him\ncompendiously from sources which would have been anonymous but for my\nlong acquaintance with the voices of the townspeople.... I write these\npages at my desk at home and, if truth's to be told, somewhat\nsurreptitiously; but with these voices ringing in my memory's ear I\nseem still to be sitting at my erstwhile desk by the window, looking\nout over Court House Square, chewing the rubber heel of my pencil the\nwhile I listen. It's summer weather and there's a smell in the air of\ndust and heat; the square simmers and shimmers in unclouded sunshine,\nits many green plots of grass a trifle grey and haggard with dust, the\nflagstaff with its two flanking cannon by the bandstand in the middle\nwavering slightly in the haze of heat; there are two rigs, a farm-wagon\nand a buckboard, hitched to the post below, and some boys are squirting\nwater on one another by holding their hands over the lips of the\nfountain across the way. Immediately opposite, on the far side of the\nsquare, the Court House rises proudly in all the majesty of its\ncolumned front and clapboarded sides; farther along there's the\nMethodist Church, very severe, with its rows of sheds to one side for\nthe teams of the more rural members. Behind them all bulk our hills,\ndim and purple against the overwhelming blue of the sky. It's very\nquiet: there are few sounds, and those few most familiar: the raucous\nwar-cry of a rooster somewhere on the outskirts of town; an\nintermittent thudding of hoofs in the inch-deep dust of the roadway;\nMiles Stetson wringing faint but genuine shrieks of agony from his\ncornet, in a room behind the Opery House on the next street;\nperiodically a shuffle of feet on the sidewalk below; less frequently\nthe whine of the swinging doors at Schwartz's place; above it all,\nperhaps, the shrill but not unpleasant accents of Angie Tuthill as she\npauses on the threshold downstairs and injects surprising information\ninto the nothing-reluctant ears of Mame Garrison.\n\n\" ..."}

{"ID": 1187, "text": "The visitor, without revealing his name, departed in mysterious gloom,\nas he came. Again the stranger called and solemnly reminded Mozart of his promise. The composer\neasily persuaded himself that this was a visitor from the other world, and that the requiem\nwould be his own; for he was exhausted with labor and sickness, and easily became the prey\nof superstitious fancies. When his wife returned, she found him with a fatal pallor on his\nface, silent and melancholy, laboring with intense absorption on the funereal mass. He would\nsit brooding over the score till he swooned away in his chair, and only come to consciousness\nto bend his waning energies again to their ghastly work. The mysterious visitor, whom Mozart\nbelieved to be the precursor of his death, we now know to have been Count Walseck, who had\nrecently lost his wife, and wished a musical memorial.\n\nHis final sickness attacked the composer while laboring at the requiem. The musical world was\nringing with the fame of his last opera. To the dying man was brought the offer of the rich\nappointment of organist of St. Stephen's Cathedral. Most flattering propositions were made\nhim by eager managers, who had become thoroughly awake to his genius when it was too late.\nThe great Mozart was dying in the very prime of his youth and his powers, when success was\nin his grasp and the world opening wide its arms to welcome his glorious gifts with substantial\nrecognition; but all too late; for he was doomed to die in his spring-tide, though \"a spring\nmellow with all the fruits of autumn.\"\n\nThe unfinished requiem lay on the bed, and his last efforts were to imitate some peculiar instrumental\neffects, as he breathed out his life in the arms of his wife and his friend S\u00fcssmaier.\n\nThe epilogue to this life-drama is one of the saddest in the history of art: a pauper funeral\nfor one of the world's greatest geniuses. \"It was late one winter afternoon,\" says an old record,\n\"before the coffin was deposited on the side aisles on the south side of St. Stephen's. Van\nSwieten, Salieri, S\u00fcssmaier, and two unknown musicians were the only persons present besides\nthe officiating priest and the pall-bearers. It was a terribly inclement day; rain and sleet\ncame down fast; and an eye-witness describes how the little band of mourners stood shivering\nin the blast, with their umbrellas up, round the hearse, as it left the door of the church.\nIt was then far on in the dark cold December afternoon, and the evening was fast closing in\nbefore the solitary hearse had passed the Stubenthor, and reached the distant graveyard of\nSt. Marx, in which, among the 'third class,' the great composer of the 'G minor Symphony' and\nthe 'Requiem' found his resting-place. By this time the weather had proved too much for all\nthe mourners; they had dropped off one by one, and Mozart's body was accompanied only by the\ndriver of the carriage."}

Would it not be better to tell Prudence to go and keep\nher company?\"\n\nAs always, the father made certain objections which were not listened\nto. Prudence insisted, and soon mother and daughter went together to\nthe new pavilion, and approached the bed, the curtains of which were\ndrawn shut.\n\n\"Here is your sister-in-law come to spend the night with you....\"\n\nYu-lang did not know what to say. He was afraid of being discovered,\nand held the curtains very tightly under his chin, as he put his head\nthrough the opening.\n\n\"I am accustomed to be alone,\" he stammered.

{"ID": 1231, "text": "This secret was secured by\nLincoln through his habit of mastering whatever he heard in conversation or reading. \"When\na mere child,\" says Lincoln, \"I used to get irritated when anybody talked to me in a way I\ncould not understand. I don't think I ever got angry at anything else in my life. But that\nalways disturbed my temper, and has ever since. I can remember going to my little bedroom,\nafter hearing the neighbors talk of an evening with my father, and spending no small part of\nthe night walking up and down, trying to make out what was the exact meaning of some of their,\nto me, dark sayings. I could not sleep, though I often tried to, when I got on such a hunt\nafter an idea, until I had caught it, and when I thought I had got it, I was not satisfied\nuntil I had repeated it over and over; until I had put it in language plain enough, as I thought,\nfor any boy I knew to comprehend. This was a kind of passion with me, and it has stuck by me;\nfor I am never easy now when I am handling a thought until I have bounded it north, and bounded\nit south, and bounded it east, and bounded it west.\" And so to enter into what one reads, means\nthat he will master the thought. The most that a university can do for one is to teach him\nto read. Who has learned how to read has secured a liberal education, however or wherever he\nmay have learned it.\n\nThen, one should learn to scan an author. This means to take a rapid observation of his thoughts.\nMuch of one's common reading matter should be scanned. All local news, much magazine literature,\nand many books should be used in this way. It is mental sloth and waste of time to pore over\na newspaper or a book of light fiction, as one would a philosophy of history or a work of science.\nAs Bacon aptly puts it, \"Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few\nto be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read,\nbut not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention. Some books\nalso may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others.\" One's mind is like a horse,\nit soon learns its master. Feed it well, groom it well, treat it gently, you may expect much\nfrom it. It is reported of Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis that he has read a book a day for over\ntwenty years. He has learned to squeeze the thought out of a book at a grasp, as one of us\nwould squeeze the juice from an orange. Take a glimpse into his library. Five hundred volumes\nof sociological literature, four hundred volumes of history, two hundred of cyclopedias, gazetteers,\nbooks of reference; four hundred volumes of pure science, one hundred volumes of travels, two\nhundred and fifty volumes of biography; one hundred volumes of art and art history; a section\non psychology, ethics, philosophy, and the relation between science and religion, and a thousand\nvolumes of literature, pure and simple.\n\nWHEN TO READ.\n\nFirst, read at regular hours. This is for those who follow literary pursuits. No professional\nperson should respect himself in his work who has no special time for reading and study, and\nwho does not conscientiously adhere to it. The pulpit, the law-office, the doctor's office,\nthe teacher, and the editor's desk, each clamors for the man, the woman, who can think. To\nappreciate God and to sympathize with the human heart; to know law and the intricate special\ncase; to understand disease and relief for the suffering patient; to have something to teach\nand to know how to teach it even to the dullest pupil; to know human character and to be able\nto enlighten the public mind and the public conscience; all this requires in the one who serves\na deep and growing knowledge and experience which may be realized only in the grasp of truth\ncontained in the up-to-date and best authorized books. The use of books with this class of\npersons is not optional. They must buy and master them, or a few years at longest will relegate\nthem with their old books and ideas to the dusty garret where they belong.\n\nThen, many must read on economized time. The farmer, the mechanic, the merchant, the shopkeeper,\neach may find a little time for daily reading. Ten minutes saved in the morning, ten minutes\nin the afternoon, and ten minutes in the evening, this is half hour a day. In a week this gives\none three hours and a half, in a month fourteen hours of solid reading, and in a year one will\nhave read seven days of twenty-four hours each. Think of what may be accomplished in an average\nlifetime in common reading by the busiest person, who really wants to read. \"Schliemann,\" the\nnoted German scholar and author, \"as a boy, standing in line at the post-office waiting his\nturn for the mail, utilized the time by studying Greek from a little pocket grammar.\" \"Mary\nSomerfield, the astronomer, while busy with her children in the nursery, wrote her 'Mechanism\nof the Heavens,' without neglecting her duties as a mother.\" \"Julius Caesar, while a military\nofficer and politician found time to write his Commentaries known throughout the world.\" William\nCobbett says: \"I learned grammar when I was a private soldier on a six-pence a day. The edge\nof my guard-bed was my seat to study in, my knapsack was my bookcase, and a board lying on\nmy lap was my desk. I had no moment at that time that I could call my own; and I had to read\nand write among the talking, singing, whistling, and bawling of at least half a score of the\nmost thoughtless of men.\" Among those whom we all know who have risen out of obscurity to eminence\nthrough a wise economy of time which they have used in reading and study, are, Patrick Henry,\nBenjamin West, Eli Whitney, James Watt, Richard Baxter, Roger Sherman, Sir Isaac Newton, and\nBenjamin Franklin.\n\nVII. SOCIAL RECREATION.\n\nDEFINED.\n\nThe normal young person who does not dissipate is bursting with life. The natural child is\nactivity embodied. The healthful old person craves exercise. Life, activity, exercise, each\nmust have some method of spending itself. Some normal method, some right method, some attractive\nmethod must be chosen. By normal method we mean that which calls into use the varied faculties\nand powers of the entire being, body, mind, and heart. By right method we mean that which does\nnot crush out a part of one's being, while another part is being developed. By attractive method\nin the use of life, activity, exercise, we mean that which appeals to one's peculiar desires,\ntastes, and circumstances, so long as these are normal and right. Some chosen profession, trade,\nor work is the rightful heritage of every person. Each man, woman, and child should know when\nhe gets up of a morning, what his work is for that day. Consciously, or unconsciously, he should\nhave some outline of work, some end in view, some goal toward which he is stretching himself.\nDr. J. M. Buckley asks: \"Have you a purpose and a plan?\" And answers, \"Life is worth nothing\ntill then.\" The child is in the hands of his parent, his teacher, his guardian. These must\nanswer to Destiny for his beginning and growth. \"Satan finds something for idle hands to do.\"\nHence the necessity of vigilance on the part of those who hold the young. But \"all work and\nno play, makes Jack a dull boy.\" This rule is good whether \"Jack\" be a puny girl, a feeble\ngrandfather, a hustling, responsible father, a busy mother, or even a mischievous lad. Every\nperson who rises each morning, dresses himself and goes about his work as if he knew what he\nwere about; who has some useful work to do, and does it, sooner or later, needs rest. True,\nnight comes and one may rest. And sweet is the rest of sleep; a third of one's life is passed\nin this way. Sancho Panza has it right when he says:\n\n\"Now blessing light on him that first invented sleep! It covers a man all over, thoughts and\nall, like a cloak; it is meat for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, heat for the cold, and\ncold for the hot.\" But one craves a recreation, a rest which work nor sleep can give. Man has\na social nature, a longing to mingle with his acquaintances and friends. Let one be shut in\nwith work, or sickness, or weather, for whole days at a time, and see how hungry he gets to\nsee some one. A recreation at a social gathering literally makes a new being out of him. He\nis recreated. It is this form of recreation that we consider here, social recreation.\n\nA NECESSITY.\n\nSocial recreation is a necessity in a well-ordered life. As with many other common blessings\nwe forget its benefits. Nor are these benefits so evident until we see the blighting result\nin the life of the one who, for any reason whatsoever, has become a social recluse. We have\nknown a few persons who have once been in society, but who have allowed themselves to remain\naway from all sorts of gatherings, for a number of years. In every case, the result has been\nopenly noticeable. They have become boorish in manners, unsympathetic in nature, and suspicious\nin spirit. Thus they have grown out of harmony with the ideas and ways of those about them,\nhave come to take distorted and erroneous views of affairs and of men. Man is a composite being.\nMany factors enter into his make-up. He lives not only in the physical and intellectual, in\nthe religious and social, in a local and limited sense, but his life expands until it touches\nand molds many other characters and communities besides his own. In all of these spheres of\nhis influence and work on needs to be sobered down, corrected, stimulated. In no other way\nis this better accomplished than through one's very contact with his fellows in the religious\ngathering, among his workmen, in the political meeting, at the assembly, in the social gathering\nwhenever and wherever persons may see one another and talk over common interests.\n\nA SPECIFIC SENSE.\n\nIn a specific sense, by social recreation, we mean those pastimes and pleasures which all persons,\nexcept the social recluse, enjoy as they meet to spend an afternoon or an evening together.\nNow, how may we get the largest amount of pleasure, of rest, of recreation from such gatherings?\nHow may we best benefit ourselves, inspire one another, and in it all, honor God? It is no\nsmall task to accomplish these three ends in all things, in one's life. We have agreed that\nsome social practices are positively bad. And we have tried to show why the \"tobacco club,\"\nthe \"social glass,\" the \"card-party,\" the \"dancing-party,\" and the play-house reveries should\nbe avoided. We have left these forms of so-called \"questionable amusements\" out of our practice\nand let our of our lives. To what may we turn? Where may we go? We turn to the social gathering.\n\nBUT IT MUST BE PLANNED.\n\nNo social gathering can successfully run itself. See what forethought and expenditure are given\nto make successful the \"smoking-club,\" the \"wine-social,\" the \"card and dancing parties,\" and\nthe \"theater.\" Not one of these institutions thrive without thought and cost in their management.\nPut the same thought and expense into the gathering for social recreation, and you will find\nall of the merits of the questionable institution and none of its demerits. No company has\nlarger capabilities than the mixed company at the social gathering. Nor may any purpose be\nmore perfectly served than the purpose of true social recreation. Here we find those skilled\nin music, versed in literature, adept at conversation; we find the practical joker, the proficient\nat games, and last, but not least, those \"born to serve\" tables. This variety of genius, of\nwit, of skill, of willingness to serve, is laid at the altar of pleasure for the worthy purpose\nof making new again the weary body, the languishing spirit, the lonely heart. Let the right\nmanagement and stimulus be given to this resourceful company, and the hours will pass as moments,\nthe surest sign of a good time.\n\nSOME ESSENTIALS.\n\nDINING, SOCIAL HOUR, GAMES.\n\nNo social recreation is complete without dining. And yet the least important part of this meal\nshould be the taking of food. It is a serious fault with the modern social that too much attention\nis given to the variety and quantity of food, and not enough to merriment in taking it. To\nbe successful, the social company should gather as early as possible; the first hour-and-a-half\nshould be given to greetings and to social levity of the brightest and wittiest sort. If one\nhas an ache or a pain, a care or a loss, let it be forgotten now. It is weakness and folly\ncontinually to be under any burden. Here every one should take a genuine release from seriousness\nand earnestness in weighty and responsible affairs. Let all, except the serving committee for\nthis evening, take part in this strictly social hour-and-a-half. When the late-comers have\narrived and have been introduced, and the people have moved about and met one another, almost\nbefore the company are aware of it they are invited by the serving committee to dine. Usually\nall may not be served at once. Now that the company has been thinned out, the older persons\nhaving gone to the tables, short, spirited games should be introduced in which every person\nnot at luncheon, should be given a place and a part. At this juncture it is not best to introduce\nsitting-games, such as checkers, authors, caroms, or flinch, for the contestants might be called\nto take refreshments at a critical moment in the contest. With a little attention to it, appropriate\ngames may be introduced here that need not interfere with luncheon. Fully half an hour should\nbe spent at each set of tables, where at the close of the meal, some humorous subject or subjects\nshould be introduced and responded to be those best fitted for such a task. Almost any person\ncan say something bright as well as sensible, if he will give a little attention to it beforehand.\nWhile the second and third tables are being served, let those retiring contest at games of\nskill, converse, or take up other appropriate entertainment directed by the everywhere present\nentertainment committee. By this time half-past ten or eleven o'clock, some who are old, or\nwho have pressing duties on the next day may want to retire. If the serving committee have\nbeen skillful in adjusting the time spent at each table to the number of tables, etc., by eleven\no'clock the serving shall have been completed. Now, the young in spirit, whether old or young,\nexpect, and should have an hour at the newest, liveliest, and most recreative games. No part\nof the evening entertainment should be allowed to drag. To insure this a frequent change of\nsocial games is needed.\n\nAVOID LATE HOURS.\n\nAs late hours tend to produce irregularity in sleep, in meals, and in work; and since the object\nof the social is recreation, the company should retire about midnight. Oftentimes people stay\nand stay at such a gathering, until the hostess, the entertaining committee, and the people\nthemselves are worn out. And yet, who is at fault? This is a critical point in the modern popular\nsocial. How shall the company disband in due season? In his \"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,\"\nOliver Wendell Holmes gives a suggestion on this point for the private visitor, who does not\nknow how to go. Says Holmes: \"Do n't you know how hard it is for some people to get out of\na room when their visit is really over? They want to be off, and you want to have them off,\nbut they do n't know how to manage it. One would think they had been built in your parlor or\nstudy and were waiting to be launched. I have contrived a sort of ceremonial inclined plane\nfor such visitors, which being lubricated with certain smooth phrases, I back them down, metaphorically\nspeaking, stern-foremost, into their 'native element,' the great ocean of outdoors.\" There\nare social companies as hard to get rid of as this. They want to go, and every one wants them\nto go, but just how to make the start, no one seems to know. Dr. Holmes and his \"inclined plane\"\nmay have been successful with the private caller, but who will be the \"contriver of a ceremonial,\"\none sufficient to land the social company into its \"native element, the great ocean of outdoors?\"\nNo, this most delicate of the problems involved in a successful modern social must be left\nto a tactful hint from the entertainment committee, and to the wise choice of a few recognized\nleaders in the company.\n\nNEW COMMITTEES.\n\nSpecial committees should have charge of the serving and of the entertainment. As far as possible\nthese should vary with each successive social. It is an erroneous notion, prevalent in nearly\nevery community, that only \"certain ones\" can do this or that; the consequence is that these\n\"certain ones\" do all the work, are deprived of the true rest and relief which the social is\nmeant to give, while others who should take their turn, grow unappreciative, and weak in their\nserving and entertaining ability.\n\nTHE AVERAGE SOCIAL A FAILURE.\n\nAs it is conducted to-day, the average social is a failure. Late at arriving, want of introductions,\nlack of arranged entertainment, late hours,--all go to weaken and to dull the average young\nperson in place of to cultivate his wits, his special genius at music, reading, and conversation,\nand to recreate him in body, mind, and spirit. To make a success of the social gathering some\none must keep in mind the personal convenience and happiness of every person present. When\nthis is done and the social gathering becomes notable for the real pleasure that it gives,\nthen we shall be able to drive out the \"questionable amusements,\" because we have taken nothing\nfrom the person, and have given him new life and interest.\n\nVIII. FRIENDSHIP.\n\nBONDS OF ATTACHMENT.\n\nEach person is connected with every other person by some bond of attachment. It may be by the\nsteel bond of brotherhood, by the silvern chain of religious fellowship, by the golden band\nof conjugal affection, by the flaxen cord of parental or filial love, or by the silken tie\nof friendship. One or more of these bonds of attachment may encircle each person, and each\nbond has its varying strength, and is capable of endless lengthening and contracting. Brotherhood\nis a general term, and as it is used here, comprises the fellow-feeling that one human being\nhas for another, this is universal brotherhood. Brotherhood comprises the fellow-feeling that\nattracts persons of the same race, nation, or community, this is racial, national, or community\nbrotherhood; also, it comprises the fellow-feeling that exists between persons of the same\navocation, calling, or work, this is the brotherhood of profession; it comprises the fellow-feeling\nthat joins persons of the same order or party, this is the brotherhood of order; it comprises\nthe fellow-feeling that joins brothers and sisters of the same home, this is the brotherhood\nof family. Religious fellowship includes that spiritual intercourse which is held between persons\nof the same religious faith and practice. Conjugal affection comprises that feeling of mind\nand heart which unites husband and wife. Filial and parental love exists between parent and\nchild. While friendship comprises that soul union which exists between persons because of similar\ndesires, tastes, and sentiments. Each of these bonds of attachment has its characteristic mark,\nits essential feature. The essential feature of universal brotherhood is common origin, present\nstruggle, and future hope; the essential feature of racial, national, or community brotherhood\nis patriotism; the essential feature of brotherhood of the order is mutual helpfulness; the\nessential feature in brotherhood of the profession is common pursuit; in brotherhood of the\nfamily, common parentage; in conjugal affection, attraction for opposite sex; in parental and\nfilial love, love of offspring and love of parent; while in friendship the essential feature\nis harmony of natures.\n\nWHAT IS FRIENDSHIP?\n\nNo human relationship can be more beautiful, nor more abiding than true friendship. It is a\nspiritual thing, a communion of souls, virtuously exercised. How one is impressed and pleased\nto see another horse just like his own, to see another dog exactly resembling his own, to meet\na person who speaks, looks, and acts like some one he has known. It is a surprise, mingled\nwith mystery and delight. But with what increased surprise and delight does one meet with a\n\"person after his own heart.\" All men have recognized the strength and beauty of right self-love."}

{"ID": 70, "text": " On the morrow all\nNuremberg would learn that Herr Casper had broken his son's betrothal pledge, because his bride,\nfor the sake of a tempter, Sir Heinz Schorlin, had failed to keep her troth with him.\n\nHow deeply all this pierced Eva's heart!  how terrible was the torture of the thought that\nshe was the cause of this frightful misfortune! Dissolved in an agony of tears, she entreated\nthe poor girl to forgive her; and Els did so willingly, and in a way that touched her father\nto the very depths of his heart.  How good the girls must be who, spite of the sore suffering\nwhich one had brought upon the other, were still so loving and loyal!\n\nConvinced that Eva, too, had done nothing worthy of punishment, he went towards them to clasp\nboth in his arms, but ere he could do so the clap of thunder which had frightened Katterle\nso terribly shook the whole room.  \"St. Clare, aid us!\" cried Eva, crossing herself and falling\nupon her knees; but Els rushed to the window, opened it, and looked down the street.  Nothing\nwas visible there save a faint red glow on the distant northern horizon, and two mailed soldiers\nwho were riding into the city at a rapid trot.  They had been sent from the stables in the\nMarienthurm to keep order in case a fire should break out.  Several men with hooks and poles\nfollowed, also hurrying to the Frauenthor.\n\nIn reply to the question where the fire was and where they going, they answered: \"To the Fischbach,\nto help.  Flames have burst out apparently under the fortress at the Thiergartenthor.\"\n\nThe long-drawn call for help from the warder's horn, which came at the same moment, proved\nthat the men were right.\n\nHerr Ernst hastened out of the room just as Katterle's shriek, \"The lightning struck! the convent\nis burning!\" rung from the upper step of the stairs.\n\nHe had already pronounced her sentence, and the sight of her roused his wrath again so vehemently\nthat, spite of the urgent peril, he shouted to her that, whatever claimed his attention now,\nshe certainly should not escape the most severe punishment for her shameful conduct.\n\nThen he ordered old Endres and two of the menservants to watch the sleeping-room of his invalid\nwife, that in case anything should happen the helpless woman might be instantly borne to a\nplace of safety.\n\nEre he himself went to the scene of the conflagration he hurried back to his daughters.\n\nWhile the girls were giving him his hat and cloak he told them where the fire had broken out,\nand this caused another detention of the anxious master of the house, for Eva seized her shoes\nand stockings and, kicking her little slippers from her feet, declared that she, too, would\nnot remain absent from the place when her dear nuns were in danger.  But her father commanded\nher to stay with her mother and sister, and went to the door, turning back once more on the\nthreshold to his daughters with the anxious entreaty: \"Think of your mother!\"\n\nAnother peal of thunder drowned the sound of his footsteps hurrying down the stairs.  When\nEls, who had watched her father from the window a short time, went back to her sister, Eva\ndried her eyes and cheeks, saying: \"Perhaps he is right; but whenever my heart urges me to\nobey any warm impulse, obstacles are put in my way.  What a weak nonentity is the daughter\nof an honourable Nuremberg family!\"\n\nEls heard this complaint with astonishment.  Was this her Eva, her \"little saint,\" who yesterday\nhad desired nothing more ardently than with humble obedience, far from the tumult of the world,\nto become worthy of her Heavenly Bridegroom, and in the quiet peace of the convent raise her\nsoul to God?  What had so changed the girl in these few hours?  Even the most worldly-minded\nof her friends would have taken such an impeachment ill.\n\nBut she had no time now to appeal to the conscience of her misguided sister.  Love and duty\nsummoned her to her mother's couch.  And then! The child had become aware of her love, and\nwas she, Els, who had been parted from Wolff by her own father, and yet did not mean to give\nhim up, justified in advising her sister to cast aside her love and the hope of future happiness\nwith and through the man to whom she had given her heart?\n\nWhat miracles love wrought!  If in a single night it had transformed the devout future Bride\nof Heaven into an ardently loving woman, it could accomplish the impossible for her also.\n\nWhile Eva was gazing out of the window Els returned to her mother.  She was still asleep and,\nwithout permitting either curiosity or longing to divert her from her duty, Els kept her place\nbeside the couch of the beloved invalid, spite of the fire alarm which, though somewhat subdued,\nwas heard in the room.\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nEva was standing at the open window.  The violence of the storm seemed exhausted.  The clouds\nwere rolling northward, and the thunder followed the flashes of lightning at longer and longer\nintervals.  Peace was restored to the heavens, but the crowd and noise in the city and the\nstreet constantly increased.\n\nThe iron tongues of the alarm bells had never swung so violently, the warder's horn had never\nmade the air quiver with such resonant appeals for aid.\n\nNor did the metallic voices above call for help in vain, for while a roseate glow tinged the\nlinden in front of her window and the houses on the opposite side of the street with the hues\nof dawn, the crowds thronging from the Frauenthor to St. Klarengasse grew denser and denser.\n\nThe convent was not visible from her chamber, but the acrid odor of the smoke and the loud\nvoices which reached her ear from that direction proved that the fire was no trivial one. \nWhile she was seeking out the spot from which Heinz must have looked up to her window, the\nOrtlieb menservants, with some of the Montfort retainers, came out of the house with pails\nand ladders.\n\nA female figure glided into the dark street after them.  A black shawl concealed her head and\nthe upper part of her figure, and she held a bundle in her hand.\n\nIt must be Katterle.\n\nWhere was she going at this hour?  As she was carrying the package, she could scarcely intend\nto help in putting out the fire.  Was she stealing away from fear of punishment?  Poor thing!\nEven the maid was hurled into misfortune through her guilt.\n\nIt pierced her very heart.  But while she called to Katterle to stop her, something else, which\nengrossed her still more, diverted her attention-- the loud voice of Countess Cordula reached\nher from the street door. With whom was she talking?  Did the girl, who ventured upon so many\nthings which ill-beseemed a modest maiden, intend to join the men?  Eva forgot that she, too,\nwould have hurried to the nuns had not her father prevented it.  The countess was already standing\nin the courtyard.\n\nAfter Eva had given her a hasty glance she again looked for the maid, but Katterle had already\nvanished in the darkness.  This grieved her; she had neglected something which might have saved\nthe girl, to whom she was warmly attached, from some imprudent act.  But while attracted by\nthe strange appearance of the countess she had forgotten the other.\n\nCordula had probably just left her couch, for she wore only a plain dress tucked up very high,\nshort boots, which she probably used in hunting, and a shawl crossed over her bosom; another\nwas wound round her head in the fashion of the peasant women who brought their goods to market\non cold winter days.  No farmer's wife could be more simply clad, and yet--Eva was forced to\nadmit it--there was something aristocratic in her firm bearing.\n\nHer companions were her father's chaplain and the equerry who had grown grey in his service.\nBoth were trying to dissuade her.  The former pointed to a troop of women who were following\nthe chief of police and some city constables, and said warningly: \"Those are all wanton queans,\nwhom the law of this city compels to lend their aid in putting out fires. How would it beseem\nyour rank to join these who shame their sex---- No, no!  It would be said to-morrow that the\nornament of the house of Montfort had----\"\n\n\"That Countess Cordula had used her hands in extinguishing the fire,\" she interrupted with\ngay self-confidence.  \"Is there any disgrace in that? Must my noble birth debar me from being\nnumbered among those who help their neighbours so far as lies in their power?  If any good\nis accomplished here, those poor women yonder will make it no worse by their aid.  If people\nhere believe that they do, it will give me double pleasure to ennoble it by working with them.\nPutting out the flames will not degrade me, and will make the women better.  So, forward! \nSee how the fire is blazing yonder!  Help is needed there and, thank Heaven, I am no weakling.\nBesides, there are women who want assistance and, to women in peril, the most welcome aid is\nwoman's.\"\n\nThe old equerry, his eyes glittering with tears, nodded assent, and led the way into the street;\nbut the countess, instead of following instantly, glanced back for the page who was to carry\nthe bandages which she had learned to use among her retainers at home.  The agile boy did not\ndelay her long; but while his mistress was looking to see that he had forgotten nothing of\nimportance, he perceived at the window Eva, whose beauty had long since fired his young heart,\nand cast a languishing glance at her.  Then Cordula also noticed her and called a pleasant\ngreeting.  Eva was on the point of answering in the same tone, when she remembered that Cordula\nhad spoken of Heinz Schorlin in the presence of others as if he were awaiting her in all submission.\nAnger surged hotly in her breast, and she drew back into the room as if she had not heard the\nsalutation.\n\nThe countess perceived it, and shrugged her shoulders pityingly.\n\nEva, dissatisfied with herself, continued to gaze down into the street long after the crowds\nof people flocking from the city had concealed Cordula from her eyes.  It seemed as though\nshe would never again succeed in anything that would bring contentment.  Never had she felt\nso weak, so ill-tempered, so devoid of self-reliance.  Yet she could not, as usual, seek consolation\nwith her saint.  There was so much here below to divert her attention.\n\nThe roseate glow on the linden had become a crimson glare, the flickering light on the opposite\nwalls a dazzling illumination.  The wind, now blowing from the west, bore from St. Klarengasse\nburning objects which scattered sparks around them--bundles of hay caught by the flames--from\nthe convent barn to the Marienthurm opposite, and into the street. Besides, the noise above\nand behind, before and below her, grew louder and louder.  The ringing of the bells and the\nblare of trumpets from the steeples continued, and with this constant ringing, pealing, and\ncrashing from above, mingled the high, clear voices of the choir of nuns in the convent, beseeching\nin fervent litanies the help of their patron saint. True, the singing was often drowned by\nthe noise from the street, for the fire marshals and quartermasters had been informed in time,\nand watchmen, soldiers in the pay of the city, men from the hospital, and the abandoned women\n(required by law to help put out the fires) came in little groups, while bailiffs and servants\nof the Council, barbers (who were obliged to lend their aid, but whose surgical skill could\nfind little employment here), members of the Council, priests and monks arrived singly.  The\nstreet also echoed with the trampling of many steeds, for mounted troopers in coats of mail\nfirst dashed by to aid the bailiffs in maintaining order, then the inspector of water works,\nwith his chief subordinate, trotted along to St. Klarengasse on the clumsy horses placed at\ntheir disposal by the Council in case of fire.  He was followed by the millers, with brass\nfire engines.  While their well-fed nags drew on sledges, with little noise, through the mire\nof the streets now softened by the rain, the heavy wooden water barrels needed in the work\nof extinguishing the flames, there was a loud rattling and clanking as the carts appeared on\nwhich the men from the Public Works building were bringing large and small ladders, hooks and\nlevers, pails and torches, to the scene of the conflagration.\n\nBesides those who were constrained by the law, many others desired to aid the popular Sisters\nof St. Clare and thereby earn a reward from God.  A brewer had furnished his powerful stallions\nto convey to the scene of action, with their tools, the eight masons whose duty it was to use\ntheir skill in extinguishing the flames.  All sorts of people--men and women-- followed, yelling\nand shrieking, to seek their own profit during the work of rescue.  But the bailiffs kept a\nsharp eye on them, and made way when the commander of the German knights, with several companions\non whose black mantles the white cross gleamed, appeared on horseback, and at last old Herr\nBerthold Vorchtel trotted up on his noble grey, which was known to the whole city.  He still\nhad a firm seat in the saddle, but his head was bowed, and whoever knew that only one hour\nbefore the corpse of his oldest son, slain in a duel, had been brought home, admired the aged\nmagistrate's strength of will.  As First Losunger and commander in chief he was the head of\nthe Council, and therefore of the city also.  Duty had commanded him to mount his steed, but\nhow pale and haggard was his shrewd face, usually so animated!\n\nJust in front of the Ortlieb mansion the commander of the German knights rode to his side,\nand Eva saw how warmly he shook him by the hand, as if he desired to show the old man very\ncordially his deep sympathy in some sore trouble which had assailed him.\n\nEver since Wolff's betrothal to Els had been announced the Vorchtels had ceased to be on terms\nof intimacy with the Ortliebs; but old Herr Berthold, though he himself had probably regarded\nyoung Eysvogel as his \"Ursel's\" future husband, had always treated Eva kindly, and she was\nnot mistaken--tears were glittering on his cheeks in the torchlight.  The sight touched the\nyoung girl's inmost heart.  How eagerly she desired to know what had befallen the Vorchtels,\nand to give the old man some token of sympathy!  What could have caused him so much sorrow?\nOnly a few hours before her father had returned from a gay entertainment at his house.  It\ncould scarcely concern Herr Berthold's wife, his daughter Ursula, or either of his two vigorous\nsons.  Perhaps death had only bereft him of some more distant, though beloved relative, yet\nsurely she would have known that, for the Ortliebs were connected by marriage both with the\nold gentleman and his wife.\n\nTortured by a presentiment of evil, Eva gazed after him, and also watched for Heinz Schorlin\namong the people in the street.  Must not anxiety for her bring him hither, if he learned how\nnear her house the fire was burning?\n\nWhenever a helmet or knight's baret appeared above the crowd she thought that he was coming.\nOnce she believed that she had certainly recognised him, for a tall young man of knightly bearing\nappeared, not mounted, but on foot, and stopped opposite to the Ortlieb house.  That must be\nhe! But when he looked up to her window, the reflection of the fire showed that the man who\nhad made her heart beat so quickly was indeed a young and handsome knight, but by no means\nthe person for whom she had mistaken him.  It was Boemund Altrosen, famed as victor in many\na tournament, who when a boy had often been at the house of her uncle, Herr Pfinzing. There\nwas no mistaking his coal-black, waving locks.  It was said that the dark-blue sleeve of a\nwoman's robe which he wore on his helmet in the jousts belonged to the Countess von Montfort.\nShe was his lady, for whom he had won so many victories.\n\nHeinz Schorlin had mentioned him at the ball as his friend, and told her that the gallant knight\nwould vainly strive to win the reckless countess. Perhaps he was now looking at the house so\nintently on Cordula's account. Or had Heinz, his friend, sent him to watch over her while he\nwas possibly detained by the Emperor?\n\nBut, no; he had just gone nearer to the house to question a man in the von Montfort livery,\nand the reply now led him to move on towards the convent.\n\nWere the tears which filled Eva's eyes caused by the smoke that poured from the fire more and\nmore densely into the street, or to disappointment and bitter anguish?\n\nThe danger which threatened her aunt and her beloved nuns also increased her excitement.  True,\nthe sisters themselves seemed to feel safe, for snatches of their singing were still audible\namid the ringing of the bells and the blare of the trumpets, but the fire must have been very\nhard to extinguish.  This was proved by the bright glow on the linden tree and the shouts of\ncommand which, though unintelligible, rose above every other sound.\n\nThe street below was becoming less crowded.  Most of those who had left their beds to render\naid had already reached the scene of the conflagration.  Only a few stragglers still passed\nthrough the open gate towards the Marienthurm.  Among them were horsemen, and Eva's heart again\nthrobbed more quickly, but only for a short time.  Heinz Schorlin was far taller than the man\nwho had again deceived her, and his way would hardly have been lighted by two mounted torch\nbearers.  Soon her rosy lips even parted in a smile, for the sturdy little man on the big,\nstrong-boned Vinzgau steed, whom she now saw distinctly, was her dearest relative, her godfather,\nthe kind, shrewd, imperial magistrate, Berthold Pfinzing, the husband of her father's sister,\ngood Aunt Christine.\n\nIf he looked up he would tell her about old Herr Vorchtel.  Nor did he ride past his darling's\nhouse without a glance at her window, and when he saw Eva beckon he ordered the servants to\nkeep back, and stopped behind the chains.\n\nAfter he had briefly greeted his niece and she had enquired what had befallen the Vorchtels,\nhe asked anxiously: \"Then you know nothing yet? And Els--has it been kept from her, too?\"\n\n\"What, in the name of all the saints?\"  asked Eva, with increasing alarm.\n\nThen Herr Pfinzing, who saw that the door of the house was open, asked her to come down.  Eva\nwas soon standing beside her godfather's big bay, and while patting the smooth neck of the\nsplendid animal he said hurriedly, in a low tone: \"It's fortunate that it happened so.  You\ncan break it gradually to your sister, child.  To-night  Summon up your courage, for there\nare things which even a man--To make the story short, then: Tonight Wolff Eysvogel and young\nVorchtel quarreled, or rather Ulrich irritated your Wolff so cruelly that he drew his sword--\"\n\n\"Wolff!\" shrieked Eva, whose hand had already dropped from the horse. \"Wolff!  He is so terribly\nstrong, and if he drew his sword in anger----\"\n\n\"He dealt his foe one powerful thrust,\" replied the imperial magistrate with an expressive\ngesture.  \"The sword pierced him through.  But I must go on  Only this one thing more: Ulrich\nwas borne back to his parents as a corpse.  And Wolff  Where is he hiding?  May the saints\nlong be the only ones who know!  A quarrel with such a result under the Emperor's eyes, now\nwhen peace has just been declared throughout the land!  Who knows what sentence will be pronounced\nif the bailiffs show themselves shrewder this time than usual!  My office compelled me to set\nthe pack upon him.  That is the reason I am so late.   Tell Els as cautiously as possible.\"\n\nHe bowed gallantly and trotted on, but Eva, as if hunted by enemies, rushed up the staircase,\nthrew herself on her knees before the prie dieu, and sobbed aloud.\n\nYoung Vorchtel had undoubtedly heard of the events in the entry, taunted Wolff with his betrothed\nbride's nocturnal interview with a knight, and thus roused the strong man to fury.  How terrible\nit all was!  How could she bear it!  Her thoughtlessness had cost a human life, robbed parents\nof their son!  Through her fault her sister's betrothed husband, whom she also loved, was in\ndanger of being placed under ban, perhaps even of being led to the executioner's block!\n\nShe had no thought of any other motive which might have induced the hot- blooded young men\nto cross swords and, firmly convinced that her luckless letter had drawn Heinz Schorlin to\nthe house and thus led to all these terrible things, she vainly struggled for composure.\n\nSometimes she beheld in imagination the despairing Els; sometimes the aged Vorchtels, grieving\nthemselves to death; sometimes Wolff, outlawed, hiding like a hunted deer in the recesses of\nthe forest; sometimes the maid, fleeing with her little bundle into the darkness of the night;\nsometimes the burning convent; and at intervals also Heinz Schorlin, as he knelt before her\nand raised his clasped hands with passionate entreaty.\n\nBut she repelled every thought of him as a sin, and even repressed the impulse to look out\ninto the street to seek him.  Her sole duty now was to pray to her patron saint and the Mother\nof God in behalf of her sister, whom she had hurled into misfortune, and her poor heart bleeding\nfrom such deep wounds; but the consolation which usually followed the mere uplifting of her\nsoul in prayer did not come, and it could not be otherwise, for amid her continual looking\ninto her own heart and listening to what went on around her no real devotion was possible.\n\nAlthough she constantly made fresh efforts to collect her thoughts, and continued to kneel\nwith clasped hands before the prie dieu, not a hoof- beat, not a single loud voice, escaped\nher ear.  Even the alternate deepening and paling of the reflection of the fire, which streamed\nthrough the window, attracted her attention, and the ringing of bells and braying of trumpets,\nwhich still continued, maintained the agitation in her soul.\n\nYet prayer was the sole atonement she could make for the wrong she had done her sister; so\nshe did not cease her endeavours to plead for her to the Great Helper above, but her efforts\nwere futile.  Yet even when she heard voices close by the house, among which she distinguished\nCountess Cordula's and--if she was not mistaken--her father's, she resisted the impulse to\nrise from her knees.\n\nAt last the vain struggle was ended by an interruption from without. After unusually loud voices\nexclaiming and questioning had reached her from the entry, the door of her chamber suddenly\nopened and old Martsche looked in.  The housekeeper was seeking something; but when she found\nthe devout child on her knees she did not wish to disturb her, and contented herself with the\nevidence of her eyes.  But Eva stopped her, and learned that she was searching for Katterle,\nwho could neither be found in her room, or anywhere else.  Herr Ortlieb had brought Countess\nvon Montfort home severely burned, and there were all sorts of things for the maid to do.\n\nEva clung shuddering to the back of the prie dieu, for the certainty that the unfortunate girl\nhad really fled was like strewing salt on her wounds.\n\nWhen Martsche left her and Els entered, her excitement had risen to such a pitch that she flung\nherself before her, as if frantic and, clinging to her knees, heaping self-accusations upon\nherself with passionate impetuosity, she pleaded, amid her sobs, for pardon and mercy.\n\nMeanwhile Els had been informed by her father of her lover's fatal deed, and as soon as she\nperceived what tortured her sister she relieved her, with loving words of explanation, from\nthe reproach of being the cause of this misfortune also, for the quarrel had taken place so\nearly that no tidings of the meeting in the entry could have reached young Vorchtel when he\nbecame involved in the fray with Wolff.\n\nNor was it solely to soothe Eva that she assured her that, deeply as she mourned the death\nof the hapless Ulrich and his parents' grief, Wolff's deed could not diminish either her love\nor her hope of becoming his."}

{"ID": 900, "text": "There the canvas-back duck, in a little\nflock, broke the Sabbath to dive for the wild celery that grows beneath\nthe sound. In yonder tree the bald eagle was starting out upon his\nAlgerine work of vehemence and piety, to intercept the hawk and steal\nhis cargo. The wild swan might be those faint, far birds flying so high\nover Kedge's Straits, in the south, and the black loon, spreading his\nwings like a demon, disappears close to the cat-boat, and rises no more\ntill memory has forgotten him.\n\nLevin Dennis steered close to a point where he had been wont to scatter\nfood for the black ducks, and draw them to the gunner's ambush.\nSheldrakes and goosanders, coots and gulls, whifflers and dippers, made\nthe best of Sunday, and bathed and wrote their winged penmanship on the\nwhite sheet of water.\n\nPoor Jack Wonnell returning, with something on his face between a grin\nand a tear, said:\n\n\"Levin, didn't I never harm nobody?\"\n\n\"Not as I ever heard about, Jack. They say you ain't got no sense, but\nyou never fight nobody. Everybody kin git along with you, Jack!\"\n\n\"No they can't, Levin. Meshach Milburn hates the ground I tread on. If\nhe know'd I was in love with little Roxy he'd marry her to a nigger.\"\n\n\"What makes him hate you so, Jack?\"\n\n\"Becaze I wears my bell-crowns, and he wears the steeple-top hat. He\nthinks I'm a-mockin' of him. Levin, I ain't got no other kind of hat to\nwear. Meshach Milburn needn't wear that air hat, but if I don't wear a\nbell-crown I must go bareheaded. I bought that lot of hats with the only\ndollar or two I ever had, as they say a fool an' his money is soon\nparted. The boys said they was dirt cheap. Now there wouldn't be nothin'\nto see wrong in my bell-crowns, ef all the people wasn't pintin' at ole\nMilburn's Entail Hat, as they call it. Why can't he, rich as a Jew, go\nbuy a new hat, or buy me one? I don't want to mock him. I'm afeard of\nhim! He looks at me with them loaded pistols of eyes an' it mos' makes\nme cry, becaze I ain't done nothin'. I'm as pore as them trash ducks,\"\npointing to a brace of dippers, which were of no value in the market,\n\"but I ain't got no malice.\"\n\n\"No, Jack. That trader could give you that bag of gold to keep and it\nwould be safe, becaze it wasn't your own.\"\n\n\"I 'spect I will have to go to the pore-house some day, Levin; my ole\naunt, who takes keer of me, can't live long, an' I ain't good fur\nnothin'. I can't git no jobs and I run arrands for everybody fur\nnothin', but the first money I git I'm gwyn to buy a new hat with. Ever\nsence I wore these bell-crowns Meshach hates me, an' I hope he's the\nonly man that does hate me, Levin. I don't think Meshach kin be a bad\nman.\"\n\n\"How kin he be good, Jack?\"\n\n\"Why, I have seen him in the woods when he didn't see me, calling up the\nbirds. Danged if they didn't come and git on him! Now birds ain't gwyn\nto hop on a man that's a devil, Levin. Do you believe he deals with the\ndevil?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Levin; \"I see sich quare things I believe in most anything\nquare. These yer tarrapins has got sense, and they're no more like it\nthan a stone. One night when we hadn't nothin' to eat at home, mother\nand me, an' she was a sittin' there with tears in her eyes wonderin'\nwhat we'd do next day, I ree-collected, Levin, that there was four\ntarrapins down in the cellar,--black tarrapin, that had been put there\nsix months before. I said to mother: 'I 'spect them ole tarrapins is\ndead an' starved, but I'll go see.'\n\n\"I found 'em under the wood-pile, an' they didn't smell nor nothin', so\nI took 'em all four up to mother an' put 'em on the kitchen table befo'\nthe fire, an' I devilled 'em every way to wake up, an' crawl, and show\nsome signs of life. No, they was stone dead!\n\n\"'Well, mother,' says I, 'put on your bilin' water an' we'll see if dead\ntarrapin is fit fur to eat!' She smiled through her cryin', and put the\nwater on, an' when it began to bubble in the pot, I lifted up one of\nthem tarrapins an' dropped him in the bilin' water, an' Jack, I'll be\ndog-goned if them other three tarrapins didn't run right off the table\nan' drop on to the flo' an' skeet for that cellar door!\n\n\"I caught 'em an' biled 'em, an' as we sat there eatin' stewed tarrapin\nwithout no salt, or sherry wine, or coffee, or even corn-bread, we heard\nsomethin' like paper scratchin' on the window, an' mother fell back and\nclasped her hands, an' said, 'There, do you hear the ghost?'\n\n\"I rushed to the door an' hopped into the yard, an' not a livin'\ncreature did I see; but there on the window-shelf was packages of salt,\ncoffee, tea, and flour, and a half a dollar in silver! I run back in the\nhouse, white as a ghost myself, an' I cried out, 'Mother, it's father's\nsperrit come again!'\n\n\"She made me git on my knees an' pray with her to give poor father's\nspirit comfort in his home or in heaven!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nSABBATH AND CANOE.\n\n\nThey now approached an island with low bluffs, on which appeared a\nconsiderable village, shining whitely amid the straight brown trunks of\na grove of pine-trees; but no people seemed moving about it, and they\nsaw but a single vessel at anchor in the thoroughfare or strait they\nsteered into--a canoe, which revealed on her bow, as they rounded to\nbeside her, a word neither Levin nor Jack could read, except by hearsay:\n_The Methodist_.\n\n\"Jack,\" said Levin, \"that was a big pine-tree the parson hewed his canoe\nouten. She fell like cannon, going off inter the swamp. She's a'most\nfive fathom long, an' a man can lie down acrost her. She's to carry the\nMethodis' preachers out to the islands.\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better wake _him_ up now?\" said Jack Wonnell; \"I 'spect you\nwant a drink, Levin?\"\n\n\"Yes; I got a thirst on me like fire,\" Levin exclaimed. \"I could do\nsomethin' wicked now, I 'spect, for a drink of that brandy.\"\n\nMooring against the shore, Levin went to his passenger, who was still in\ndeep sleep stretched upon the bare floor of the hold or cabin--a brawny,\nwiry man, with strong chin and long jaws, and his reddish, dark beard\nmatted with the blood that had spilled from his disfigured eye, and now\ndisguised nearly one half his face, and gave him a wild, bandit look.\n\n\"Cap'n! mister! boss! wake up! We have come to Deil's Island.\"\n\nThe long man, lying on his back, seemed unable to turn over upon his\nside, though he muttered in his stirred sleep such words as Levin could\nnot understand:\n\n\"The darbies, Patty! Make haste with them darbies! Put the nippers on\nher wrists an' twist 'em. Ha! the mort is dying. Well, to the garden\nwith her!\"\n\nAt this he awoke, and turned his cold, light eyes on Levin, and leaped\nto his feet.\n\n\"Did you hear me?\" he cried. \"It was only nums, kid, and jabber of a\nnazy man. Some day this sleep-talk will grow my neck-weed. Don't mind\nme, Levin! Come, lush and cock an organ with me, my bene cove!\"\n\n\"If you mean brandy,\" Levin said, \"I must have some or I'll jump out of\nmy skin. I feel like the man with the poker was a-comin'.\"\n\nJoe Johnson gave him the jug and held it up, and the boy drank like one\ndesperate.\n\n\"How the young jagger lushes his jockey,\" the tall man muttered. \"He's\nin Job's dock to-day. I'll take no more. A bloody fool I was all\nyesterday, an' oaring with my picture-frame. What place is this?\"\n\n\"Deil's Island, sir.\"\n\n\"Ha! so it is. 'Twas Devil's Island once, till the Methodies changed it\nfur politeness. This is the camp-meetin', then? Yer, Wonnell, take this\npiece of money, an' go to some house an' fetch us a bite of dinner.\nWe'll wait fur you.\"\n\nThe tall man led the way to the heart of the grove of pines, where the\nseeming town was found--a deserted religious encampment of durable\nwooden shells, or huts, in concentric circles of horseshoe shape, and at\nthe open end of the circle was the preaching-stand, a shed elevated\nabove the empty benches and pegs of removed benches, and which had a\nwide shelf running across the whole front for the preacher's Bible, and\nto receive his thwacks as he walked up and down his platform.\n\nIt looked a little mysterious now, with the many evidences of a large\nhuman occupation in the recent summer, to see this naked town and hollow\npulpit lying so suggestively under the long moan of the pine-trees,\nconferring together like dread angels in council, and expressing at\nevery rising breeze their impatience with the sins of men.\n\nAt times the great branches paused awhile, scarcely murmuring, as if\nthey were brooding on some question propounded in their council, or\nlistening to human witnesses below; and then they would gravely\nconverse, as the regular zephyrs moved in and out among them, and pause\nagain, as if their decision was almost dreaded by themselves. At\nintervals, a stern spirit in the pines would rise and thunder and shake\nthe shafts of the trees, and others would answer him, and patience would\nhave a season again. And so, with scarcely ever a silence that remained\nmore than a moment, this council went on all day, continued all night,\nwas resumed as the sun arose to comfort the world again, ceased not when\nthe rainbow hung out its perennial assurance upon the storm, and\ntypified to trembling worshippers the great synod of the Creator, in\neverlasting session, ready to smite the world with fire, but suspending\nsentence in the evergreen pity of God.\n\nIn one of the deserted shells, or \"tents,\" of pine, with neatly shingled\nroof, facing the preaching-booth, Joe Johnson and Levin Dennis found\nbenches, and, at the tall man's example, Levin also lighted a pipe, and\nlooked out between the escapes of smoke at Tangier Sound, deserted as\nthis camp-ground on the Sabbath, since the worshippers had reached home\nfrom church in their canoes. He thought of his lonely mother in the town\nof Princess Anne, wondering where he was, and of the Sundays fast\nspeeding by and bringing him to manhood, with no change in their\ncondition for the better, but penury and disappointment, a vague\nexpectation of the dead to return, and deeper intemperance of the dead\nman's son and widow's only hope. He would have cried out with a sense of\nmisery contagious from the music of those pines above him, perhaps, if\nthe brandy had not begun to creep along his veins and shine bold in his\nlarge, girlish eyes.\n\n\"Levin,\" said Joe Johnson, \"don't you like me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Johnson, I think I does, 'cept when you use them quare words I\ncan't understan'.\"\n\n\"I'm dead struck with you, Levin,\" Joe Johnson said. \"I want to fix you\nan' your mother comfortable. You're blood stock, an' ought to be stabled\non gold oats.\"\n\nHe drew the canvas bag of eagles and half-eagles out of his trousers,\nand held its mouth open for Levin to feast his eyes.\n\n\"Thar,\" said he, \"I told you, Levin, I was a-goin' to give you one of\nthem purties. I've changed my mind; I'm a-goin' to give you five of\n'em!\"\n\n\"My Lord!\" exclaimed Levin; \"that's twenty-five dollars, ain't it, sir?\"\n\n\"Oll korrect, Levin. Five of them finniffs makes a quarter of a hundred\ndollars--more posh, Levin, I 'spect, than ever you see.\"\n\n\"I never had but ten, sir, at a time, an' that I put in this boat, and\nJimmy Phoebus put ten to it, an' that paid for her.\"\n\n\"What a stingy pam he was to give you only ten!\" Joe Johnson exclaimed,\nwith disgust. \"Ain't I a better friend to ye? Yer, take the money\n_now_!\"\n\nHe pressed the gold pieces ostentatiously upon the boy, who looked at\nthem with fear, yet fascination.\n\n\"What am I to do to earn all this, Mr. Johnson?\"\n\n\"You comes with me fur a week,--you an' yer boat. I charters you at that\nfigger!\"\n\n\"But--mother?\"\n\n\"Well, when we discharge pigwidgeon, your friend with the bell\nshape--Jack Sheep yer--all you got to do, Levin, is to send the hard\ncole to your mother by him, sayin', 'Bless you, marm; my wages will\nexcoos my face!'\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, that will do. Mother will know by the money that I have got a\nlong job, and not be a 'spectin' of me. When do we sail, cap'n?\"\n\n\"How fur is it to Prencess Anne? What time to-night kin you make it?\"\n\nLevin stepped out of the shanty and looked at the wind and water, his\npulses all a-flutter between the strong brandy and the wonderful gold in\nhis pocket; and as he watched the veering of the pine-boughs to see\nwhich way they moved, their moaning seemed to be the voice of his\nwidowed mother by her kitchen fire that day, saying, \"He is in trouble.\nWhere is my son? Why stays he, O my Levin?\"\n\n\"The tide is on the stand, cap'n, an' will turn in half an hour. It will\ntake us up the Manokin with this wind by dark, ef we can get water\nenough in the thoroughfare without going around by Little Deil's.\"\n\nJohnson came out and made the same observations on wind and flood.\n\n\"I reckon it's eighteen miles to the head of deep water on Manokin,\nLevin?\"\n\n\"Not quite, sir, through the thoroughfare; it's nigh eighteen. We've got\nfour hours and a half of daylight yet.\"\n\n\"Then stand for the head of Manokin an' obey all my orders like a\n'listed man, an' I'll git ye and yer mother a plantation, an' stock it\nwith niggers for you. Come, brace up again!\"\n\nHe offered the brandy-jug, and encouraged the boy to drink heartily, and\naffected to do the same himself, though it was but a feint.\n\nWhile they stood in the shelter of the camp cottage going through this\npastime, a voice from near at hand resounded through the woods, and made\ntheir blood stop to circulate for an instant on the arrested heart.\n\nIt was a voice making a prayer at a high pitch, as if intended to cover\nall the camp-ground and be heard to the outermost bounds. The sincerity\nof the sound made Levin Dennis feel that the camp might still be\ninhabited by some spiritual congregation which the eyes of profane\nvisitors could not see--the remainder of the saints, the souls of the\nconverted, or an ethereal host from above the solemn organ of the pines.\n\nThe idea had scarcely seized upon him when a fluttering of wings was\nheard, and on the old camp-ground alighted a flock of white wild-geese.\n\nThey balanced their large deacon and elder-like bodies upon the empty\nseats, and there set up as grave a squawking as if they were singing a\nhymn, with that indifferent knowledge of harmony possessed by\ncamp-meeting choristers.\n\nThe accident of their coming--no unusual thing on these exposed\nislands--might have made untroubled people only laugh, but it produced\nthe contrary effect on both our visitors. Levin felt a superstitious\nfear seize upon him, and, turning to Joe Johnson, he saw that person\nwith a face so pale that it showed his blood-gathered eye yet darker and\nmore hideous, like a brand upon his countenance, gazing upon the late\nempty preaching-booth.\n\nThere Levin, turning his eyes, observed a solitary man kneeling, of a\nplain appearance and dress, and with locks of womanly hair falling\ncarelessly upon a large and almost noble forehead, his arms raised to\nheaven and his voice flowing out in a mellow stream of supplication, in\nthe intervals of which the geese could be heard quacking aloud and\npaddling their wings as they balanced and hopped over the camp-meeting\narena.\n\n\"Who's he a prayin' to?\" Levin asked of Joe Johnson.\n\n\"Quemar!\" muttered Johnson, as if he were terrified at something; \"his\npotato-trap is swallerin' ghosts! Curse on the swaddler? The kid will\nwhindle directly. Come, boy, come!\"\n\nAt this, seizing Levin's hand, partly in persuasion, partly as if he\nwanted the lad's protection, Johnson, fairly trembling, ran for the\nboat.\n\nLevin was frightened too; the more that he saw the stronger man's fear.\nAs they dashed across the camp-ground the wild-geese took alarm, and,\nsome running, some flying, scudded towards the Sound. A voice from the\npulpit cried after the retreating men, but only to increase their fears,\nand when they leaped on board the _Ellenora_, Joe Johnson was livid with\nterror. He ran partly down the companion-way and stopped to look back:\nthe wild-geese were now spreading their wings like a fleet of fleecy\nsails, and fluttering down the sound in gallant convoy.\n\n\"What did you run for?\" Levin said; \"the jug of brandy is left. It was\nonly Parson Thomas!\"\n\n\"You run first,\" the man replied, gasping for breath, and a little\nashamed. \"What did he preach at me fur?\"\n\n\"That's the parson of the islands,\" Levin said; \"he started Deil's\nIsland camp-meetin' last year, an' his favo-rite preacher dyin' jess as\nhe got it done, ole Pap Thomas, who lives yer, comes out to the\npreachin'-stand sometimes alone, an' has a cry and a prayer. The geese\nscared _me_, cap'n.\"\n\n\"Push off!\" ordered Joe Johnson; \"my teeth are most a-chatterin' with\nthe chill that mace cove give me.\"\n\nHe pulled up the anchor, hoisted the jib, and showed such nervous\napprehension that Levin subsided to managing the helm, and steered down\nthe thoroughfare, or strait, which, for some distance, wound around the\ncamp-meeting grove.\n\n\"Yer's Jack Wonnell comin' with the jug and the dinner. Sha'n't we wait\nfur him?\"\n\n\"He's got the kingdom-come cove with him! No; stop for nothing.\"\n\nBut the boat had to stop, as her keel scraped the mud in the almost dry\nthoroughfare, and a plain island man of benevolent, nearly credulous,\nface, hailed them, saying, stutteringly:\n\n\"Ne-ne-neighbors, do-don't be sc-scared that a-way. We ain't\nhe-eee-thens yer. Br-br-brother Wonnell's bringin' your taters and\npone.\"\n\n\"Come on, an' be damned to you?\" Johnson cried to Wonnell. \"What do we\nwant with this tolabon sauce?\"\n\n\"Sw-w-wear not a-a-at all!\" cried the parson of the islands. \"'Twon't\nl-l-lift ye over l-l-low tide, brother. Stay an' eat, an' t-t-talk a\nlittle with us. Why, I have seen that f-f-face before!\"\n\n\"Never in a gospel-ken before,\" the slave-dealer muttered, with an oath.\n\n\"B-but it can't be him,\" spoke the island parson, with solemnity. \"Ole\nEbenezer Johnson died s-s-several year ago.\"\n\n\"Who was he?\" cried the slave-dealer, with a little respectful interest.\n\n\"Ebenez-z-zer Johnson,\" Parson Thomas replied, with a mild and credulous\ncountenance, \"was the wickedest man on the Eastern Sho' for twenty year.\nP-pardon me, brother, fur a likin' ye to him, but somethin' in ye\ny-y-yur,\" passing his hand upon his skull, \"p-puts me in mind of him. It\nwas hyur he was shot\"--still keeping his hand upon the skull--\"through\nan' through, an' died the death of the sinner. I have p-p-put my\nf-finger through the two holes where the b-bullet come an' went, an' rid\nthis w-world of a d-d-demon!\"\n\nThe story appeared to have a fascination for the slave-buyer, Levin\nDennis thought, and Johnson exclaimed:\n\n\"Well, hod, did he ever run afoul of _you_?\"\n\n\"O y-y-yes,\" answered the genial island exhorter, with obliging\nloquacity; \"it was tw-w-enty-s-seven year ago that I see ole Eben-nezer\nJohnson come on the camp-ground of P-p-pungoteague with a mob of\np-p-pirates to break up the f-f-fust Methodies camp-meetin' ever held\nabout these sounds. He was en-c-couraged by ole King Custis, f-f-father\nof our Daniel Custis, of Prencess Anne, who was a b-b-big man fur the\nEstablish Church an' d-dispised the Methodies. It was a cowardly thing\nto do, but while King C-C-Custis laughed and talked a' durin' of the\np-p-preachin', Eb-b-b-benezer Johnson started a fight. The preacher\nc-c-cut his eye and saw who was a w-w-winkin' at the interference. He\nwas a l-l-lion of the L-l-lord, and bore the c-c-commission of Immanuel.\nHe knowed he was outen the s-s-state of Maryland and over in the\nV-v-vergeenia county of Ac-c-comack, an' that if the l-l-aws was a\nlittle more t-t-tolerant sence the Revolutionary war the ar-r-ristocracy\nthere was b-bitter as ever towards the people of the Lord. He t-t-urned\nfrom his preachin' at last, right on King Custis, an' he pinted his\nf-finger at him straight. The p-preacher was L-l-lorenzo Dow.\"\n\n\"Wheoo!\" Jack Wonnell exclaimed, with a coinciding grin; \"I've hearn of\nhim: a Yankee-faced feller, like a woman, with long braids an' curls of\nhair fallin' around of his breast an' back, and a ole straw hat, rain or\nshine.\"\n\n\"That was L-l-lorenzo Dow,\" the parson of the islands said. \"He turned\non K-k-king Custis and screamed, 'W-who art thou? The L-lord shall smite\nthee, w-whited sepulchre, and m-mock thee in thy ch-h-hildren's\nchildren, thou A-a-a-hab and thy J-j-jezebel!' It was King Custis's wife\nhe pinted at, too, the greatest lady and heiress in V-v-virgeenia.\nSh-h-e f-f-ainted in f-fear or r-rage to hear the prophecy and insult of\nher. Then, turning on Eb-b-benezer Johnson, Lorenzo Dow cried out, 'The\ndogs shall lie buried safer than his bones. Lay hold of him, brethren!'\nAnd s-something in Lorenzo Dow's t-trumpet-blast made every M-methodis'\na giant. They s-swept on Ebenezer Johnson, the bully of thr-ree states,\nan' beat him to the ground, an' raced his band to their boats, an' then\nthey th-hrew him into a little j-j-jail they had on the camp-ground,\nf-for safe keeping.\"\n\n\"What did King Custis do then, Pappy Thomas?\" asked Levin.\n\n\"Why, brethren, what did he do but use his f-f-family influence to g-git\nout a warrant for the preacher and his m-managers, on the ground of\nf-false imprisonment and s-slander! Lorenzo Dow got over into Maryland\ns-safe from the warrant, but our p-presiding elder was p-put in jail\ntill he could p-pay two thousand dollars fine. It almost beggared the\npoor Methodies of that day to raise so much money, but g-glory be to\nG-god! we can raise it now any day in the year, and in the next\ng-generation we can buy our p-persecutors.\"\n\n\"So Ebenezer Johnson, accordin' to the autum bawler's patter, got\npopped in the mazzard, my brother of the surplice? But he didn't climb\nno ladder, did he?\"\n\nThe stuttering host seemed not to comprehend this sneering exclamation,\nand Levin Dennis said:\n\n\"King Custis wasn't killed, was he, Pappy Thomas?\"\n\n\"It was his children's children his p-p-punishment was promised to,\" the\nisland parson said, \"and to the Lord a thousand y-years are but as\nd-days.\"\n\n\"The tide is fuller, Levin,\" Joe Johnson cried, \"your keel is clear. Now\npint her for Manokin. So bingavast, my benen cove, and may you chant all\nby yourself when I am gone!\"\n\n\"God bless the boys!\" the islander cried, \"an' k-keep them from the\nf-fire everlasting that is burning in your jug. And s-s-stranger,\nremember the end of Eb-b-benezer Johnson, an' repent!\"\n\nThe old man, barefooted, stoop-shouldered, stuttering, yet with a chord\nof natural rhetoric in his high fiddle-string of a windpipe, stood\nlooking after them till they passed down the thoroughfare under the\njib-sail, and Joe Johnson did not say a word till some marsh brush\nintervened between them, he being apparently under a remnant of that\npanic which had seized him on the camp-ground.\n\n\"That's a good man,\" Levin Dennis said, giving the tiller to Jack\nWonnell and raising the sail; \"he preached to the Britishers when they\nsailed from Tangiers Islands to take Baltimore, and told 'em they would\nbe beat an' their gineral killed. He's made the oystermen all round yer\njine the island churches an' keep Sunday. That stutterin' leaves him\nwhen he preaches, and when he leads the shout in meetin' it's piercin'\nas a horn.\"\n\n\"He's a bloody Romany rogue,\" Joe Johnson muttered, \"to tell me such a\ntale! But, kirjalis! he cursed not me!\"\n\n\"What language is that, Mr. Johnson? Is it Dutch or Porteygee?\"\n\n\"It's what we call the gypsy; some calls it the Quaker. It's convenient,\nLevin, when you go to Philadelfey, or Washinton, or New York, or some o'\nthem big cities, an' wants to talk to men of enterprise without the\nquails a-pipin' of you. Some day I'll larn it to you if you're a good\nboy.\"\n\nThey now sailed out of the thoroughfare into the broad mouth of the\nManokin, where a calm fell upon air and water for a little while, and\nthey could hear smothered music, as of drum-fish beneath the water,\nbeating, \"thum! thum!\" and crabs and alewives rose to the surface around\nthem, chased by the tailor-fish. The cat-boat drifted into the mouth of\na creek where rock and perch were running on the top of the water, and\nwith the tongs Jack Wonnell raised half a bushel of oysters in a few\ndips, and opened them for the party. Along the shores wild haws and wild\nplums still adhered to the bushes, and the stiff-branched\npersimmon-trees bore thousands of their tomato-like fruit. The\npartridges were chirping in the corn, the crow blackbirds held a funeral\nfeast around the fodder, some old-time bayside mansions stretched their\nlong sides and speckled negro quarters along the inlets, half hidden by\nthe nut-trees, and in the air soared the turkey-buzzard, like a\nvoluptuary politician, taking beauty from nothing but his lofty station.\n\n\"The ole Eastern Sho',\" Jack Wonnell said, with his animated vacancy,\n\"is jess stuffed with good things, Cap'n Johnsin. You kin fall ovaboard\nmost anywhair an' git a full meal. You kin catch a bucket of crabs with\na piece of a candle befo' breakfast, an' shoot a wild-duck mos' with\nyour eyes shet.\"\n\n\"This country's good for nothin',\" Joe Johnson said. \"Floredey is the\nland! Wot kin a nigger earn for yer? Corn, taters, melons: faugh!\nTobacco is a givin' out, cotton won't live yer. But Floredey is the\nhell-dorader of the yearth.\"\n\n\"What's the hell-dorader?\" asked Levin.\n\n\"That's Spanish or Porteygee for cheap niggers an' cotton,\" cried the\ntrader. \"Cotton's the bird!\"\n\n\"I thought cotton was a wool,\" Levin said.\n\n\"No, boy, cotton is a plant, growin' like a raspberry on a bush, havin'\npushed the blossoms off an' burst the pods below 'em, an' thar it is fur\nniggers to pick it. Thar's a Yankee in Georgey made a cotton-gin to gin\nit clean, an' now all the world wants some of it.\"\n\n\"Some of the gin?\" asked the irrelevant Wonnell.\n\n\"No, some of the cotton, Doctor Green! They can't git enough of it.\nEurip is crazy about it, but there ain't niggers enough to pick it all.\nSo I'm in the nigger trade an' tryin' to be useful to my country, an'\nwot does I git fur it? I git looked down on, an' a nigger's pertected\nfur a-topperin' of me! But never mind, I'll be a big skull yet, an' keep\nmy kerrige--in Floredey.\"\n\n\"What's Floredey good fur?\" Levin asked.\n\n\"It's full of nigger Injins, Simminoles, every one of 'em goin' to be\ncaught an' branded, an' put at cotton an' tobakker plantin', an' hog an'\ncow herdin'. More niggers will be run in from Cubey, an' all the free\nniggers in Delaware and up North will be sold, an' you an' me, Levin, is\ngwyn to own a drove of 'em an' have a orchard of oranges an' a thousand\nacres of cotton in bloom. We'll hold our heads up. Your mother shall be\nswitched to a nabob. My wife will be a shakester in diamonds. We'll\ndispise Cambridge an' Princess Anne, an' there sha'n't be a free nigger\nleft on the face of the earth. We'll swig to it!\"\n\nThe sick-headed yet fancy-ridden Levin drank again, and listened to the\ndealer's marvellous tales of golden fruit on coasts of indigo, and palms\nthat sheltered parrots calling to the wild deer."}

{"ID": 1436, "text": "Langdon, nor a patient by talking half an hour with him.\"\n\n\"Do you know much about the Veneer family?\"  said Mr. Bernard, in a natural way enough, the\nDoctor's talk having suggested the question.\n\nThe Doctor lifted his head with his accustomed movement, so as to command the young man through\nhis spectacles.\n\n\"I know all the families of this place and its neighborhood,\" he answered.\n\n\"We have the young lady studying with us at the Institute,\" said Mr. Bernard.\n\n\"I know it,\" the Doctor answered.  \"Is she a good scholar?\"\n\nAll this time the Doctor's eyes were fixed steadily on Mr. Bernard, looking through the glasses.\n\n\"She is a good scholar enough, but I don't know what to make of her. Sometimes I think she\nis a little out of her head.  Her father, I believe, is sensible enough;--what sort of a woman\nwas her mother, Doctor?--I suppose, of course, you remember all about her?\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew her mother.  She was a very lovely young woman.\"--The Doctor put his hand to his\nforehead and drew a long breath.--\"What is there you notice out of the way about Elsie Venner?\"\n\n\"A good many things,\" the master answered.  \"She shuns all the other girls.  She is getting\na strange influence over my fellow-teacher, a young lady,--you know Miss Helen Darley, perhaps?\nI am afraid this girl will kill her.  I never saw or heard of anything like it, in prose at\nleast;--do you remember much of Coleridge's Poems, Doctor?\"\n\nThe good old Doctor had to plead a negative.\n\n\"Well, no matter.  Elsie would have been burned for a witch in old times. I have seen the girl\nlook at Miss Darley when she had not the least idea of it, and all at once I would see her\ngrow pale and moist, and sigh, and move round uneasily, and turn towards Elsie, and perhaps\nget up and go to her, or else have slight spasmodic movements that looked like hysterics;--do\nyou believe in the evil eye, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Mr. Langdon,\" the Doctor said, solemnly, \"there are strange things about Elsie Veneer,--very\nstrange things.  This was what I wanted to speak to you about.  Let me advise you all to be\nvery patient with the girl, but also very careful.  Her love is not to be desired, and \"--he\nspoke in a lower tone--\"her hate is to be dreaded.  Do you think she has any special fancy\nfor anybody else in the school besides Miss Darley?\"\n\nMr. Bernard could not stand the old Doctor's spectacled eyes without betraying a little of\nthe feeling natural to a young man to whom a home question involving a possible sentiment is\nput suddenly.\n\n\"I have suspected,\" he said,--\"I have had a kind of feeling--that she--Well, come, Doctor,--I\ndon't know that there 's any use in disguising the matter,--I have thought Elsie Veneer had\nrather a fancy for somebody else,--I mean myself.\"\n\nThere was something so becoming in the blush with which the young man made this confession,\nand so manly, too, in the tone with which he spoke, so remote from any shallow vanity, such\nas young men who are incapable of love are apt to feel, when some loose tendril of a woman's\nfancy which a chance wind has blown against them twines about them for the want of anything\nbetter, that the old Doctor looked at him admiringly, and could not help thinking that it was\nno wonder any young girl should be pleased with him.\n\n\"You are a man of nerve, Mr. Langdon?\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"I thought so till very lately,\" he replied.  \"I am not easily frightened, but I don't know\nbut I might be bewitched or magnetized, or whatever it is when one is tied up and cannot move.\nI think I can find nerve enough, however, if there is any special use you want to put it to.\"\n\n\"Let me ask you one more question, Mr. Langdon.  Do you find yourself disposed to take a special\ninterest in Elsie,--to fall in love with her, in a word?  Pardon me, for I do not ask from\ncuriosity, but a much more serious motive.\"\n\n\"Elsie interests me,\" said the young man, \"interests me strangely. She has a wild flavor in\nher character which is wholly different from that of any human creature I ever saw.  She has\nmarks of genius, poetic or dramatic,--I hardly know which.  She read a passage from Keats's\n'Lamia' the other day, in the schoolroom, in such a way that I declare to you I thought some\nof the girls would faint or go into fits.  Miss Darley got up and left the room, trembling\nall over. Then, I pity her, she is so lonely.  The girls are afraid of her, and she seems to\nhave either a dislike or a fear of them.  They have all sorts of painful stories about her.\nThey give her a name which no human creature ought to bear.  They say she hides a mark on her\nneck by always wearing a necklace.  She is very graceful, you know, and they will have it that\nshe can twist herself into all sorts of shapes, or tie herself in a knot, if she wants to.\nThere is not one of them that will look her in the eyes.  I pity the poor girl; but, Doctor,\nI do not love her.  I would risk my life for her, if it would do her any good, but it would\nbe in cold blood.  If her hand touches mine, it is not a thrill of passion I feel running through\nme, but a very different emotion.  Oh, Doctor! there must be something in that creature's blood\nwhich has killed the humanity in her.  God only knows the cause that has blighted such a soul\nin so beautiful a body! No, Doctor, I do not love the girl.\"\n\n\"Mr. Langdon,\" said the Doctor, \"you are young, and I am old.  Let me talk to you with an old\nman's privilege, as an adviser.  You have come to this country-town without suspicion, and\nyou are moving in the midst of perils.  There are things which I must not tell you now; but\nI may warn you.  Keep your eyes open and your heart shut.  If, through pitying that girl, you\never come to love her, you are lost. If you deal carelessly with her, beware!  This is not\nall.  There are other eyes on you beside Elsie Venner's.  Do you go armed?\"\n\n\"I do!\" said Mr. Bernard,--and he \"put his hands up\" in the shape of fists, in such a way as\nto show that he was master of the natural weapons at any rate.\n\nThe Doctor could not help smiling.  But his face fell in an instant.\n\n\"You may want something more than those tools to work with.  Come with me into my sanctum.\"\n\nThe Doctor led Mr. Bernard into a small room opening out of the study. It was a place such\nas anybody but a medical man would shiver to enter. There was the usual tall box with its bleached,\nrattling tenant; there were jars in rows where \"interesting cases\" outlived the grief of widows\nand heirs in alcoholic immortality,--for your \"preparation-jar\" is the true \"monumentum aere\nperennius;\" there were various semi-possibilities of minute dimensions and unpromising developments;\nthere were shining instruments of evil aspect, and grim plates on the walls, and on one shelf\nby itself, accursed and apart, coiled in a long cylinder of spirit, a huge crotalus, rough-scaled,\nflatheaded, variegated with dull bands, one of which partially encircled the neck like a collar,--an\nawful wretch to look upon, with murder written all over him in horrid hieroglyphics. Mr. Bernard's\nlook was riveted on this creature,--not fascinated certainly, for its eyes looked like white\nbeads, being clouded by the action of the spirits in which it had been long kept,--but fixed\nby some indefinite sense of the renewal of a previous impression;--everybody knows the feeling,\nwith its suggestion of some past state of existence. There was a scrap of paper on the jar,\nwith something written on it.  He was reaching up to read it when the Doctor touched him lightly.\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Langdon!\" he said, with a certain vivacity of manner, as if wishing to call\naway his attention,--\"this is my armory.\"\n\nThe Doctor threw open the door of a small cabinet, where were disposed in artistic patterns\nvarious weapons of offence and defence,--for he was a virtuoso in his way, and by the side\nof the implements of the art of healing had pleased himself with displaying a collection of\nthose other instruments, the use of which renders the first necessary.\n\n\"See which of these weapons you would like best to carry about you,\" said the Doctor.\n\nMr. Bernard laughed, and looked at the Doctor as if he half doubted whether he was in earnest.\n\n\"This looks dangerous enough,\" he said,--\"for the man who carries it, at least.\"\n\nHe took down one of the prohibited Spanish daggers or knives which a traveller may, occasionally\nget hold of and smuggle out of the country. The blade was broad, trowel-like, but the point\ndrawn out several inches, so as to look like a skewer.\n\n\"This must be a jealous bull-fighter's weapon,\" he said, and put it back in its place.\n\nThen he took down an ancient-looking broad-bladed dagger, with a complex aspect about it, as\nif it had some kind of mechanism connected with it.\n\n\"Take care!\" said the Doctor; \"there is a trick to that dagger.\"\n\nHe took it and touched a spring.  The dagger split suddenly into three blades, as when one\nseparates the forefinger and the ring-finger from the middle one.  The outside blades were\nsharp on their outer edge.  The stab was to be made with the dagger shut, then the spring touched\nand the split blades withdrawn.\n\nMr. Bernard replaced it, saying, that it would have served for sidearm to old Suwarrow, who\ntold his men to work their bayonets back and forward when they pinned a Turk, but to wriggle\nthem about in the wound when they stabbed a Frenchman.\n\n\"Here,\" said the Doctor, \"this is the thing you want.\"\n\nHe took down a much more modern and familiar implement,--a small, beautifully finished revolver.\n\n\"I want you to carry this,\" he said; \"and more than that, I want you to practise with it often,\nas for amusement, but so that it maybe seen and understood that you are apt to have a pistol\nabout you. Pistol-shooting is pleasant sport enough, and there is no reason why you should\nnot practise it like other young fellows.  And now,\" the Doctor said, \"I have one other, weapon\nto give you.\"\n\nHe took a small piece of parchment and shook a white powder into it from one of his medicine-jars.\nThe jar was marked with the name of a mineral salt, of a nature to have been serviceable in\ncase of sudden illness in the time of the Borgias.  The Doctor folded the parchment carefully,\nand marked the Latin name of the powder upon it.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, handing it to Mr. Bernard, \"you see what it is, and you know what service\nit can render.  Keep these two protectors about your person day and night; they will not harm\nyou, and you may want one or the other or both before you think of it.\"\n\nMr. Bernard thought it was very odd, and not very old-gentlemanlike, to be fitting him out\nfor treason, stratagem, and spoils, in this way. There was no harm, however, in carrying a\ndoctor's powder in his pocket, or in amusing himself with shooting at a mark, as he had often\ndone before.  If the old gentleman had these fancies, it was as well to humor him.\n\nSo he thanked old Doctor Kittredge, and shook his hand warmly as he left him.\n\n\"The fellow's hand did not tremble, nor his color change,\" the Doctor said, as he watched him\nwalking away.  \"He is one of the right sort.\"\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nEPISTOLARY.\n\nMr. Langdon to the Professor.\n\nMY DEAR PROFESSOR, You were kind enough to promise me that you would assist me in any professional\nor scientific investigations in which I might become engaged.  I have of late become deeply\ninterested in a class of subjects which present peculiar difficulty, and I must exercise the\nprivilege of questioning you on some points upon which I desire information I cannot otherwise\nobtain.  I would not trouble you, if I could find any person or books competent to enlighten\nme on some of these singular matters which have so excited me.  The leading doctor here is\na shrewd, sensible man, but not versed in the curiosities of medical literature.\n\nI proceed, with your leave, to ask a considerable number of questions,--hoping to get answers\nto some of them, at least.\n\nIs there any evidence that human beings can be infected or wrought upon by poisons, or otherwise,\nso that they shall manifest any of the peculiarities belonging to beings of a lower nature?\nCan such peculiarities--be transmitted by inheritance?  Is there anything to countenance the\nstories, long and widely current, about the \"evil eye\"? or is it a mere fancy that such a power\nbelongs to any human being?  Have you any personal experience as to the power of fascination\nsaid to be exercised by certain animals?  What can you make of those circumstantial statements\nwe have seen in the papers, of children forming mysterious friendships with ophidians of different\nspecies, sharing their food with them, and seeming to be under some subtile influence exercised\nby those creatures?  Have you read, critically, Coleridge's poem of \"Christabel,\" and Keats's\n\"Lamia\"?--If so, can you understand them, or find any physiological foundation for the story\nof either?\n\nThere is another set of questions of a different nature I should like to ask, but it is hardly\nfair to put so many on a single sheet. There is one, however, you must answer.  Do you think\nthere may be predispositions, inherited or ingrafted, but at any rate constitutional, which\nshall take out certain apparently voluntary determinations from the control of the will, and\nleave them as free from moral responsibility as the instincts of the lower animals?  Do you\nnot think there may be a crime which is not a sin?\n\nPardon me, my dear Sir, for troubling you with such a list of notes of interrogation.  There\nare some very strange things going on here in this place, country-town as it is.  Country-life\nis apt to be dull; but when it once gets going, it beats the city hollow, because it gives\nits whole mind to what it is about.  These rural sinners make terrible work with the middle\nof the Decalogue, when they get started.  However, I hope I shall live through my year's school-keeping\nwithout catastrophes, though there are queer doings about me which puzzle me and might scare\nsome people.  If anything should happen, you will be one of the first to hear of it, no doubt.\nBut I trust not to help out the editors of the \"Rockland Weekly Universe\" with an obituary\nof the late lamented, who signed himself in life--\n\nYour friend and pupil, BERNARD C.  LANGDON.\n\nThe Professor to Mr. Langdon.\n\nMY DEAR MR. LANGDON, I do not wonder that you find no answer from your country friends to the\ncurious questions you put.  They belong to that middle region between science and poetry which\nsensible men, as they are called, are very shy of meddling with.  Some people think that truth\nand gold are always to be washed for; but the wiser sort are of opinion, that, unless there\nare so many grains to the peck of sand or nonsense respectively, it does not pay to wash for\neither, so long as one can find anything else to do.  I don't doubt there is some truth in\nthe phenomena of animal magnetism, for instance; but when you ask me to cradle for it, I tell\nyou that the hysteric girls cheat so, and the professionals are such a set of pickpockets,\nthat I can do something better than hunt for the grains of truth among their tricks and lies.\nDo you remember what I used to say in my lectures?--or were you asleep just then, or cutting\nyour initials on the rail?  (You see I can ask questions, my young friend.) Leverage is everything,--was\nwhat I used to say;--don't begin to pry till you have got the long arm on your side.\n\nTo please you, and satisfy your doubts as far as possible, I have looked into the old books,--into\nSchenckius and Turner and Kenelm. Digby and the rest, where I have found plenty of curious\nstories which you must take for what they are worth.\n\nYour first question I can answer in the affirmative upon pretty good authority.  Mizaldus tells,\nin his \"Memorabilia,\" the well-known story of the girl fed on poisons, who was sent by the\nking of the Indies to Alexander the Great.  \"When Aristotle saw her eyes sparkling and snapping\nlike those of serpents, he said, 'Look out for yourself, Alexander! this is a dangerous companion\nfor you!'\"--and sure enough, the young lady proved to be a very unsafe person to her friends.\nCardanus gets a story from Avicenna, of a certain man bit by a serpent, who recovered of his\nbite, the snake dying therefrom. This man afterwards had a daughter whom venomous serpents\ncould not harm, though she had a fatal power over them.\n\nI suppose you may remember the statements of old authors about Zycanthropy, the disease in\nwhich men took on the nature and aspect of wolves.  Actius and Paulus, both men of authority,\ndescribe it. Altomaris gives a horrid case; and Fincelius mentions one occurring as late as\n1541, the subject of which was captured, still insisting that he was a wolf, only that the\nhair of his hide was turned in! Versipelles, it may be remembered, was the Latin name for these\n\"were-wolves.\"\n\nAs for the cases where rabid persons have barked and bit like dogs, there are plenty of such\non record.\n\nMore singular, or at least more rare, is the account given by Andreas Baccius, of a man who\nwas struck in the hand by a cock, with his beak, and who died on the third day thereafter,\nlooking for all the world like a fighting-cock, to the great horror of the spectators.\n\nAs to impressions transmitted at a very early period of existence, every one knows the story\nof King James's fear of a naked sword, and the way it is accounted for.  Sir Kenelm Digby says,--\"I\nremember when he dubbed me Knight, in the ceremony of putting the point of a naked sword upon\nmy shoulder, he could not endure to look upon it, but turned his face another way, insomuch,\nthat, in lieu of touching my shoulder, he had almost thrust the point into my eyes, had not\nthe Duke of Buckingham guided his hand aright.\"  It is he, too, who tells the story of the\nmulberry mark upon the neck of a certain lady of high condition, which \"every year, to mulberry\nseason, did swell, grow big, and itch.\"  And Gaffarel mentions the case of a girl born with\nthe figure of a fish on one of her limbs, of which the wonder was, that, when the girl did\neat fish, this mark put her to sensible pain.  But there is no end to cases of this kind, and\nI could give some of recent date, if necessary, lending a certain plausibility at least to\nthe doctrine of transmitted impressions.\n\nI never saw a distinct case of evil eye, though I have seen eyes so bad that they might produce\nstrange effects on very sensitive natures.  But the belief in it under various names, fascination,\njettcztura, etc., is so permanent and universal, from Egypt to Italy, and from the days of\nSolomon to those of Ferdinand of Naples, that there must be some peculiarity, to say the least,\non which the opinion is based.  There is very strong evidence that some such power is exercised\nby certain of the lower animals.  Thus, it is stated on good authority that \"almost every animal\nbecomes panic-struck at the sight of the rattlesnake, and seems at once deprived of the power\nof motion, or the exercise of its usual instinct of self-preservation.\" Other serpents seem\nto share this power of fascination, as the Cobra and the Buccephalus Capensis.\n\nSome think that it is nothing but fright; others attribute it to the\n\n               \"strange powers that lie\n          Within the magic circle of the eye,\"--\n\nas Churchill said, speaking of Garrick.\n\nYou ask me about those mysterious and frightful intimacies between children and serpents, of\nwhich so many instances have been recorded. I am sure I cannot tell what to make of them. \nI have seen several such accounts in recent papers, but here is one published in the seventeenth\ncentury, which is as striking as any of the more modern ones:\n\n\"Mr. Herbert Tones of Monmouth, when he was a little Boy, was used to eat his Milk in a Garden\nin the Morning, and was no sooner there, but a large Snake always came, and eat out of the\nDish with him, and did so for a considerable time, till one Morning, he striking the Snake\non the Head, it hissed at him.  Upon which he told his Mother that the Baby (for so he call'd\nit) cry'd Hiss at him.  His Mother had it kill'd, which occasioned him a great Fit of Sickness,\nand 'twas thought would have dy'd, but did recover.\"\n\nThere was likewise one \"William Writtle, condemned at Maidston Assizes for a double murder,\ntold a Minister that was with him after he was condemned, that his mother told him, that when\nhe was a Child, there crept always to him a Snake, wherever she laid him.  Sometimes she would\nconvey him up Stairs, and leave him never so little, she should be sure to find a Snake in\nthe Cradle with him, but never perceived it did him any harm.\"\n\nOne of the most striking alleged facts connected with the mysterious relation existing between\nthe serpent and-the human species is the influence which the poison of the Crotulus, taken\ninternally, seemed to produce over the moral faculties, in the experiments instituted by Dr.\nHering at Surinam.  There is something frightful in the disposition of certain ophidians, as\nthe whipsnake, which darts at the eyes of cattle without any apparent provocation or other\nmotive. It is natural enough that the evil principle should have been represented in the form\nof a serpent, but it is strange to think of introducing it into a human being like cow-pox\nby vaccination.\n\nYou know all about the Psylli, or ancient serpent tamers, I suppose. Savary gives an account\nof the modern serpent-tamers in his \"Letters on Egypt.\"  These modern jugglers are in the habit\nof making the venomous Naja counterfeit death, lying out straight and stiff, changing it into\na rod, as the ancient magicians did with their serpents, (probably the same animal,) in the\ntime of Moses.\n\nI am afraid I cannot throw much light on \"Christabel\" or \"Lamia\" by any criticism I can offer.\nGeraldine, in the former, seems to be simply a malignant witch-woman with the evil eye, but\nwith no absolute ophidian relationship.  Lamia is a serpent transformed by magic into a woman.\nThe idea of both is mythological, and not in any sense physiological.  Some women unquestionably\nsuggest the image of serpents; men rarely or never. I have been struck, like many others, with\nthe ophidian head and eye of the famous Rachel.\n\nYour question about inherited predispositions, as limiting the sphere of the will, and, consequently,\nof moral accountability, opens a very wide range of speculation."}

{"ID": 680, "text": "Although\ncertainly not less in need of reformation, they were far less inclined to welcome it. The fashionable\nindifference to religion was an obstacle which Wesley found much more difficult to overcome\nthan the brutal ignorance of the inmates of Newgate. After listening to a sermon by Whitefield,\nBolingbroke complimented the preacher by saying that he had \"done great justice to the divine\nattributes.\" The Duchess of Buckingham's remarks on the preaching of the Methodists, in a letter\nto Lady Huntingdon, are an amusing commentary on the times. \"I thank your ladyship for the\ninformation concerning the Methodist preachers. Their doctrines are most repulsive, and strongly\ntinctured with impertinence and disrespect toward their superiors, in perpetually endeavoring\nto level all ranks and do away with all distinctions. It is monstrous to be told that you have\na heart as sinful as the common wretches that crawl the earth. This is highly offensive and\ninsulting, and I cannot but wonder that your ladyship should relish any sentiments so much\nat variance with high rank and good-breeding.\"[187] High rank and good-breeding, however, in\nthe society of which the Duchess of Buckingham was so proud, were not considered inconsistent\nwith habitual drunkenness, indecency, and profanity. The vices which \"the common wretches that\ncrawl the earth\" practised in addition to these, her Grace would have had difficulty in mentioning.\n\nStill, in the latter half of the eighteenth century is to be traced a continual improvement,\nwhich is reflected in contemporary fiction. As a remarkable example of the change which took\nplace may be mentioned the instance of the Earl of March. \"As Duke of Queensberry, at nearer\nninety than eighty years of age, he was still rolling in wealth, still wallowing in sin, and\nregarded by his countrymen as one whom it was hardly decent to name, because he did not choose,\nout of respect for the public opinion of 1808, to discontinue a mode of existence which in\n1768 was almost a thing of course\" among the higher ranks.[188]\n\n[Footnote 184: Wilson's \"Memoirs of Daniel Defoe.\"]\n\n[Footnote 185: For the diary of Thomas Turner, see \"Glimpses of our Ancestors,\" by Charles\nFleet, pp. 31-52.]\n\n[Footnote 186: For these manifestations, see Wesley's \"Journal,\" and Lecky's \"History of England\nin the Eighteenth Century,\" vol. II, chap. ix.]\n\n[Footnote 187: Lecky, \"Hist. of England in the 18th Century,\" vol. ii, chap. 9.]\n\n[Footnote 188: See Trevelyan's \"Early History of Charles James Fox,\" Harper's ed., p. 75.]\n\nII.\n\nIn 1759, were published the first two volumes of \"Tristram Shandy,\" a singular and brilliant\nmedley of wit, sentiment, indecency, and study of character. Laurence Sterne was a profligate\nclergyman, a dishonest author, and an unfaithful husband. He wrote \"Tristram Shandy,\" and he\nwrote a great many sermons. He descended to the indulgence of low tastes, and rose to an elevated\nstrain of thought, with equal facility. He was a man who knew the better and followed the worse.\nHis talents made him a welcome guest at great men's tables, where he paid for his dinner by\namusing the company with a brilliant succession of witticisms and indecent anecdotes, which,\nto his hearers, derived an additional piquancy from the fact that they proceeded from the mouth\nof a divine. But although the man was in many respects contemptible, although he disgraced\nhis priestly character by his profligacy, and his literary character by a shameless plagiarism,[189]\nhe possessed in a high degree a quality which must give him a distinguished place in English\nfiction. His borrowed plumage and his imitation of Rabelais' style apart, Sterne had originality,\na gift at all times rare, and always, perhaps, becoming rarer. As a humorist, he is to be classed\nwith Fielding and Smollett, but as a novelist, his position in the history of fiction is separate\nand unique.\n\n\"Tristram Shandy\" has all the elements of a novel except the plot. The author has no story\nto tell. His aim is to amuse the reader by odd and whimsical remarks on every subject and on\nevery personage whose peculiarities promise material for humor and satire. Sterne is perpetually\ndigressing, moralizing commenting on every trivial topic which enters into his story, until\nthe story itself is completely lost, if, indeed, it can be said ever to have been begun. The\nabsence of arrangement is so marked that it is very difficult to turn to a passage which in\na previous perusal has struck the eye. The eccentricity and whimsicality of the book contributed\ngreatly to its immediate popularity. But the same characteristics which seem brilliant when\nnovel, soon become dull when familiar, and although \"Tristram Shandy\" will always afford single\npassages of lasting interest to the lover of literature, the work as a whole is not a little\ntedious when read continuously from cover to cover.\n\nIn the course of his literary medley, Sterne introduces his reader to a group of characters\namongst the most odd and original in fiction. Mr. Shandy, with his syllogisms and his hypotheses,\nhis \"close reasoning upon the smallest matters\"; Yorick, the witty parson, whose epitaph, _Alas!\nPoor Yorick!_ expresses so tenderly the amiable faults for which he suffered; Captain Shandy,\nthat combination of simplicity, gentleness, humanity, and modesty, are all creations which\ndeserve to rank with the most individual and happily conceived of fictitious personages. Sterne\nmakes a character known to the reader by a succession of delicate touches rather than by description.\nHe seems to enter into an individual, and make him betray his peculiarities by significant\nactions and phrases. Thus Mr. Shandy exposes at once the nature of his mind and the vigor of\nhis \"hobby-horse,\" when he exclaims to his brother Toby: \"What is the character of a family\nto an hypothesis?\"\n\nThe combination of sentiment, pathos, and humor which Sterne sometimes reached with remarkable\nsuccess, is particularly apparent in every incident which concerns the celebrated Captain Toby\nShandy, for the creation of which character this author may most easily be forgiven his indecencies\nand his literary thefts. Uncle Toby's sympathy with Lefevre, a poor army officer, on his way\nto join his regiment, who died in an inn near Shandy's house, is exquisitely painted throughout,\nand the colloquy between the captain and his faithful servant, Corporal Trim, when the death\nof the officer is imminent, is probably the finest passage which ever fell from the skilful\npen of Laurence Sterne:\n\n    A sick brother-officer should have the best quarters, Trim; and if\n    we had him with us,--we could tend and look to him.--Thou art an\n    excellent nurse thyself, Trim: and what with thy care of him, and\n    the old woman's, and his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit\n    him again at once, and set him upon his legs.\n\n    --In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle Toby, smiling, he\n    might march.--He will never march, an' please your Honour, in this\n    world, said the Corporal.--He _will_ march, said my uncle Toby,\n    rising up from the side of the bed with one shoe off.--An' please\n    your Honour, said the Corporal, he will never march but to his\n    grave. He _shall_ march, cried my uncle Toby, marching the foot\n    which had a shoe on, though without advancing an inch,--he _shall_\n    march to his regiment.--He cannot stand it, said the Corporal.--He\n    shall be supported, said my uncle Toby.--He'll drop at last, said\n    the Corporal, and what will become of his boy? He _shall not_ drop\n    said my uncle Toby, firmly,--Ah, well-a-day!--do what we can for\n    him, said Trim, maintaining his point,--the poor soul will\n    die.--_He shall not die, by G--_, cried my uncle Toby.\n\n    --The _accusing spirit_, which flew up to Heaven's chancery with\n    the oath, blushed as he gave it in;--and the _recording angel_, as\n    he wrote it down, dropped a tear upon the word, and blotted it out\n    for ever.[190]\n\n\"Ye, who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and pursue with eagerness the phantoms\nof hope; who expect that age will perform the promises of youth, and that the deficiencies\nof the present day will be supplied by the morrow; attend to the history of Rasselas, Prince\nof Abyssinia.\" Thus begins the famous tale which Dr. Johnson made the repository of so much\nof his wisdom, and so beautiful an example of English style. Rasselas and his royal brothers\nand sisters live in a secluded portion of the earth known as the Happy Valley, where, completely\nisolated from the world, they await their succession to the crown of the imaginary land of\nAbyssinia, surrounded by every luxury which can make life agreeable, and shut off from all\nknowledge of those evils which can make it painful. The aim of the story is to show the vanity\nof expecting perfect happiness, and the folly of sacrificing present advantages for the delusive\npromises of the future.\n\nThe scene opens in the Happy Valley, where there is all that labor or danger can procure or\npurchase, without either labor to be endured or danger to be dreaded. Rasselas illustrates\nthe habitual discontent of man by wearying of the monotonous happiness of his royal home, and,\ntogether with his sister Nekayah, who shares his ennui, and Imlac, a man of learning, he escapes\nfrom the abode of changeless joys and perpetual merriment.\n\nOnce beyond the barriers of the Happy Valley, Rasselas and Nekayah seek in the various ranks\nand conditions of men the abode of true happiness. It is sought in vain amidst the hollow and\nnoisy pleasures of the young and thoughtless; in vain among philosophers, whose theories so\nill accord with their practice; in vain among shepherds, whose actual life contrasts so painfully\nwith the descriptions of the poet; in vain in crowds, where sorrow lurks beneath the outward\nsmile; in vain in the cell of the hermit, who counts the days till he shall once more mix with\nthe world. The task becomes more hopeless with each new disappointment. Rasselas pursues his\ninvestigation among the higher ranks, in courts and cities; Nekayah, hers among the poor and\nhumble, in the shop and the hamlet. But when the brother and sister meet to share their experiences,\nthey both have the same tale to tell of human discontent. Finally, in returning disappointed\nto Abyssinia, they illustrate the tendency among men to look back with regret on the early\npleasures of life, abandoned for the impossible happiness which discontent had taught them to seek.\n\nOn this slight thread of narrative, Johnson strung his thoughts with great felicity. The characters,\nby the different view which they entertain of life, are distinct and individual. The book is\nfilled with pregnant and beautiful passages, which leave a deep impression on the reader. The\nwords in which Imlac describes to the Prince and Princess the dangers of an unrestrained imagination,\nmight, with equal propriety, find a place in a scientific treatise on the causes of insanity,\nand in a collection of beautiful literary extracts:\n\n    To indulge the power of fiction, and send imagination out upon the\n    wing, is often the sport of those who delight too much in silent\n    speculation. When we are alone, we are not always busy; the labour\n    of excogitation is too violent to last long; the ardour of inquiry\n    will sometimes give way to idleness or satiety. He who has nothing\n    external that can divert him, must find pleasure in his own\n    thoughts, and must conceive himself what he is not; for who is\n    pleased with what he is? He then expatiates in boundless futurity,\n    and culls from all imaginable conditions that which for the present\n    moment he should most desire, amuses his desires with impossible\n    enjoyments, and confers upon his pride unattainable dominion. The\n    mind dances from scene to scene, unites all pleasures in all\n    combinations, and riots in delights which nature and fortune, with\n    all their bounty, cannot bestow.\n\n    In time, some particular train of ideas fixes the attention; all\n    other intellectual gratifications are rejected; the mind, in\n    weariness or leisure, recurs constantly to the favorite conception,\n    and feasts on the luscious falsehood whenever she is offended with\n    the bitterness of truth. By degrees, the reign of fancy is\n    confirmed; she grows first imperious, and in time, despotic. Then\n    fictions begin to operate as realities, false opinions fasten upon\n    the mind, and life passes in dreams of rapture or of anguish.[191]\n\nThe resemblance between Johnson's \"Rasselas\" and Voltaire's \"Candide\" is so marked, that had\neither author seen the other's work, he must have been suspected of imitation. But while both\nthese great minds were writing at nearly the same time on the same theme of human misery, the\nlessons they taught differed in a manner which is strongly illustrative of the differences\nbetween the two men and their respective surroundings. French scepticism and distrust of divine\npower led Voltaire to impute human griefs to the incapacity of the Creator. But Johnson, writing\n\"Rasselas\" in an hour of sorrow, to obtain means to pay for his mother's funeral, taught that\nthat happiness, which this world can not afford, should be sought in the prospect of another\nand a better.[192]\n\nAll readers of Boswell know how the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" found a publisher. How Goldsmith's\nlandlady arrested him for his rent, and how he wrote to Johnson in his distress. How the kind\nlexicographer sent a guinea at once, and followed to find the guinea already changed, and a\nbottle of Madeira before the persecuted but philosophical author. How Johnson put the cork\nin the bottle, and after a hasty glance at the MS. of the \"Vicar of Wakefield,\" went out and\nsold it for sixty pounds. And how triumphantly Goldsmith rated his landlady.\n\nIn the hands of that bookseller, who purchased the novel as much out of charity as in hope\nof profit, the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" remained neglected, until the publication of \"The Traveler\"\nhad made the author famous. This interval would have afforded Goldsmith ample time to correct\nthe obvious inconsistencies and faults which his work contained. But in the spirit of a man\nwho depended on his pen for his bread, he made no effort to improve what had already brought\nhim all this remuneration for which he could hope. This is the more to be regretted, that very\nlittle revision would have been sufficient, to make the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" as perfect in\nits construction as in its style and spirit. \"There are a hundred faults in this thing,\" says\nthe preface, \"and a hundred things might be said to prove them beauties. But it is needless.\nA book may be amusing with numerous errors, or it may be very dull without a single absurdity.\nThe hero of this piece unites in himself the three greatest characters upon earth;--he is a\npriest, a husbandman, and the father of a family. He is drawn as ready to teach, and ready\nto obey--as simple in affluence, and majestic in adversity.\"\n\nThese few words are not an inaccurate statement of the merits and demerits of the \"Vicar of\nWakefield.\" Faults there are, certainly. The improbability of Sir William Thornhill's being\nable to go about among his own tenantry _incognito_, without other disguise than a change of\ndress; the inconsistency of the philanthropist's allowing his villainous nephew to retain possession\nof the wealth which he used only to assist him in his crimes; and, finally, the impossibility\nof that nephew's being so nearly of an age with Sir William himself, when he must have been\nthe son of a younger brother, are all blemishes which Goldsmith might easily have removed,\nhad he not relied on the opinion which he expressed in Chapter xv, \"the reputation of books\nis raised, not by their freedom from defect, but by the greatness of their beauties.\"\n\nSuch a rule would be an obviously dangerous one for an author to follow. But Goldsmith's confidence\nin the beauties of his novel was fully justified by the verdict of the world. No novelist has\nmore deeply imbued his work with his own genius and spirit, and none have had a more beneficent\ngenius, nor a more beautiful spirit to impart than the author of \"The Deserted Village.\" The\nexquisite style, the delicate choice of words, the amiability of sentiment, so peculiarly his\nown, and so well suited to express the simple beauty of his thoughts, give a charm to the work\nwhich familiarity can only endear. Dr. Primrose, preserving his simplicity, his modesty, and\nhis nobility of character alike when surrounded by the pleasures of his early and prosperous\nhome, when struggling with the hardships of his ruined fortune, and when rewarded at last by\nthe surfeit of good-fortune which follows his trial, stands high among the most noble conceptions\nof English fiction. \"We read the 'Vicar of Wakefield,'\" said the great Sir Walter, \"in youth\nand in age. We return to it again and again, and bless the memory of an author who contrives\nso well to reconcile us to human nature.\"\n\nGoethe, when in his eighty-first year, declared that Goldsmith's novel \"was his delight at\nthe age of twenty, that it had in a manner formed a part of his education, influencing his\ntastes and feelings throughout life, and that he had recently read it again from beginning\nto end, with renewed delight, and with a grateful sense of the early benefit derived from it.\"\n\"Rogers, the Nestor of British literature, whose refined purity of taste and exquisite mental\norganization rendered him eminently calculated to appreciate a work of the kind, declared that\nof all the books, which, through the fitful changes of three generations he had seen rise and\nfall, the charm of the 'Vicar of Wakefield' had alone continued as at first; and could he revisit\nthe world after an interval of many more generations, he should as surely look to find it undiminished.\"\nSo wrote Washington Irving; and if the reader is inclined to look for the causes of the extraordinary\nendurance of Goldsmith's work, he can find them nowhere better stated than in the words of\nJohn Forster: \"Not in those graces of style, nor even in that home-cherished gallery of familiar\nfaces can the secret of its extraordinary fascination be said to consist. It lies nearer the\nheart. A something which has found its way _there_; which, while it amused, has made us happier;\nwhich, gently interweaving itself with our habits of thought, has increased our good-humour\nand charity; which, insensibly it may be, has corrected wilful impatiences of temper, and made\nthe world's daily accidents easier and kinder to us all; somewhat thus should be expressed,\nI think, the charm of the 'Vicar of Wakefield.'\"\n\nIn 1760 was published \"Chrysal, the Adventures of a Guinea,\" by Charles Johnstone, the author\nof several deservedly forgotten novels.[193] The first volume was sent to Dr. Johnson for his\nopinion, who thought, as Boswell tells us, that it should be published--an estimate justified\nby the considerable circulation which the book enjoyed.\n\nChrysal is an elementary spirit, whose abode is in a piece of gold converted into a guinea.\nIn that form the spirit passes from man to man, and takes accurate note of the different scenes\nof which it becomes a witness. This is a natural and favorable medium for a satire, which Johnstone\nprobably owed, in some measure, both to the \"Diable Boiteux\" of Gil Blas, and the \"Adventures\nof a Halfpenny\" of Dr. Bathurst. The circulation of the guinea enables the author to describe\nthe characteristics of its possessors as seen by a truthful witness, and he has taken advantage\nof his opportunity to produce one of the most disgusting records of vice in literature. A depraved\nmind only could find any pleasure in reading \"Chrysal,\" and whoever is obliged to read it from\ncover to cover for the purpose of describing it to others, must find himself, at the end of\nhis task, in sore vexation of spirit. Human depravity is never an agreeable subject for a work\nof entertainment, and while Swift's genius holds the reader fascinated with the horror of his\nYahoos, the ability of a Manley or a Johnstone is not sufficient to aid the reader in wading\nthrough their vicious expositions of corruption. It must be said that Johnstone had some excuse.\nIf he were to satirize society at all, it was better that he should do it thoroughly; that\nhe should expose official greed and dishonesty, the orgies of Medenham Abbey, the infamous\nextortions of trading justices, in all their native ugliness."}

Immediate\nemancipation of all slaves, with compensation for all, costing, as it would, twelve hundred\nmillions of dollars, is now beyond the power of the Government, burdened as it is by an enormous\nand increasing debt.

Would we avoid like disasters in solving this stupendous problem,\nwe must follow, in humble faith, the ways of God, and thus by gentle, but constant and successive\nmovements, reach the grand result.\n\nHistory, however, exhibits a few extraordinary cases, in which man, as an instrument in the\nhands of Providence, sometimes punishes great crimes, eradicates great evils, and accomplishes\ngreat national reforms by acts as sudden as the devastating career of the tempest in sweeping\naway pestilential vapors. Such may be the case with the revolted States, if they should persist\nin this wicked rebellion beyond the close of the period of solemn warning.\n\nThe coming year may be the great crisis of human destiny. It may see our rivers, like those\nof Egypt, turned into blood. It may witness similar loathsome plagues, and pestilence, and\nfiery hail, and darkness palpable. But may it never behold the dread work of the destroying\nangel as of old, at the midnight hour, in every dwelling whose lintels were unmarked by the\ntypical blood of the Paschal sacrifice! Avoiding the last dread scene of the great Egyptian\ndrama, may we have, not the Jewish Passover, but the grand American jubilee, when we may hail\nthe South redeemed from the curse of slavery, and forever united with the North, as the one\nblessed home of universal freedom.\n\nAs the South was as earnest as the North in protesting against the landing upon our shores\nof the first cargo of African slaves, and the continuance of the traffic so long forced upon\nus under the British flag, and as they all united in excluding the word 'slave' from the Federal\nConstitution, so will they ultimately co\u00f6perate in expunging from our system the institution\nof slavery.\n\nI shall discuss this question as to the border States under no sectional or party aspect, no\ninfluence of passion or prejudice, or any motive but the desire to promote the good of my country.\nOur national and material interests must be fully considered, as also those great moral principles\nand intellectual developments which exalt and dignify the character of man. I shall examine\nthe subject inductively and deductively, the facts and the causes.\n\nThat a return to the Union with gradual emancipation and colonization by the rebel States would\nbe best for them and for us is certain. But in justice to loyal citizens and communities, and\nto avoid the danger of foreign intervention by prolonging the contest, it is our duty, after\nthe close of this year, to withdraw the slaves in the rebel States from the culture of the\ncrops used to support their armies, which can only be done by general emancipation in such\nStates persisting then in the rebellion. This is a necessary war measure, designed, like battles\nor blockades, to suppress the rebellion (alike ruinous to North and South), and which must\nno longer be permitted to accumulate an immense debt and oppressive taxation, and to exhaust\nour blood and treasure. The census shows that very few slaves are held by the deluded masses\nof the South, that the slaveholders are few in number; and full compensation is contemplated\nby Congress and the President, in all cases of the manumission by us of the slaves of loyal\ncitizens.\n\nBy the census of 1790, all the sixteen States then enumerated held slaves, except Massachusetts\n(then including Maine, although numbered separately), where the institution was abolished by\na judicial construction of their constitution of 1780. The following table, from the census,\nshows the gradual disappearance of slavery from seven of these States, the remaining eight\nStates still continuing the institution:\n\n                1790    1800    1810    1820    '30  '40  '50 '60\n   N.

An effort was made in Congress to defeat the admission of Illinois,\non the ground that its constitution 'did not conform to the ordinance of 1787.' But it was\nthen decided by the House of Representatives (117 to 54) that 'the ordinance did not extend\nto States.' In the Senate the vote was _unanimous_. (See Niles's Register, vol. xix. p. 30.)\nRhode Island adopted the Pennsylvania system. Connecticut declared free, at the age of 26,\nall born after the 1st March, 1784. Indiana pursued in its results the course of Illinois.\nBy the census, Illinois had 917 slaves in 1820, 747 in 1830, 331 in 1840; and Indiana had 190\nslaves in 1820, 3 in 1830, and 3 in 1840. New York in 1799 continued in bondage the slaves\nthen living, but those born _after_ the date of the law were emancipated at the age of 28;\nand in New Jersey, the males at 25 and the females at 21. This slow and gradual process in\nStates having so few slaves, should inculcate kinder and more indulgent feelings as to those\nloyal communities where the slaves are so much more numerous, and the time and mode of action\nso vital.\n\nThe great model act of gradual emancipation, drawn by Benjamin Franklin, the great leader on\nthis question, approved by the Quakers, and adopted by Pennsylvania in 1780, liberated all\nthe descendants of slaves born after that date within the limits of the State. To avoid circumlocution,\nI shall call those born before the date of emancipating laws the _ante nati_, and those born\nafter the date of such laws, _post nati_.\n\nI shall consider first the question of gradual emancipation and colonization in connection\nwith Maryland, and afterward apply the same principles to other States.\n\nIf the Pennsylvania system of liberating immediately only the post nati, so much more liberal\nthan that of most of the free States, were adopted by Maryland, the cost of manumission there\nwould be very small. In the execution of the emancipation act of Congress in this District,\ninfant slaves were valued officially this year by sworn experts at $50 each. Now by the census\nof 1860, the infant slaves of Maryland, under one year old, surviving on the 1st June, 1860,\nnumbered 2,391, which, at $50 each, would cost $119,550. This would be the actual expense for\nthe first year in Maryland, but decreasing every year, and ceasing altogether in little more\nthan a generation. Now the total number of slaves under one year of age, born in all the slave\nStates, and surviving on the 1st June, 1860, was, by the census, 113,581, which, at $50 each,\nwould cost $5,679,050, for the first year, and decreasing annually as above stated. The post\nnati numbered in Delaware 40, in Kentucky 7,281, in Missouri 3,377, and in Virginia 13,850,\nmaking the first year's cost as follows:\n\n   Maryland               $119,550\n   Delaware                  2,000\n   Kentucky                364,050\n   Missouri                168,850\n                          --------\n                           654,450\n   Virginia                692,500\n                        ----------\n                Total,  $1,346,950\n\nNow then, applying this principle to Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri, the cost,\nthe first year, would be $654,450, and, if we included Virginia, $1,346,950. This sum, we have\nseen, would decrease every year. According then to the annual tables, and those of expectancies\nof life (as calculated for me), the sum of fifteen millions of dollars of United States stock,\nissued now, and bearing interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum, would make all the\nborder States free States, in the same sense in which Pennsylvania and other Northern free\nStates became so; and less than half this sum, if Virginia should not adopt the measure. The\ncase, then, as regards the border States, presents no financial difficulty whatever. If this\nplan were adopted, the same just and humane course would doubtless be pursued as in the North,\nby which the emancipated post nati would remain apprentices until they reached twenty-one years\nof age, under the same regulations, mainly, as were applicable to white children, bound out\nby the overseers of the poor. Should the border States consent to proceed more rapidly, I have\nno doubt the Government would cheerfully pay to loyal masters such additional sum as would\ngive freedom to _every slave_ in all the border States, on the 4th of July, 1876, our first\ncentennial anniversary of the Declaration of American Independence. That day, then, already\nso distinguished in the annals of humanity, would become the great epoch in the history of\nour race.\n\nAnd now let us examine the cost of all these measures. If the seceded States, including Virginia,\nshould persist in the rebellion until after the close of this year, the sum to be paid the\nloyal owners of slaves manumitted under the President's war proclamation would probably reach\n$100,000,000. The emancipation of the post nati, in the four remaining border States, would\ncost \u00a77,288,132. The manumission in those States, of all the surviving slaves, on the 4th July,\n1876, according to the same tables and estimates, would cost a sum equal to $65,000,000, issued\nnow as United States six per cent. stock, making a total for _complete emancipation in all\nthe slave States_ of $172,288,132. This is a smaller sum than four months' cost of the war,\nwhilst wholly and forever removing the discordant element which produced the rebellion, commencing\na new and glorious career of material, moral, and intellectual progress, greatly exalting the\ncharacter of the nation, invoking the blessing of God, securing the future harmony and perpetuity\nof the Union, and the ultimate fraternity of man. Never, before, would any nation have made\nso grand an investment in the gratitude of emancipated millions, the thanks of a world redeemed\nfrom bondage, the applause of the present age and of posterity--the exchequer of time and eternity.\nIt would live forever in history, and the recording angel would inscribe it in God's eternal\narchives. Statesmen, scholars, savans, philosophers, poets, patriots, orators, and divines\nwould proclaim its glory. The new drama of man's political redemption would be witnessed by\nthe audience of the world. Music would chant its praise in every clime, and all peoples would\nswell the chorus. The painter would give it immortality, and the sculptor monuments more enduring\nthan the pyramids, statues more godlike and sublime than ever crowned Grecian Parthenon, or\nadorned with Parian marble the temples of Augustan Rome. The press would glow with enthusiasm,\nand the procession of nations march in the grand ovation, not to national airs, or under national\nbanners, but under the world's new flag, and to the music of the world's new anthem of universal\nfreedom and regenerated man.\n\nThe census proves that our progress as a nation has been greatly retarded by slavery. If the\nNorth had retained, and the South had abolished slavery, their relative positions would have\nbeen reversed. Virginia would have taken the place of New York, Maryland of Massachusetts,\nDelaware of Rhode Island, Kentucky of Ohio, Missouri of Illinois, and Tennessee of Indiana.\n\nI begin with Maryland, because, in proportion to her area, she has greater natural advantages\nthan any one of the thirty-four States, and, if the comparison with the free States is most\nunfavorable to her, it will be more so as to any other Southern State, as the census shows\nthat, from 1790 to 1860, and from 1850 to 1860, Maryland increased in population per square\nmile more rapidly than any other slaveholding State.\n\nMaryland borders for two hundred miles the great free State of Pennsylvania, and Delaware one\nhundred and thirty miles, whose slaves have decreased from 8,887 in 1790, to 1,798 in 1860,\nand where slavery now exists in name only. Delaware, like Maryland, is also a loyal State,\nand would be the last to leave the Union, which it was her glory first to enter under the Constitution\nof 1787. On the west, Maryland is bounded by Preston county, Virginia, containing in 1860 a\nfree population of 13,312, and 67 slaves only. Western Virginia, bordering Maryland on the\nsouth, has voted with great unanimity to become a free State, and all appearances indicate\nthat slavery will disappear from Virginia with the close of this year. Maryland then would\nbe surrounded entirely by non-slaveholding States.\n\nWithin the heart of Maryland stands this District, where slavery is now abolished, producing\nserious losses and embarrassments to the State. The two counties of Prince George and Montgomery,\nadjoining this District, contained in 1860, 17,790 slaves, being more than one fifth of the\nslaves of the State. How long can slavery endure, and of what value is it in these counties,\nwhere every slave brought or sent to the District is free, and where it is already seriously\ncontended that the language of the Constitution, 'slaves in one _State_, escaping into _another_,'\ncannot apply to this District? With the feeling so intensified already by this rebellion against\nslavery, it cannot long exist in Maryland. By advancing legislation, and public sentiment,\nthe fugitive slave law is becoming inoperative, and slaves in Maryland are now held by a most\nprecarious tenure. Indeed, unforeseen events, as this terrible rebellion progresses, may sweep\nslavery from Maryland without compensation or colonization.\n\nBut, independent of present or future perils, it is proposed to prove, mainly by the census,\nthat all the material interests of Maryland would be greatly promoted by her prompt acceptance\nof the offer of Congress. We must consider the area, soil, climate, mines, hydraulic power,\nlocation, shore line, bays, sounds, and rivers, and such other causes as affect the advance\nof wealth and population.\n\nThe relative progress of Maryland has been slow indeed. The population of the Union, by the\ncensus of 1790, was 3,929,827, of which Maryland, containing then 319,728, constituted a twelfth\npart (12.29). In 1860, the Union numbered 31,445,080, and Maryland 687,034, constituting a\nforty-fifth part (45.76). In 1790, the free States numbered 1,968,455, Maryland's population\nthen being equal to one sixth (6.12); but, in 1860, the population of the free States was 18,920,078,\nMaryland's number then being equal to one twenty-seventh part (27.52). But, if Maryland had\nincreased as rapidly from 1790 to 1860 as the whole Union, her proportion, one twelfth part,\nwould have made her numbers in 1860, 2,620,315; and if her proportional increase had equalled\nthat of the free States, her ratio, one sixth, would have made her population in 1860, 3,153,392.\nShe might not have reached either of these results; but, before closing these articles, it\nwill be proved that, in the absence of slavery, her population, in 1860, would have been at\nleast 1,755,661, or the same per square mile as Massachusetts; and Baltimore, bearing the same\nratio to this number as to Maryland's present population, would have contained in 1860, 542,000,\ninstead of 212,000, her present number.\n\nI take the areas from the able report (November 29, 1860) of the Hon. Joseph S. Wilson, then\nCommissioner of the General Land Office, where they are for the first time accurately given,\n'excluding the water surface.' The population is taken from the census, the tables of 1850\nand 1860 being compiled with great ability, by the present superintendent, the Hon. J. C. G.\nKennedy. I compare first Massachusetts and Maryland, because they are maritime and old States,\nand both in 1790 had nearly the same population, but, as will be shown hereafter, with vastly\nsuperior natural advantages in favor of Maryland.\n\nArea of Maryland, 11,124 square miles; shore line, by tables of United States Coast Survey,\nviz.: main shore, including bays, sounds, &c., 503 miles, islands 298, rivers to head of tide\nwater 535; total, 1,336 miles.\n\nArea of Massachusetts, 7,800 square miles; shore lines, by tables of United States Coast Survey,\nviz.: main shore, including bays, sounds, &c., 435 miles, islands 259, rivers to head of tide\nwater 70; total, 764 miles. When we mark the Potomac and its tributaries, the lower Susquehanna,\nthe deep and numerous streams of the Chesapeake, the commercial advantages of Maryland over\nMassachusetts are vast indeed. Looking at the ocean shore of Maryland, and also at the Chesapeake\nbay, the largest and finest estuary in the world, indented with numerous sounds and navigable\ninlets, three fourths of its length for both shores being within Maryland, and compare this\ndeep and tranquil and protected basin, almost one continuous harbor, with the rock-bound coast\nof Massachusetts, lashed by the stormy Atlantic, the superiority of Maryland is striking.\n\nMortality in Maryland, by the late census, viz.: deaths from 1st June, 1859, to 31st May, 1860,\n7,370 persons. Same time in Massachusetts, 21,303; making the ratio of deaths to the number\nliving in Maryland, one to every 92, and in Massachusetts one to every 57; and the percentage\nof deaths in Maryland 1.09, and in Massachusetts 1.76. This rate of mortality for Massachusetts\nis confirmed by the late official report of their Secretary of State to the Legislature.\n\nAs to area, then, Maryland exceeds Massachusetts 43 per cent.; as to the shore line, that of\nMaryland is nearly double that of Massachusetts, having 68 miles more of main shore, bays,\nand sounds, 38 miles more for islands, and nearly eight times the number of miles for rivers\nto head of tide water. As to climate, that of Maryland, we have seen, is far the most salubrious.\nThis is a vast advantage, not only in augmented wealth and numbers, from fewer deaths, but\nalso as attracting capital and immigration. This milder and more salubrious climate gives to\nMaryland longer periods for sowing, working, and harvesting crops, a more genial sun, larger\nproducts, and better and longer crop seasons, great advantages for stock, especially in winter,\ndecreased consumption of fuel, a greater period for the use of hydraulic power, and of canals\nand navigable streams. The area of Maryland fit for profitable culture is more than double\nthat of Massachusetts, the soil much more fertile, its mines of coal and iron, with the fluxes\nall adjacent, rich and inexhaustible; whereas Massachusetts has no coal, and no valuable mines\nof iron or fluxes. When we reflect that coal and iron are the great elements of modern progress,\nand build up mighty empires, this advantage of Maryland over Massachusetts is almost incalculable.\nThe hydraulic power of Maryland also greatly exceeds that of Massachusetts. Such are the vast\nnatural advantages of Maryland over Massachusetts. Now let us observe the results. Population\nof Maryland in 1790, 319,728; in 1860, 687,034; increase 367,300. Population of Massachusetts\nin 1790, 378,717; in 1860, 1,231,065--increase 852,348; difference of increase in favor of\nMassachusetts, 485,048; excess of Massachusetts over Maryland in 1790, 58,989, and in 1860,\n544,031. This result is amazing, when we regard the far greater area of Maryland and her other\nvast natural advantages. The population of Maryland in 1790 was 28 to the square mile (28.74),\nand in 1860, 61 to the square mile (61.76); whereas Massachusetts had 48 to the square mile\nin 1790 (48.55), and 157 to the square mile in 1860 (157.82). Thus Massachusetts had only 20\nmore to the square mile in 1790, and 96 more to the square mile in 1860. But if the areas of\nMaryland and Massachusetts had been reversed, Massachusetts, with the area of Maryland, and\nthe population of Massachusetts of 1860 to the square mile, would have numbered then 1,755,661,\nand Maryland, with the area of Massachusetts and the population of Maryland of 1860 to the\nsquare mile, would have had then a population of only 481,728 upon that basis, leaving Massachusetts\nin 1860, 1,273,393 more people than Maryland. Thus is the assertion in a former part of this\narticle now proved, 'that in the absence of slavery, the population of Maryland in 1860 would\nhave then been at least 1,755,661, and Baltimore at least 542,000.' But, in view of the many\nother natural advantages of Maryland, as shown in this article, viz.: in climate and salubrity,\nin shore line and navigable rivers, in fertility of soil, and hydraulic power, in a more central\nlocation for trade with the whole Union, and especially with the West, and nearer supplies\nof cotton, and, above all, in coal and iron, it is clear, in the absence of slavery, Maryland\nmust have contained in 1860 a population of at least two millions. By the census of 1790, Massachusetts\nwas the fourth in population of all the States, and Maryland the sixth; but in 1860, Massachusetts\nwas the seventh, and Maryland the nineteenth; and if each of the thirty-four States increases\nin the same ratio from 1860 to 1870, as from 1850 to 1860, Maryland will be only the twenty-fifth\nState.\n\nThese facts all conclusively attest the terrible effects of slavery on Maryland, and this is\nonly one of the dreadful sacrifices she has made in retaining the institution. As to wealth,\npower, and intellectual development, the loss cannot be overstated.\n\nNor can manufactures account for the difference, as shown by the still greater increase of\nthe agricultural North-West. Besides, Maryland (omitting slavery) had far greater natural advantages\nfor manufactures than Massachusetts. She had a more fertile soil, thus furnishing cheaper food\nto the working classes, a larger and more accessible coast, and nearly eight times the length\nof navigable rivers, greater hydraulic power, vast superiority in mines of coal and iron, a\nfar more salubrious climate, cotton, the great staple of modern industry, much nearer to Maryland,\nher location far more central for trade with the whole Union, and Baltimore, her chief city,\nnearer than Boston to the great West, viz,: to the Ohio at Pittsburg and Cincinnati, the Mississippi\nat St. Louis, and the lakes at Cleveland, Toledo, and Chicago, by several hundred miles. Indeed,\nbut for slavery, Maryland must have been a far greater manufacturing as well as commercial\nState than Massachusetts--and as to agriculture, there could be no comparison.\n\nBut Massachusetts did not become a manufacturing State until after the tariff of 1824. That\nmeasure, as well as the whole protective policy, Massachusetts earnestly opposed in 1820 and\n1824, and Daniel Webster, as her representative, denounced it as unconstitutional. From 1790\nto 1820 Massachusetts was commercial, not manufacturing, and yet, from 1790 to 1820, Massachusetts\nincreased in numbers 144,442, and Maryland in the same time only 87,622. Yet, from 1790 to\n1820, Massachusetts, the most commercial State, was far more injured by the embargo and the\nlate war with England than any other State.\n\nIt is clear, then, that the accusation of the secession leaders that the North was built up\nat the expense of the South, by the tariff, can have no application to the progress of Massachusetts\nand Maryland, because the advance of the former over the latter preceded by more than thirty\nyears the adoption of the protective policy, and a comparison of the relative advance of the\nfree and slave States, during the same period, exhibits the same results."}

Lucio asked\nhim to deny, if he dared, that he called the Duke a fool and a coward, and had had his nose\npulled for his impudence.\n\n\"To prison with him!\" shouted Escalus, but as hands were laid upon him, the Duke pulled off\nhis friar's hood, and was a Duke before them all.\n\n\"Now,\" he said to Angelo, \"if you have any impudence that can yet serve you, work it for all\nit's worth.\"\n\n\"Immediate sentence and death is all I beg,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Were you affianced to Mariana?\" asked the Duke.\n\n\"I was,\" said Angelo.\n\n\"Then marry her instantly,\" said his master. \"Marry them,\" he said to Friar Peter, \"and return\nwith them here.\"\n\n\"Come hither, Isabel,\" said the Duke, in tender tones. \"Your friar is now your Prince, and\ngrieves he was too late to save your brother;\" but well the roguish Duke knew he had saved him.\n\n\"O pardon me,\" she cried, \"that I employed my Sovereign in my trouble.\"\n\n\"You are pardoned,\" he said, gaily.\n\nAt that moment Angelo and his wife re-entered. \"And now, Angelo,\" said the Duke, gravely, \"we\ncondemn thee to the block on which Claudio laid his head!\"\n\n\"O my most gracious lord,\" cried Mariana, \"mock me not!\"\n\n\"You shall buy a better husband,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"O my dear lord,\" said she, \"I crave no better man.\"\n\nIsabella nobly added her prayer to Mariana's, but the Duke feigned inflexibility.\n\n\"Provost,\" he said, \"how came it that Claudio as executed at an unusual hour?\"\n\nAfraid to confess the lie he had imposed upon Angelo, the Provost said, \"I had a private message.\"\n\n\"You are discharged from your office,\" said the Duke. The Provost then departed. Angelo said,\n\"I am sorry to have caused such sorrow. I prefer death to mercy.\" Soon there was a motion in\nthe crowd. The Provost re-appeared with Claudio. Like a big child the Provost said, \"I saved\nthis man; he is like Claudio.\" The Duke was amused, and said to Isabella, \"I pardon him because\nhe is like your brother. He is like my brother, too, if you, dear Isabel, will be mine.\"\n\nShe was his with a smile, and the Duke forgave Angelo, and promoted the Provost.\n\nLucio he condemned to marry a stout woman with a bitter tongue.\n\nTWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA\n\nOnly one of them was really a gentleman, as you will discover later. Their names were Valentine\nand Proteus. They were friends, and lived at Verona, a town in northern Italy. Valentine was\nhappy in his name because it was that of the patron saint of lovers; it is hard for a Valentine\nto be fickle or mean. Proteus was unhappy in his name, because it was that of a famous shape-changer,\nand therefore it encouraged him to be a lover at one time and a traitor at another.\n\nOne day, Valentine told his friend that he was going to Milan. \"I'm not in love like you,\"\nsaid he, \"and therefore I don't want to stay at home.\"\n\nProteus was in love with a beautiful yellow-haired girl called Julia, who was rich, and had\nno one to order her about. He was, however, sorry to part from Valentine, and he said, \"If\never you are in danger tell me, and I will pray for you.\" Valentine then went to Milan with\na servant called Speed, and at Milan he fell in love with the Duke of Milan's daughter, Silvia.\n\nWhen Proteus and Valentine parted Julia had not acknowledged that she loved Proteus. Indeed,\nshe had actually torn up one of his letters in the presence of her maid, Lucetta. Lucetta,\nhowever, was no simpleton, for when she saw the pieces she said to herself, \"All she wants\nis to be annoyed by another letter.\" Indeed, no sooner had Lucetta left her alone than Julia\nrepented of her tearing, and placed between her dress and her heart the torn piece of paper\non which Proteus had signed his name. So by tearing a letter written by Proteus she discovered\nthat she loved him. Then, like a brave, sweet girl, she wrote to Proteus, \"Be patient, and\nyou shall marry me.\"\n\nDelighted with these words Proteus walked about, flourishing Julia's letter and talking to himself.\n\n\"What have you got there?\" asked his father, Antonio.\n\n\"A letter from Valentine,\" fibbed Proteus.\n\n\"Let me read it,\" said Antonio.\n\n\"There is no news,\" said deceitful Proteus; \"he only says that he is very happy, and the Duke\nof Milan is kind to him, and that he wishes I were with him.\"\n\nThis fib had the effect of making Antonio think that his son should go to Milan and enjoy the\nfavors in which Valentine basked. \"You must go to-morrow,\" he decreed. Proteus was dismayed.\n\"Give me time to get my outfit ready.\" He was met with the promise, \"What you need shall be\nsent after you.\"\n\nIt grieved Julia to part from her lover before their engagement was two days' old. She gave\nhim a ring, and said, \"Keep this for my sake,\" and he gave her a ring, and they kissed like\ntwo who intend to be true till death. Then Proteus departed for Milan.\n\nMeanwhile Valentine was amusing Silvia, whose grey eyes, laughing at him under auburn hair,\nhad drowned him in love. One day she told him that she wanted to write a pretty letter to a\ngentleman whom she thought well of, but had no time: would he write it? Very much did Valentine\ndislike writing that letter, but he did write it, and gave it to her coldly. \"Take it back,\"\nshe said; \"you did it unwillingly.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" he said, \"it was difficult to write such a letter for you.\"\n\n\"Take it back,\" she commanded; \"you did not write tenderly enough.\"\n\nValentine was left with the letter, and condemned to write another; but his servant Speed saw\nthat, in effect, the Lady Silvia had allowed Valentine to write for her a love-letter to Valentine's\nown self. \"The joke,\" he said, \"is as invisible as a weather-cock on a steeple.\" He meant that\nit was very plain; and he went on to say exactly what it was: \"If master will write her love-letters,\nhe must answer them.\"\n\nOn the arrival of Proteus, he was introduced by Valentine to Silvia and afterwards, when they\nwere alone, Valentine asked Proteus how his love for Julia was prospering.\n\n\"Why,\" said Proteus, \"you used to get wearied when I spoke of her.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" confessed Valentine, \"but it's different now. I can eat and drink all day with nothing\nbut love on my plate and love in my cup.\"\n\n\"You idolize Silvia,\" said Proteus.\n\n\"She is divine,\" said Valentine.\n\n\"Come, come!\" remonstrated Proteus.\n\n\"Well, if she's not divine,\" said Valentine, \"she is the queen of all women on earth.\"\n\n\"Except Julia,\" said Proteus.\n\n\"Dear boy,\" said Valentine, \"Julia is not excepted; but I will grant that she alone is worthy\nto bear my lady's train.\"\n\n\"Your bragging astounds me,\" said Proteus.\n\nBut he had seen Silvia, and he felt suddenly that the yellow-haired Julia was black in comparison.\nHe became in thought a villain without delay, and said to himself what he had never said before--\"I\nto myself am dearer than my friend.\"\n\nIt would have been convenient for Valentine if Proteus had changed, by the power of the god\nwhose name he bore, the shape of his body at the evil moment when he despised Julia in admiring\nSilvia. But his body did not change; his smile was still affectionate, and Valentine confided\nto him the great secret that Silvia had now promised to run away with him. \"In the pocket of\nthis cloak,\" said Valentine, \"I have a silken rope ladder, with hooks which will clasp the\nwindow-bar of her room.\"\n\nProteus knew the reason why Silvia and her lover were bent on flight. The Duke intended her\nto wed Sir Thurio, a gentlemanly noodle for whom she did not care a straw.\n\nProteus thought that if he could get rid of Valentine he might make Silvia fond of him, especially\nif the Duke insisted on her enduring Sir Thurio's tiresome chatter. He therefore went to the\nDuke, and said, \"Duty before friendship! It grieves me to thwart my friend Valentine, but your\nGrace should know that he intends to-night to elope with your Grace's daughter.\" He begged\nthe Duke not to tell Valentine the giver of this information, and the Duke assured him that\nhis name would not be divulged.\n\nEarly that evening the Duke summoned Valentine, who came to him wearing a large cloak with\na bulging pocket.\n\n\"You know,\" said the Duke, \"my desire to marry my daughter to Sir Thurio?\"\n\n\"I do,\" replied Valentine. \"He is virtuous and generous, as befits a man so honored in your\nGrace's thoughts.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless she dislikes him,\" said the Duke. \"She is a peevish, proud, disobedient girl,\nand I should be sorry to leave her a penny. I intend, therefore, to marry again.\"\n\nValentine bowed.\n\n\"I hardly know how the young people of to-day make love,\" continued the Duke, \"and I thought\nthat you would be just the man to teach me how to win the lady of my choice.\"\n\n\"Jewels have been known to plead rather well,\" said Valentine.\n\n\"I have tried them,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"The habit of liking the giver may grow if your Grace gives her some more.\"\n\n\"The chief difficulty,\" pursued the Duke, \"is this. The lady is promised to a young gentleman,\nand it is hard to have a word with her. She is, in fact, locked up.\"\n\n\"Then your Grace should propose an elopement,\" said Valentine. \"Try a rope ladder.\"\n\n\"But how should I carry it?\" asked the Duke.\n\n\"A rope ladder is light,\" said Valentine; \"You can carry it in a cloak.\"\n\n\"Like yours?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Grace.\"\n\n\"Then yours will do. Kindly lend it to me.\"\n\nValentine had talked himself into a trap. He could not refuse to lend his cloak, and when the\nDuke had donned it, his Grace drew from the pocket a sealed missive addressed to Silvia. He\ncoolly opened it, and read these words: \"Silvia, you shall be free to-night.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" he said, \"and here's the rope ladder. Prettily contrived, but not perfectly. I give\nyou, sir, a day to leave my dominions. If you are in Milan by this time to-morrow, you die.\"\n\nPoor Valentine was saddened to the core. \"Unless I look on Silvia in the day,\" he said, \"there\nis no day for me to look upon.\"\n\nBefore he went he took farewell of Proteus, who proved a hypocrite of the first order. \"Hope\nis a lover's staff,\" said Valentine's betrayer; \"walk hence with that.\"\n\nAfter leaving Milan, Valentine and his servant wandered into a forest near Mantua where the\ngreat poet Virgil lived. In the forest, however, the poets (if any) were brigands, who bade\nthe travelers stand. They obeyed, and Valentine made so good an impression upon his captors\nthat they offered him his life on condition that he became their captain.\n\n\"I accept,\" said Valentine, \"provided you release my servant, and are not violent to women\nor the poor.\"\n\nThe reply was worthy of Virgil, and Valentine became a brigand chief.\n\nWe return now to Julia, who found Verona too dull to live in since Proteus had gone. She begged\nher maid Lucetta to devise a way by which she could see him. \"Better wait for him to return,\"\nsaid Lucetta, and she talked so sensibly that Julia saw it was idle to hope that Lucetta would\nbear the blame of any rash and interesting adventure. Julia therefore said that she intended\nto go to Milan and dressed like a page.\n\n\"You must cut off your hair then,\" said Lucetta, who thought that at this announcement Julia\nwould immediately abandon her scheme.\n\n\"I shall knot it up,\" was the disappointing rejoinder.\n\nLucetta then tried to make the scheme seem foolish to Julia, but Julia had made up her mind\nand was not to be put off by ridicule; and when her toilet was completed, she looked as comely\na page as one could wish to see.\n\nJulia assumed the male name Sebastian, and arrived in Milan in time to hear music being performed\noutside the Duke's palace.\n\n\"They are serenading the Lady Silvia,\" said a man to her.\n\nSuddenly she heard a voice lifted in song, and she knew that voice. It was the voice of Proteus.\nBut what was he singing?\n\n   \"Who is Silvia? what is she,\n      That all our swains commend her?\n    Holy, fair, and wise is she;\n      The heaven such grace did lend her\n    That she might admired be.\"\n\nJulia tried not to hear the rest, but these two lines somehow thundered into her mind--\n\n   \"Then to Silvia let us sing;\n    She excels each mortal thing.\"\n\nThen Proteus thought Silvia excelled Julia; and, since he sang so beautifully for all the world\nto hear, it seemed that he was not only false to Julia, but had forgotten her. Yet Julia still\nloved him. She even went to him, and asked to be his page, and Proteus engaged her.\n\nOne day, he handed to her the ring which she had given him, and said, \"Sebastian, take that\nto the Lady Silvia, and say that I should like the picture of her she promised me.\"\n\nSilvia had promised the picture, but she disliked Proteus. She was obliged to talk to him because\nhe was high in the favor of her father, who thought he pleaded with her on behalf of Sir Thurio.\nSilvia had learned from Valentine that Proteus was pledged to a sweetheart in Verona; and when\nhe said tender things to her, she felt that he was disloyal in friendship as well as love.\n\nJulia bore the ring to Silvia, but Silvia said, \"I will not wrong the woman who gave it him\nby wearing it.\"\n\n\"She thanks you,\" said Julia.\n\n\"You know her, then?\" said Silvia, and Julia spoke so tenderly of herself that Silvia wished\nthat Sebastian would marry Julia.\n\nSilvia gave Julia her portrait for Proteus, who would have received it the worse for extra\ntouches on the nose and eyes if Julia had not made up her mind that she was as pretty as Silvia.\n\nSoon there was an uproar in the palace. Silvia had fled.\n\nThe Duke was certain that her intention was to join the exiled Valentine, and he was not wrong.\n\nWithout delay he started in pursuit, with Sir Thurio, Proteus, and some servants.\n\nThe members of the pursuing party got separated, and Proteus and Julia (in her page's dress)\nwere by themselves when they saw Silvia, who had been taken prisoner by outlaws and was now\nbeing led to their Captain. Proteus rescued her, and then said, \"I have saved you from death;\ngive me one kind look.\"\n\n\"O misery, to be helped by you!\" cried Silvia. \"I would rather be a lion's breakfast.\"\n\nJulia was silent, but cheerful. Proteus was so much annoyed with Silvia that he threatened\nher, and seized her by the waist.\n\n\"O heaven!\" cried Silvia.\n\nAt that instant there was a noise of crackling branches. Valentine came crashing through the\nMantuan forest to the rescue of his beloved. Julia feared he would slay Proteus, and hurried\nto help her false lover. But he struck no blow, he only said, \"Proteus, I am sorry I must never\ntrust you more.\"\n\nThereat Proteus felt his guilt, and fell on his knees, saying, \"Forgive me! I grieve! I suffer!\"\n\n\"Then you are my friend once more,\" said the generous Valentine. \"If Silvia, that is lost to\nme, will look on you with favor, I promise that I will stand aside and bless you both.\"\n\nThese words were terrible to Julia, and she swooned. Valentine revived her, and said, \"What\nwas the matter, boy?\"\n\n\"I remembered,\" fibbed Julia, \"that I was charged to give a ring to the Lady Silvia, and that\nI did not.\"\n\n\"Well, give it to me,\" said Proteus.\n\nShe handed him a ring, but it was the ring that Proteus gave to Julia before he left Verona.\n\nProteus looked at her hand, and crimsoned to the roots of his hair.\n\n\"I changed my shape when you changed your mind,\" said she.\n\n\"But I love you again,\" said he.\n\nJust then outlaws entered, bringing two prizes--the Duke and Sir Thurio.\n\n\"Forbear!\" cried Valentine, sternly. \"The Duke is sacred.\"\n\nSir Thurio exclaimed, \"There's Silvia; she's mine!\"\n\n\"Touch her, and you die!\" said Valentine.\n\n\"I should be a fool to risk anything for her,\" said Sir Thurio.\n\n\"Then you are base,\" said the Duke. \"Valentine, you are a brave man. Your banishment is over.\nI recall you. You may marry Silvia. You deserve her.\"\n\n\"I thank your Grace,\" said Valentine, deeply moved, \"and yet must ask you one more boon.\"\n\n\"I grant it,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"Pardon these men, your Grace, and give them employment. They are better than their calling.\"\n\n\"I pardon them and you,\" said the Duke. \"Their work henceforth shall be for wages.\"\n\n\"What think you of this page, your Grace?\" asked Valentine, indicating Julia.\n\nThe Duke glanced at her, and said, \"I think the boy has grace in him.\"\n\n\"More grace than boy, say I,\" laughed Valentine, and the only punishment which Proteus had\nto bear for his treacheries against love and friendship was the recital in his presence of\nthe adventures of Julia-Sebastian of Verona.\n\nALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL\n\nIn the year thirteen hundred and something, the Countess of Rousillon was unhappy in her palace\nnear the Pyrenees. She had lost her husband, and the King of France had summoned her son Bertram\nto Paris, hundreds of miles away.\n\nBertram was a pretty youth with curling hair, finely arched eyebrows, and eyes as keen as a\nhawk's. He was as proud as ignorance could make him, and would lie with a face like truth itself\nto gain a selfish end. But a pretty youth is a pretty youth, and Helena was in love with him.\n\nHelena was the daughter of a great doctor who had died in the service of the Count of Rousillon.\nHer sole fortune consisted in a few of her father's prescriptions.\n\nWhen Bertram had gone, Helena's forlorn look was noticed by the Countess, who told her that\nshe was exactly the same to her as her own child. Tears then gathered in Helena's eyes, for\nshe felt that the Countess made Bertram seem like a brother whom she could never marry. The\nCountess guessed her secret forthwith, and Helena confessed that Bertram was to her as the\nsun is to the day.\n\nShe hoped, however, to win this sun by earning the gratitude of the King of France, who suffered\nfrom a lingering illness, which made him lame. The great doctors attached to the Court despaired\nof curing him, but Helena had confidence in a prescription which her father had used with success.\n\nTaking an affectionate leave of the Countess, she went to Paris, and was allowed to see the King.\n\nHe was very polite, but it was plain he thought her a quack. \"It would not become me,\" he said,\n\"to apply to a simple maiden for the relief which all the learned doctors cannot give me.\"\n\n\"Heaven uses weak instruments sometimes,\" said Helena, and she declared that she would forfeit\nher life if she failed to make him well.\n\n\"And if you succeed?\" questioned the King.\n\n\"Then I will ask your Majesty to give me for a husband the man whom I choose!\"\n\nSo earnest a young lady could not be resisted forever by a suffering king. Helena, therefore,\nbecame the King's doctor, and in two days the royal cripple could skip.\n\nHe summoned his courtiers, and they made a glittering throng in the throne room of his palace.\nWell might the country girl have been dazzled, and seen a dozen husbands worth dreaming of\namong the handsome young noblemen before her. But her eyes only wandered till they found Bertram.\nThen she went up to him, and said, \"I dare not say I take you, but I am yours!\" Raising her\nvoice that the King might hear, she added, \"This is the Man!\"\n\n\"Bertram,\" said the King, \"take her; she's your wife!\"\n\n\"My wife, my liege?\" said Bertram. \"I beg your Majesty to permit me to choose a wife.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Bertram, what she has done for your King?\" asked the monarch, who had treated\nBertram like a son.\n\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" replied Bertram; \"but why should I marry a girl who owes her breeding\nto my father's charity?\"\n\n\"You disdain her for lacking a title, but I can give her a title,\" said the King; and as he\nlooked at the sulky youth a thought came to him, and he added, \"Strange that you think so much\nof blood when you could not distinguish your own from a beggar's if you saw them mixed together\nin a bowl.\"\n\n\"I cannot love her,\" asserted Bertram; and Helena said gently, \"Urge him not, your Majesty.\nI am glad to have cured my King for my country's sake.\"\n\n\"My honor requires that scornful boy's obedience,\" said the King. \"Bertram, make up your mind\nto this. You marry this lady, of whom you are so unworthy, or you learn how a king can hate.\nYour answer?\"\n\nBertram bowed low and said, \"Your Majesty has ennobled the lady by your interest in her. I submit.\"\n\n\"Take her by the band,\" said the King, \"and tell her she is yours.\"\n\nBertram obeyed, and with little delay he was married to Helena.\n\nFear of the King, however, could not make him a lover. Ridicule helped to sour him. A base\nsoldier named Parolles told him to his face that now he had a \"kicky-wicky\" his business was\nnot to fight but to stay at home. \"Kicky-wicky\" was only a silly epithet for a wife, but it\nmade Bertram feel he could not bear having a wife, and that he must go to the war in Italy,\nthough the King had forbidden him."}
{"ID": 165, "text": "His appearance indicated digestive issues, which was understandable considering his habit of consuming the strange mixtures found in the garbage heap. Despite his poor physical condition, Johnny's mother doted on him and believed him to be a beautiful prince among bears. While he may have been a failure in some regards, Johnny possessed a cunning intellect, using his knowledge of how to manipulate his mother to get what he wanted.\n\nIn 1897, the narrator had a chance encounter with a mother bear and her cubs at the park. The cubs, obedient to their mother's commands, climbed a nearby tree to observe the human. Later, the narrator was directed toward the garbage heap to witness more bear activity. He found a good hiding spot in a nearby bush and observed various black bears timidly feeding on the garbage before fleeing at the slightest noise or disturbance. The narrator was fascinated by the bears and grew increasingly interested in observing their behavior in their natural habitat.Since there was no alternative, I headed to the garbage pile and dug a hole large enough to hide in. Surrounding me were piles of rotten vegetables, potato peels, tomato cans, and carcasses, creating a putrid odor. Despite the abundance of flies, I remained hidden all day, documenting every bear that approached me. Observing their individualities, it became evident that each animal is unique, just like humans. The bears' padded feet allowed them to move silently through the woods, making it challenging to detect their presence. Although the morning was uneventful, things changed in the afternoon when four large bears feasted on the garbage heap, including Fatty, who used every inch of his long tongue to reach his food. Suddenly, a large black bear named Grumpy appeared with her cub, Little Johnny, warning the group before chasing them away. Fatty was the last to leave and became the recipient of Grumpy's slaps on the rear.Left alone with the feast, Grumpy called out to her son with a whiny \"Er r r Er r r Er r r r,\" prompting Johnny to eagerly hop over on his three good legs and join her at the garbage pile. They had a good time together, with Johnny even forgetting to complain. He seemed to know the canned goods well, avoiding lobster tins and focusing on those that once held jam. However, some cans were challenging for him, and he got stuck with his head in one, requiring his mother's help to get free. He also enjoyed a syrup can, using his arm to reach the syrup and licking it clean. When he found a mouse trap, he inspected it carefully before punishing it and finding a piece of cheese inside. Johnny's disregard for ptomaine poisoning was evident as he ate various canned foods and grew plump from the feasting. \n\nAs the author realized the danger of being near a grumpy mother bear and her cub with a large garbage pile between them, Johnny spotted a huge grizzly bear in the distance. The mother bear growled and stood up defensively while Johnny hid behind her. The Grizzly Bear approached them with a powerful presence, causing the author and the mother bear's hair to stand on end.As Johnny's whining grew louder, I found myself sympathizing with him, but didn't vocalize my feelings. Grumpy turned to her cub and made a series of cough-like sounds, likely instructing him to climb up a nearby tree for safety while she dealt with their unwelcome guest. However, Johnny had other plans and climbed to the top of the tree to watch the action unfold. The branch he was perched on swayed under his weight, causing me to fear it would snap and result in injury. Meanwhile, Grumpy bravely charged at the Grizzly while Johnny cheered her on from his spot in the treetop. The two beasts engaged in a fierce battle, but Grumpy was ultimately overpowered by her larger opponent. After the Grizzly knocked her to the ground, she attempted to flee, only to be pursued by her furious assailant. Eventually, Grumpy managed to make her way up the tree where Johnny was waiting for her. I attempted to get a closer look with my camera, but Grumpy became agitated with my presence and began to threaten me.As I hesitated uncertainly, a voice called out to me from behind: \"Hey there, Mister! You better be careful, that bear up there might hurt you.\" I turned to see a cowboy from the hotel on his horse, having come upon the scene quite by chance. \"Do you know these bears?\" I asked him. \"I reckon I do,\" he replied. \"The one up top is Johnny. He's a little crazy. And that big one is Grumpy. She's quite unstable, but she always gets angry when Johnny makes noise like that.\"\n\n\"I'd like to take a picture of her when she comes down,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, I'll stay here on my horse,\" replied the cowboy. \"If she comes after you, I'll keep her away.\"\n\nAnd so, we waited as Grumpy slowly made her way down from the tree, growling and menacing us. But as she drew closer to the ground, she simply ran off into the woods, leaving us alone with Johnny once more. I readied my camera and began to snap pictures of the whining bear in his favorite pose. Suddenly, he began to crane his neck and yell, just as he had during his fight with Grumpy.\n\nLooking where he pointed, I saw the enormous Grizzly barreling toward me. I asked the cowboy if he knew this bear, and he replied, \"That's the ole Grizzly. He's the biggest bear in the park. He usually minds his own business, but he's just been in a fight so he might be angry.\"\n\n\"I want to take his picture,\" I said. \"Are you willing to help me?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said with a grin. \"I'll stay on my horse and if he charges, I'll charge him. But I can only knock him down once, so pick your tree carefully.\"\n\nI didn't relish the thought of climbing up into Johnny's tree, only to have the angry Grizzly waiting below. As the bear approached, I took several shots with my camera, but he continued to come closer and closer. Finally, at just five yards away, he stopped and swung his head to one side, giving me a view of his profile. I took a picture, but as soon as the camera clicked, he let out a growl that shook me to my core. After a tense moment, he lost interest in us and began rooting through the garbage cans.\n\nI backed away slowly, leaving him to his meal and Johnny to his whining."}

{"ID": 33, "text": "The passage from John 1:1-18 speaks of Jesus as the source of all life and vitality, illuminating all aspects of human experience. His spirit is described as one of light, with a keen discernment of the true nature of things. This spirit is also the source of divine holiness, capable of destroying all that is evil and creating a deep fellowship among humanity. As believers, we are called to remember our kinship with Jesus, and to emulate his example of emptying oneself in order to serve the weak and needy.They are attracted to luxury and comfort, seeking to insulate themselves from the hardships of life.They may be pampered and pampering, forgetting that true growth often comes through struggle and challenge.And then there are those who are like John the Baptist.Asked what manner of man he was, Jesus replied that he was a prophet, and more than a prophet.John was not swayed by public opinion.He lived a simple life free from material pleasures.He spoke truth boldly, regardless of the consequences.He was a voice in the wilderness, preparing the way for the coming of the Lord.Which manner of man will I choose to be?The desert reed, the one clothed in soft raiment, or the prophet who fearlessly proclaims the truth?May my heart be open to the leading of the Holy Spirit, empowering me to live a life that speaks of love, humility, and truth.He deliberately seeks them out and prepares them for their callings.Simon was to become Peter, the rock on which the Church is built.And so our Lord prepares him with a new name, and hints at what he will become.And similarly, with the others He calls, He prepares them for their unique callings.Nathanael, too, is given a glimpse of his role as a true Israelite in whom there is no guile.Our Lord does not merely call us; He also prepares and equips us for our callings.He gives us glimpses of our potential, and hints at what we can become if we follow Him.We must be attentive and receptive to His preparations for us, and trust in His guiding hand.He knows us better than we know ourselves, and He is faithful to complete the good work He has begun in us.Our Lord is the ultimate strategist, and His plans for us are perfect.May we trust in Him completely and follow His leadings.Before calling His servant to service, God prepares them in secret. He knows all about us, just as He knew Simon, who would become Peter. Nathanael was also known to Him, even in his secret meditation under a fig tree. Our Lord chooses unlikely individuals, such as fishermen, for His service and sees their potential where others may not. The daily cross may seem like a burden, but in bearing it, we find strength and renew our souls. This is the heartening paradox of grace."}

In all cases, an\nintense blue colour was obtained on adding ferric chloride, a slight\nprecipitate only was obtained with aniline hydrochloride, and bromine\nwas rapidly absorbed with the separation of an insoluble white deposit.\n\nThe condensation products obtained by the interaction of dilute\nsolutions of phenolsulphonic acid and formaldehyde at moderately high\ntemperature, which form slimy masses and are insoluble in water, are\nsoluble in alcohol. An alcoholic solution of such a product was used in\na tanning experiment, and a piece of pelt immersed in the solution was\ntanned through in a few days; the resultant leather being rather firm,\nspringy, and slightly hard, and the colour was a light brownish-grey.\n\nAll those condensation products which are easily or partly soluble in\nalcohol dissolve in caustic soda, sodium carbonate, in some cases also\nin borax and sodium sulphite. They are rendered soluble with greater\nease when the _freshly prepared_ solution is heated on the water bath\nwith the alkali; the alkaline solution, neutralised as far as is\npossible with acetic acid, yields light brown coloured solutions, the\ntanning effects of which have proved very satisfactory. Leathers tanned\nin such solutions, however, are rather empty and hard, possess but\nlittle resilience and an uneven, dirty greyish-brown colour.\n\nA sample of such a product, as nearly as possible neutralised with\nacetic acid, contained 14.8 per cent. tanning matters, by the shake\nmethod of analysis.\n\n\nB. Condensation of Partly Neutralised Phenolsulphonic Acid\n\nAttempts were made at condensing partly neutralised phenolsulphonic\nacid; the latter was obtained by mixing equal quantities of\nphenolsulphonic acid and sodium phenolsulphonate (prepared by exactly\nneutralising phenolsulphonic acid with a concentrated solution of\ncaustic soda).\n\nThe consequent dilution and decrease in acidity, however, considerably\ndiminished the velocity of the reaction. Hence, if the half-neutralised\nSolution A1 (_cf_. p. 98) is diluted with water, taking equal volumes,\nand one-sixth of the volume of dilute formaldehyde (1:3) gradually added\nin the cold, condensation is not induced."}

Then some provisions were put into the boats,\nand the captain divided the whole company among the three boats.\n\n\"Let us stay together, captain,\" pleaded Dick. \"We can row.\"\n\n\"And what of the girls, Rover?\"\n\n\"Let us go with the Rover boys,\" pleaded Dora, and Nellie and Grace\nsaid the same. Old Jerry also stood by his friends.\n\nWhile this talk was going on there was a rush for two of the boats,\nand before Captain Blossom could do anything his men were off, taking\nJack Lesher and Dan Baxter with them.\n\n\"You can go down with the ship!\" cried Dan Baxter mockingly. An\ninstant later the darkness hid the speaker from view.\n\n\"They have left us,\" cried Captain Blossom. \"But, thank fortune, the\nbest and largest boat is also left.\"\n\nSome provisions had been tumbled into this boat, and a cask of water\nfollowed. Then the girls were placed on board, the Rover boys followed,\nand the captain and old Jerry came behind, to cut away. Down went\nthe small boat into the mighty waves, and each of the boys caught up\nan oar.\n\n\"Pull!\" roared Captain Blossom. \"Pull for your lives!\" And they did\npull, two boys on one side, and Sam and old Jerry on the other. The\ngirls huddled in the stern, expecting every moment to see the little\ncraft turn bottom side up. They scraped along the side of the doomed\nship, and then along some rocks. Captain Blossom was in the bow,\npeering ahead.\n\n\"To the left!\" he yelled. \"Quick!\" And then came a shock, and the\ncaptain disappeared beneath the waves.\n\n\"The captain is gone!\" screamed Dora, but she was hardly heard, for\nthe ship was pounding on the rocks, and the spray was flying in all\ndirections. The boys and old Jerry continued to pull, knowing not\nwhat else to do, and at last the spot was left behind and they found\nthemselves on the bosom of the mighty Pacific, in the black darkness,\nout of sight of everything, with only the sounds of the wind and the\nwaves filling their ears.\n\n\"Do you think we will ever get out of this alive?\" asked Grace of Dora.\n\n\"Let us pray that we may all be spared,\" answered Dora, and they did\npray, more earnestly than they had ever before prayed in their whole\nlives. It was a moment that put their faith to a supreme test.\n\nThe boys did not dare to stop rowing, and they kept on until their\nbacks ached and their arms seemed ready to drop from their sockets.\n\n\"We had better take turns,\" said Dick, at last. \"We can't keep this\nup all night..\" And his suggestion was followed out, two, rowing at\na time, for a space of fifteen or twenty minutes.\n\nThey thought they might see something of the other boats, but nothing\ncame to view, and when they set up a shout at the top of their lungs,\nno answer came back.\n\n\"They have either gone down or else got out of this neighborhood,\"\nsaid Tom.\n\n\"It was too bad to lose Captain Blossom,\" said Sam. \"He was not such\na bad sort, after all.\"\n\nIt was not long after this that a mass of wreckage drifted past\nthem. There was a bit of broken spar and some other woodwork, but no\nhuman being, and they let the wreckage go.\n\nBy looking at his watch Dick saw that it was three o'clock in the\nmorning.\n\n\"It will be light in another couple of hours,\" he said. \"If we can\nkeep on top of the waves until then perhaps we can sight the islands\nthe captain mentioned.\"\n\n\"I wish it was daylight now,\" sighed Nellie.\n\nFortunately a bundle of clothing had been brought along, and as the\nwater was warm, nobody suffered much from the wetting received. Care\nwas taken to keep the provisions as dry as possible, for there was\nno telling how long it would be before they would be able to get more.\n\nSlowly the night dragged by, and, with the coming of morning, the\nwind went down, the storm passing to the northward.\n\n\"It is growing lighter,\" announced Dora. \"The sunlight is beginning\nto, show over the rim of the sea.\"\n\nHalf an hour later the sun came up, like a great ball of fire from\na bath in the ocean, capping the high waves with gold. As the light\nspread around them, Dick stood up on a seat and gazed eagerly in all\ndirections.\n\n\"What do you see?\" demanded the others.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he answered, with a sinking heart; \"nothing but water on\nall sides of us.\"\n\n\"The islands--they must be somewhere!\" cried Tom, and he, too, took\na look, followed by the others. The last to look was old Jerry.\n\n\"Can't see much,\" said the old sailor slowly. \"But I kind of reckon\nthere's a dark spot directly southward.\"\n\n\"It must be one of the islands the captain mentioned!\" exclaimed Dora.\n\n\"We might as well row in that direction,\" said Dick. \"There is nothing\nelse to do.\"\n\n\"It's queer what became of the other boats,\" said Sam.\n\nSome of the provisions were brought forth and they ate sparingly,\nand drank a little of the water. Then the boys and old Jerry took up\nthe oars once more and began to pull as nearly southward as they\ncould make it, steering by the sun.\n\nWhen the sun grew higher it became very warm, so that the rowers were\nglad enough to lay aside their jackets. By noon they reckoned that\nthey had covered six or eight miles. One after another stood up on\nthe seats to take a look around.\n\n\"Nothing in sight yet,\" said Dick, with a sorry shake of his head.\n\"We must have been mistaken in that dark spot.\"\n\n\"What will you do now?\" asked Grace. \"The hot sun is beginning to\nmake my head ache.\"\n\nSam's head also ached, but he said nothing. Nobody knew what to suggest.\n\n\"One thing is certain; we can't remain out on the bosom of the ocean,\"\nsaid Dick.\n\n\"Better continue to pull southward,\" came from old Jerry. \"There are\nlots of islands down that way. The map is full of 'em.\"\n\n\"Yes, the map is full of them,\" answered Dick. \"But a quarter of an\ninch on the map means a hundred miles or two in reality.\"\n\nYet it was decided to row on, trusting to luck to strike some island,\neither large or small. It was now fiercely hot, and all hands perspired\nfreely.\n\nBy the end of the afternoon the boys were worn out, and had to give\nup rowing. The girls were dozing in the stern, having covered their\nheads with a thin shawl, stretched from one gunwale to another. Tom\nand Sam were dizzy from the glare of the sun on the water.\n\n\"Another day like this will set me crazy,\" said the youngest Rover.\n\"I'd give ten dollars for a pair of blue goggles.\"\n\nOld Jerry had been looking intently to the westward. Now he pointed\nin that direction.\n\n\"See that trail of smoke,\" he said. \"Unless I am mistaken a steamship\nis sailing toward us!\"\n\n\"A steamship!\" cried Tom, and the words awoke the girls. \"We must\nhail the vessel by all means.\"\n\n\"If she comes close enough,\" said Captain Jerry pointedly. \"Don't be\ntoo hopeful, my lads. She may pass us by.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE CRUSOES OF SEVEN ISLANDS\n\n\nAll on board of the rowboat watched the thin trail of smoke with\ninterest.\n\n\"I believe it is going away from us,\" said Dora.\n\n\"No, it is coming closer,\" said Nellie.\n\n\"It is certainly moving to the northward,\" put in Sam.\n\nA quarter of an hour went by and the smoke came only a little nearer.\n\n\"She is a big steamer,\" said Captain Jerry. \"But she aint comin' jest\nthis way.\"\n\n\"You are sure?\" cried Tom.\n\n\"Yes, lad. It's too bad, but it can't be helped.\"\n\nThe old sailor was right; half an hour later the smoke had shifted,\nand after that it faded gradually from sight.\n\nIt was a heavy blow, after their expectations had been raised so\nhigh, and tears stood in the eyes of all of the girls, while the boys\nlooked unusually sober.\n\nWhat was to do next? All asked that question, yet it was only Captain\nJerry who answered it.\n\n\"Let us pull southward,\" said he.\n\nAnd they did so, although with hearts that were as heavy as lead in\ntheir bosoms.\n\nSlowly the night came on. Shortly after the sun set the moon showed\nitself and the sky became studded with stars, the Southern Cross\nstanding out boldly among them. The pale light made the bosom of the\nocean glisten like silver.\n\n\"A beautiful night,\" said Dora. \"But who can enjoy it when we do not\nknow what to-morrow will bring forth,\" and she sighed deeply.\n\nThe boys and old Jerry continued to take turns at rowing, while the\ngirls sank into fitful slumber.\n\nPresently the old sailor raised his head.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said, and they did so, and far away heard a strange booming.\n\n\"What's that?\" questioned Sam.\n\n\"It's breakers!\" cried Tom. \"We must be near some coast!\"\n\n\"The lad is right,\" came from Captain Jerry. \"We are near an island,\nafter all!\"\n\nDick stood on a seat, and, as the boat rode to the top of a wave,\ntook a look around.\n\n\"An island!\" he cried. \"Dead ahead!\"\n\n\"Hurrah! We are saved!\" ejaculated Sam. \"What is the matter?\" questioned\nDora, rousing up, followed by the other girls.\n\n\"There is an island ahead.\"\n\n\"We must be careful how we approach the shore, lads,\" cautioned Jerry.\n\"If we strike the rocks, it may cost us our lives. Perhaps we had\nbetter hold off until daylight.\"\n\n\"I see a stretch of sand!\" came from Tom, who was standing up. \"If\nwe can reach that, we'll be all right.\"\n\nOld Jerry took a careful look. The sand was there, true enough, but\nthere were dangerous breakers between the boat and that shore.\n\n\"If you say so, we can run our chances,\" he said. \"The young ladies\nmust hold tight, and not mind a good ducking.\"\n\nThe force of the waves was now carrying them closer and closer to\nthe breakers. Under old Jerry's directions the boys took a short,\nsharp stroke, keeping the rowboat straight up to the waves. The noise\nwas like thunder, and soon the spray was flying all over them.\n\n\"Now pull!\" cried Captain Jerry. \"One, two, three! Hold tight, girls!\"\nAnd away they went into the breakers. One wave dashed over the craft,\nbut it was not swamped, and before another could hit them they darted\nup a swell and onto a long, sandy beach.\n\nIn a twinkle the old sailor was out, along with Dick, and, aided by\nanother wave, they ran the boat well up the beach, out of the harm\nof the waves. It was a hard struggle, and when it was over Dick sank\ndown almost exhausted.\n\n\"Saved!\" murmured Dora, as she leaped out on shore. \"Thank Heaven!\"\nAnd all of the others echoed the sentiment.\n\nThe empty boat was pulled up out of harm's way and chained fast to\na palm tree growing near, and then the party of seven sat down to\nrest and to talk over the new condition of affairs. They were on a\nwild, tropical coast, with a long, sandy beach running to the ocean,\nand back of this a dense mass of tropical vegetation, including palms,\nplantains, cocoanuts, and date trees. Back of the heavy growth was\na distant hill, standing out dimly in the moonlight.\n\n\"This looks like a regular Crusoe-like island,\" said Dora, as she\ngazed around. \"There is not a sign of a habitation anywhere.\"\n\n\"A good many of the South Sea islands are not inhabited,\" said Dick.\n\"The natives won't live on them because they are subject to volcano\neruptions, earthquakes, and tidal waves.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope we don't have any of those things while we stay here,\" came\nfrom Nellie. \"An earthquake would scare me almost to death.\"\n\n\"I do not see that we can do better than to stay right here for the\nrest of the night,\" said Tom. \"I am too tired out to walk very, far.\"\n\nIt was decided to follow Tom's advice, and all made themselves as\ncomfortable as circumstances permitted. They had some matches in a\nwaterproof safe, and soon a camp-fire was started, at which they\ndried some of their garments. Then, after eating some of the provisions\nthat were left, they laid down to rest. Strange as it may seem all\nslept soundly until sunrise, and nothing came to disturb them.\n\nWhen the girls arose they found the boys and Captain Jerry already\npreparing breakfast. On the shore Tom, had found some oysters and\nshell-fish, and these were baking. Among the provisions were a little\ntea and coffee, and old Jerry had made a pot of coffee, which did\none good to smell. Sam had brought down some cocoanuts from a nearby\ntree, and also found some ripe bananas.\n\n\"We won't starve' to death here, that's certain,\" said Dick, when\nthey all sat down to eat. \"The island is full of good things. If I\nhad a gun I could bring down lots of birds, and monkeys, too.\"\n\n\"I don't think I'd care to eat a monkey,\" said Grace. \"But I wouldn't\nmind eating birds.\"\n\n\"There must be plenty of fish here, too,\" said Tom. \"In fact I saw\nsome sporting in the waters of a little bay up the coast.\"\n\n\"Shall we go up and down the coast after breakfast?\" asked Sam.\n\n\"My advice is to climb yonder hill and take a squint around,\" came\nfrom Captain Jerry.\n\n\"That's a splendid idea, providing we can get to the tap,\" said Dick.\n\n\"There is no use of all of us going, lad. You can go with me while\nthe rest stay here.\"\n\n\"What shall we do in the meantime?\" asked Sam.\n\n\"Better try your hand at fishin', lad, and see if you can knock some\nbirds over with sticks and stones. If ye get anything, let the girls\ncook us somethin', for we'll be powerful hungry by the time we get back.\"\n\nHalf an hour later Captain Jerry and Dick set out. Each carried a\nfew ship's biscuits and also a heavy stick which had been cut in the\nthickets. Each wished he had a gun or a pistol, but those articles\nwere not to be had.\n\nThe climb up the hill was by no means an easy one. The rocks were\nrough and in many spots the jungle of brush and vines was so thick\nthat to get through was next to impossible. It was very warm, and\nthey had to stop often to cool off and catch their breath.\n\n\"I don't wonder that people in hot countries move slowly,\" said Dick.\n\"I feel more like resting than doing anything else.\"\n\nIt was almost noon when they came in sight of the top of the hill.\nThere were still some rough rocks to climb, and these they had to\nascend by means of some vines that grew handy.\n\n\"What a magnificent view!\" cried Dick.\n\nIt certainly was magnificent. Looking back in the direction they had\ncome they could see the Pacific Ocean, glittering in the bright\nsun-light and stretching miles and miles out of sight.\n\nThe island they were on looked to be about half a mile in diameter.\nNorthward, eastward, and westward was the ocean, but to the southward\nwas a circlet of six islands, having a stretch of calm water between\nthem. Between some of the islands the water was very shallow, while\nelsewhere it looked deep.\n\n\"Seven islands in all,\" said old Jerry. \"And not a sign of a house\nor hut anywhere.\"\n\n\"We are the Crusoes of Seven Islands,\" said Dick. \"But do you really\nbelieve they are uninhabited?\"\n\n\"Do ye see any signs of life, lad?\"\n\n\"I must say I do not. It's queer, too, for I rather imagined one at\nleast of the other boats had reached this place.\"\n\n\"I thought the same. But it looks now as if they all went to Davy\nJones's locker, eh?\"\n\n\"It certainly does look that way.\"\n\nFrom the top of the hill they took a careful survey of the situation.\nThe elevation was in the very center of the island. Down toward the\nother islands the slope was more abrupt than it was in the direction\nfrom which they had come.\n\n\"We can take a look at those other islands later on,\" said old Jerry.\n\"Reckon as how we have done enough for one day. If we don't git back\nsoon, they'll become anxious about us.\"\n\n\"I wish we had a flag,\" said Dick. \"Here is a tall tree. We could\nchop away the top branches and hang up a signal of distress. If we\ndid that, perhaps some ship would come this way and rescue us.\"\n\n\"Right ye are, lad, but it aint many ships come this way. They are\nafraid o' the rocks we run on.\"\n\nHaving looked around once more, to \"git the lay o' the land,\" as\nCaptain Jerry expressed it, they started to descend the hill. This\nproved as difficult as climbing up had been.\n\nDick went in advance, and was half-way down when he stepped on a\nloose stick and went rolling into a perfect network of vines and\nbrushwood.\n\n\"Are ye hurt?\" sang out old Jerry.\n\n\"No--not much!\" answered the eldest Rover. \"But my wind--Oh, goodness\ngracious!\"\n\nDick broke off short, and small wonder. As 'he arose from the hole\ninto which he had tumbled, a hissing sound caught his ears. Then up\ncame the head of a snake at least eight feet long, and in a twinkle\nthe reptile had wound itself around the boy's lower limbs!\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nSETTLING DOWN ON THE ISLAND\n\n\n\"What's wrong, lad?\"\n\n\"A snake! It has wound itself around my legs!\"\n\n\"Ye don't say!\" gasped Captain Jerry, and then leaped down to the\nhollow. \"Well, by gosh! Take that, ye beast!\"\n\n\"That\" was a blow aimed at the reptile's head with the sailor's stick.\nOld Jerry's aim was both swift and true and the head of the reptile\nreceived a blow which knocked out one eye and bruised its fang. But\nthe body wound itself around Dick tighter than ever.\n\nFortunately the youth had not lost his wits completely, and as the\nneck of the reptile came up, he grasped it in his hand with the\nstrongest grip he could command.\n\n\"Cut it--cut its head off!\" he panted. \"Get your pocket-knife!\"\n\nAt once Captain Jerry dropped his stick and pulled out his jack-knife,\na big affair, such as many old sailors carry. One pull opened the\nmain blade, and then old Jerry started in to do as Dick had suggested.\nIt was no easy job and the body of the snake squirmed and whipped in\nevery direction, lashing each on the neck and the cheek. But the head\ncame off at last and then they left the body where it fell, and leaped\nout of the way of further danger.\n\n\"A close shave, lad,\" said the old sailor, as he peered around for\nmore snakes.\n\n\"I--I should sa--say it wa--was,\" panted Dick. He was deadly pale.\n\"I--I thought it would strangle me sure!\"\n\n\"If it had got around your neck, that is what would have happened.\nReckon as how we had better git out o' this neighborhood, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, let us go at once,\" and Dick started off once more.\n\nAfter that both were very careful where they stepped and kept their\neyes wide open for any new danger which might arise. So they went on\nuntil they came in sight of the seashore.\n\n\"We had better say nothing about the snake,\" said the eldest Rover.\n\"It will only scare the girls to death.\"\n\n\"No, lad, you are wrong. We must warn them of danger. Otherwise they\nmay run into it headlong.\"\n\nAll of the others were glad to have them back and plied them with\nquestions.\n\n\"So there are seven islands,\" said Tom. \"Well, as there are seven of\nus, that is one island apiece. I don't think we need complain,\" and\nhis jolly manner made all laugh.\n\nWhen Jerry told the story about the snake Dora set up a scream.\n\n\"Oh, Dick, if it had really strangled you!\" she gasped. \"You must be\nvery, very careful in the future!\"\n\n\"Yes, and you must be careful, too, Dora,\" he answered.\n\n\"There is a nice beach right around the edge of the island,\" said\nold Jerry. \"So, when we want to visit the other islands, we can walk\naround on the sand. That is better than climbing the hill.\"\n\n\"But the beach doesn't run to the other islands, does it?\" asked Sam.\n\n\"No, but we can carry our rowboat around with us, to that bay between\nthe islands. There the water is smooth enough for anybody to row in.\"\n\n\"The six islands are shaped exactly like a ring,\" said Dick. \"And\nthis island is the big stone on top.\"\n\n\"As the island is uninhabited I suppose we'll have to settle down\nand build ourselves huts or something,\" came from Nellie.\n\n\"To be sure. We'll be regular Robinson Crusoes,\" answered Tom. \"Why,\nI can tell you it will be jolly, when we get used to it.\"\n\n\"Where will we build our huts?\" asked Sam.\n\n\"We can build them here, if we wish,\" replied Dick. \"But I rather\nfavor the side fronting the other islands.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the best side,\" said Captain Jerry. \"If we build here,\na strong storm may knock our huts flat. That side is more sheltered\nand, consequently, safer. Besides, there is more fruit there, and\nI'm sure better fishing in the bay, and that's what counts, too.\"\n\n\"Of course it counts--since we must live on fruits, fish, and what\nbirds and animals we manage to knock over,\" said Tom.\n\nThe boys had been fairly successful in hunting and fishing, having\nknocked over half a dozen birds and caught four fair-sized fish.\nEverything had been done to a turn over the camp-fire, and Dick and\nold Jerry did full justice to what was set before them--on some dried\npalm leaves Nellie had found. Their coffee they drank out of some\ncocoanut shells. They had no forks, but used sharp sticks instead,\nand the knives the boys carried in their pockets.\n\nThe weather continued fine and that night the moon shone as brightly\nas ever. The boys took a stroll on the beach to talk over their plans.\n\n\"I am sorry to say there is no telling how long we may have to stay\nhere,\" said Dick. \"It may be a day, a week, or for years.\"\n\n\"Oh, some ship is bound to pick us up some day,\" returned Tom. \"And\nif we can find enough to live on in the meantime, what is the use of\ncomplaining? I am glad my life was spared.\"\n\n\"So am I, Tom.\"\n\n\"I would like to know what became of Dan Baxter,\" put in Sam. \"Can\nit be possible that all of the rest perished?\"\n\n\"Certainly it is possible, Sam. You know what a time we had of it.\"\n\n\"It is an awful death to die--in the midst of the ocean,\" and the\nyoungest Rover shuddered.\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said Tom. \"But I am more sorry for Captain Blossom\nthan for Baxter.\"\n\n\"The wrecking of the ship was the fault of the mate. He was drunk,\"\nsaid Dick. \"The man at the wheel was doing what was right until Jack\nLesher came along.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess the mate went down with the rest.\"\n\n\"Look!\" cried Sam, pointing to sea. \"I see something dark on the water.\"\n\nAll gazed in the direction he pointed out and made out a mass of\nwreckage. They watched it steadily until the breakers cast it almost\nat their feet.\n\n\"Some wreckage from the ship!\" cried Dick, on examination. \"See, here\nis the name on some of the woodwork. I reckon the vessel went to\npieces on the rocks.\"\n\nThe wreckage consisted mainly of broken spars and cordage. But there\nwere also some boxes, which, on being opened, proved to contain\nprovisions.\n\n\"It's not such a bad find, after all,\" said Tom. \"I hope some more\ncomes ashore.\" But though they waited the best part of the night,\nnothing more came to view.\n\nIn the morning the boys felt tired and they did not rouse up until\nnearly noon. They found old Jerry at the beach, inspecting the wreckage.\n\n\"The ropes may come in handy,\" he said. \"But the wood is of small\naccount, since' we have all we want already to hand.\"\n\nIt was decided to remain at the beach for the next day, to look for\nmore wreckage. But none came in, and then they started in a body to\nskirt the shore around to the South Bay, as old Jerry called it. At\nfirst they thought to carry the boat around, but concluded to come\nback for that later.\n\nIt was a journey full of interest, for the sandy beach was dotted\nwith many strange and beautiful seashells, and just back of the sand\nwas the rich tropical growth already mentioned. The woods were full\nof monkeys and birds, and once Tom thought he caught sight of some\ngoats or deer.\n\nThey reached an ideal spot fronting the little bay a little before\nnoon, and then the girls were glad enough to sit down in the shade\nand rest. The bay was full of fish, and before long they had caught\nthree of the finny tribe. Fruit was also to be had in plenty, and a\nspring of fresh water gushed from the rocks of the hill behind them.\n\n\"This is certainly a beautiful place,\" murmured Dora, as she gazed\naround. \"Were it not for the folks at home worrying about us, I could\nspend quite some time here and enjoy it.\"\n\n\"Well, as our situation cannot be helped, let us make the best of\nit,\" said Dick cheerfully. \"There is no use in being downhearted when\nwe ought to be glad that we were saved.\"\n\nClose to the rocks they found several trees growing in something of\ntwo circles, and they decided that these trees should form the corner\nposts of a double house or cabin.\n\n\"If we had an ax we might cut down some wood, but as it is we will\nhave to use strong vines and cover the huts with palm leaves,\" said\nCaptain Jerry.\n\nThe boys were soon at work, cutting the vines and gathering the palm\nleaves, and the girls assisted as well as they were able in fastening\nup the vine-ropes and binding in the leaves. It was slow work, yet\nby nightfall one half the house was complete and the other had the\nroof covered.\n\n\"Now, if rain comes, we can keep fairly dry,\" said Tom.\n\nIt rained the very next day and they were glad enough to crowd into\nthe completed part, while the rain came down in torrents. When the\nworst of the downpour was over the wind arose and it kept blowing\nfiercely all of the afternoon and the night.\n\n\"We can be thankful we are sheltered by the hill,\" said Sam. \"Were\nwe on the other side of the island, the wind would knock the hut flat\nand drench us in no time.\"\n\nThe storm kept all awake until early morning and when it went down\nthey were glad to sink to rest. All slept soundly and it was not\nuntil ten o'clock, when the sun was struggling through the clouds,\nthat Tom arose, to find the others still slumbering.\n\n\"I'll let them sleep,\" he said to himself \"They need it and there\nis no need for them get to up.\"\n\nStretching himself, he walked quietly from the hut and down to the\nbeach. His first thought was to try to collect some wood, more or\nless dry, and start a fire.\n\nGazing across the bay to one of the other islands, he saw a sight\nwhich filled him with astonishment. There, on the beach of the island,\nlay the wreck of the _Golden Wave_.\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nANOTHER CASTAWAY BROUGHT TO LIGHT\n\n\n\"The _Golden Wave_! Hurrah!\"\n\nTom could not resist setting up a shout when he saw the familiar hull\nof the schooner, resting quietly on the beach of an island on the\nother side of the bay."}
{"ID": 239, "text": "But come, let us be off, and give some of\nthe girls a swing.'\n\n\"It was rare fun swinging the girls; the hesitation with which each one seated herself, the\ninjunction not to be sent 'too high;' the terrified scream given when sent off, the flutter\nof the light dress and the streaming of the curls in the wind, were things worth remembering.\nWhen tired with swinging, we started a game of kiss-in-the-ring, in which all heartily joined,\nexcept a few languid, swellish-looking fellows who thought it beneath their dignity, and begged\nto be excused, saying the game was 'too vulgar.'\n\n\"'Don't think of those noodles,' said the elder Aveling; 'it is not because the game is \"too\nvulgar,\" but because they have tight boots, and can't run. Come along, it's rare fun!'\n\n\"We had tea in the marquee; no end of cake and fruit, and jam and preserves. It looked, and\nwas, a little different to school-fare: no one was stinted, and the good things disappeared\nlike magic; indeed he must have been a clever magician who could have made them vanish as quickly.\nTwo or three of the youngsters had smothered their faces all over with marmalade and jam, and\nwere sights to behold. One cried because he could not eat any more of the nice things.\n\n\"'It strikes me very forcibly,' whispered the younger Aveling, 'that that youngster over there\nwill find himself under the necessity of having an additional spoonful of jam with a powder\nin it to-morrow.'\n\n\"After tea, when it was dark, there was a dance on the lawn by torchlight, the torches being\nheld by the servants; the music consisted of a flute, cornet, and violin, but the cornet proved\nof no use, as some urchin had bunged it up with a cork before the dance commenced. No particular\ndances were called for; the musicians played just what they chose, the dancers danced whatever\nthey knew best. Some, and these were the majority, knew nothing of dancing whatever, but threw\ntheir legs about just as fancy suggested; nevertheless the pleasure derived from this singular\nand altogether unique method of performing, was as intense as if done in the most scientific\nand approved manner.\n\n\"We had supper in the large dining-hall. Such a spread! It did one's heart good merely to see\nit.

{"ID": 746, "text": "The latter displayed\ngreat earnestness to proceed instantly to the attack, Evan Dhu urging to Fergus, by way of\nargument, that 'the SIDIER ROY was tottering like an egg upon a staff, and that they had a'\nthe vantage of the onset, for even a haggis (God bless her!) could charge down hill.'\n\nBut the ground through which the mountaineers must have descended, although not of great extent,\nwas impracticable in its character, being not only marshy but intersected with walls of dry\nstone, and traversed in its whole length by a very broad and deep ditch, circumstances which\nmust have given the musketry of the regulars dreadful advantages before the mountaineers could\nhave used their swords, on which they were taught to rely. The authority of the commanders\nwas therefore interposed to curb the impetuosity of the Highlanders, and only a few marksmen\nwere sent down the descent to skirmish with the enemy's advanced posts and to reconnoitre the\nground.\n\nHere, then, was a military spectacle of no ordinary interest or usual occurrence. The two armies,\nso different in aspect and discipline, yet each admirably trained in its own peculiar mode\nof war, upon whose conflict the temporary fate at least of Scotland appeared to depend, now\nfaced each other like two gladiators in the arena, each meditating upon the mode of attacking\ntheir enemy. The leading officers and the general's staff of each army could be distinguished\nin front of their lines, busied with spy-glasses to watch each other's motions, and occupied\nin despatching the orders and receiving the intelligence conveyed by the aides-de-camp and\norderly men, who gave life to the scene by galloping along in different directions, as if the\nfate of the day depended upon the speed of their horses. The space between the armies was at\ntimes occupied by the partial and irregular contest of individual sharp-shooters, and a hat\nor bonnet was occasionally seen to fall, as a wounded man was borne off by his comrades. These,\nhowever, were but trifling skirmishes, for it suited the views of neither party to advance\nin that direction. From the neighbouring hamlets the peasantry cautiously showed themselves,\nas if watching the issue of the expected engagement; and at no great distance in the bay were\ntwo square-rigged vessels, bearing the English flag, whose tops and yards were crowded with\nless timid spectators.\n\nWhen this awful pause had lasted for a short time, Fergus, with another chieftain, received\norders to detach their clans towards the village of Preston, in order to threaten the right\nflank of Cope's army and compel him to a change of position. To enable him to execute these\norders, the Chief of Glennaquoich occupied the church-yard of Tranent, a commanding situation,\nand a convenient place, as Evan Dhu remarked, 'for any gentleman who might have the misfortune\nto be killed, and chanced to be curious about Christian burial.' To check or dislodge this\nparty, the English general detached two guns, escorted by a strong party of cavalry. They approached\nso near that Waverley could plainly recognise the standard of the troop he had formerly commanded,\nand hear the trumpets and kettle-drums sound the signal of advance which he had so often obeyed.\nHe could hear, too, the well-known word given in the English dialect by the equally well-distinguished\nvoice of the commanding officer, for whom he had once felt so much respect. It was at that\ninstant, that, looking around him, he saw the wild dress and appearance of his Highland associates,\nheard their whispers in an uncouth and unknown language, looked upon his own dress, so unlike\nthat which he had worn from his infancy, and wished to awake from what seemed at the moment\na dream, strange, horrible, and unnatural. 'Good God!' he muttered, 'am I then a traitor to\nmy country, a renegade to my standard, and a foe, as that poor dying wretch expressed himself,\nto my native England!'\n\nEre he could digest or smother the recollection, the tall military form of his late commander\ncame full in view, for the purpose of reconnoitring. 'I can hit him now,' said Callum, cautiously\nraising his fusee over the wall under which he lay couched, at scarce sixty yards' distance.\n\nEdward felt as if he was about to see a parricide committed in his presence; for the venerable\ngrey hair and striking countenance of the veteran recalled the almost paternal respect with\nwhich his officers universally regarded him. But ere he could say 'Hold!' an aged Highlander\nwho lay beside Callum Beg stopped his arm. 'Spare your shot,' said the seer, 'his hour is not\nyet come. But let him beware of to-morrow; I see his winding-sheet high upon his breast.'\n\nCallum, flint to other considerations, was penetrable to superstition. He turned pale at the\nwords of the _taishatr_, and recovered his piece. Colonel Gardiner, unconscious of the danger\nhe had escaped, turned his horse round and rode slowly back to the front of his regiment.\n\nBy this time the regular army had assumed a new line, with one flank inclined towards the sea\nand the other resting upon the village of Preston; and, as similar difficulties occurred in\nattacking their new position, Fergus and the rest of the detachment were recalled to their\nformer post. This alteration created the necessity of a corresponding change in General Cope's\narmy, which was again brought into a line parallel with that of the Highlanders. In these manoeuvres\non both sides the daylight was nearly consumed, and both armies prepared to rest upon their\narms for the night in the lines which they respectively occupied.\n\n'There will be nothing done to-night,' said Fergus to his friend Waverley; 'ere we wrap ourselves\nin our plaids, let us go see what the Baron is doing in the rear of the line.'\n\nWhen they approached his post, they found the good old careful officer, after having sent out\nhis night patrols and posted his sentinels, engaged in reading the Evening Service of the Episcopal\nChurch to the remainder of his troop. His voice was loud and sonorous, and though his spectacles\nupon his nose, and the appearance of Saunders Saunderson, in military array, performing the\nfunctions of clerk, had something ludicrous, yet the circumstances of danger in which they\nstood, the military costume of the audience, and the appearance of their horses saddled and\npicqueted behind them, gave an impressive and solemn effect to the office of devotion.\n\n'I have confessed to-day, ere you were awake,' whispered Fergus to Waverley; 'yet I am not\nso strict a Catholic as to refuse to join in this good man's prayers.'\n\nEdward assented, and they remained till the Baron had concluded the service.\n\nAs he shut the book, 'Now, lads,' said he, 'have at them in the morning with heavy hands and\nlight consciences.' He then kindly greeted Mac-Ivor and Waverley, who requested to know his\nopinion of their situation. Why, you know Tacitus saith, \"In rebus bellicis maxime dominalur\nFortuna,\" which is equiponderate with our vernacular adage, \"Luck can maist in the mellee.\"\nBut credit me, gentlemen, yon man is not a deacon o' his craft. He damps the spirits of the\npoor lads he commands by keeping them on the defensive, whilk of itself implies inferiority\nor fear. Now will they lie on their arms yonder as anxious and as ill at ease as a toad under\na harrow, while our men will be quite fresh and blithe for action in the morning. Well, good-night.\nOne thing troubles me, but if to-morrow goes well off, I will consult you about it, Glennaquoich.'\n\n'I could almost apply to Mr. Bradwardine the character which Henry gives of Fluellen,' said\nWaverley, as his friend and he walked towards their bivouac:\n\n    'Though it appears a little out of fashion,\n    There is much care and valour in this \"Scotchman.\"'\n\n'He has seen much service,' answered Fergus, 'and one is sometimes astonished to find how much\nnonsense and reason are mingled in his composition. I wonder what can be troubling his mind;\nprobably something about Rose. Hark! the English are setting their watch.'\n\nThe roll of the drum and shrill accompaniment of the fifes swelled up the hill--died away--resumed\nits thunder--and was at length hushed. The trumpets and kettle-drums of the cavalry were next\nheard to perform the beautiful and wild point of war appropriated as a signal for that piece\nof nocturnal duty, and then finally sunk upon the wind with a shrill and mournful cadence.\n\nThe friends, who had now reached their post, stood and looked round them ere they lay down\nto rest. The western sky twinkled with stars, but a frost-mist, rising from the ocean, covered\nthe eastern horizon, and rolled in white wreaths along the plain where the adverse army lay\ncouched upon their arms. Their advanced posts were pushed as far as the side of the great ditch\nat the bottom of the descent, and had kindled large fires at different intervals, gleaming\nwith obscure and hazy lustre through the heavy fog which encircled them with a doubtful halo.\n\nThe Highlanders,'thick as leaves in Vallombrosa,' lay stretched upon the ridge of the hill,\nburied (excepting their sentinels) in the most profound repose. 'How many of these brave fellows\nwill sleep more soundly before to-morrow night, Fergus!' said Waverley, with an involuntary sigh.\n\n'You must not think of that,' answered Fergus, whose ideas were entirely military. 'You must\nonly think of your sword, and by whom it was given. All other reflections are now TOO LATE.'\n\nWith the opiate contained in this undeniable remark Edward endeavoured to lull the tumult of\nhis conflicting feelings. The Chieftain and he, combining their plaids, made a comfortable\nand warm couch. Callum, sitting down at their head (for it was his duty to watch upon the immediate\nperson of the Chief), began a long mournful song in Gaelic, to a low and uniform tune, which,\nlike the sound of the wind at a distance, soon lulled them to sleep.\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE CONFLICT\n\nWhen Fergus Mac-Ivor and his friend had slept for a few hours, they were awakened and summoned\nto attend the Prince. The distant village clock was heard to toll three as they hastened to\nthe place where he lay. He was already surrounded by his principal officers and the chiefs\nof clans. A bundle of pease-straw, which had been lately his couch, now served for his seat.\nJust as Fergus reached the circle, the consultation had broken up. 'Courage, my brave friends!'\nsaid the Chevalier, 'and each one put himself instantly at the head of his command; a faithful\nfriend [Footnote: See Note 32.] has offered to guide us by a practicable, though narrow and\ncircuitous, route, which, sweeping to our right, traverses the broken ground and morass, and\nenables us to gain the firm and open plain upon which the enemy are lying. This difficulty\nsurmounted, Heaven and your good swords must do the rest.'\n\nThe proposal spread unanimous joy, and each leader hastened to get his men into order with\nas little noise as possible. The army, moving by its right from off the ground on which they\nhad rested, soon entered the path through the morass, conducting their march with astonishing\nsilence and great rapidity. The mist had not risen to the higher grounds, so that for some\ntime they had the advantage of star-light. But this was lost as the stars faded before approaching\nday, and the head of the marching column, continuing its descent, plunged as it were into the\nheavy ocean of fog, which rolled its white waves over the whole plain, and over the sea by\nwhich it was bounded. Some difficulties were now to be encountered, inseparable from darkness,\na narrow, broken, and marshy path, and the necessity of preserving union in the march. These,\nhowever, were less inconvenient to Highlanders, from their habits of life, than they would\nhave been to any other troops, and they continued a steady and swift movement.\n\nAs the clan of Ivor approached the firm ground, following the track of those who preceded them,\nthe challenge of a patrol was heard through the mist, though they could not see the dragoon\nby whom it was made--'Who goes there?'\n\n'Hush!' cried Fergus, 'hush! let none answer, as he values his life; press forward'; and they\ncontinued their march with silence and rapidity.\n\nThe patrol fired his carabine upon the body, and the report was instantly followed by the clang\nof his horse's feet as he galloped off. 'Hylax in limine latrat,' said the Baron of Bradwardine,\nwho heard the shot; 'that loon will give the alarm.'\n\nThe clan of Fergus had now gained the firm plain, which had lately borne a large crop of corn.\nBut the harvest was gathered in, and the expanse was unbroken by tree, bush, or interruption\nof any kind. The rest of the army were following fast, when they heard the drums of the enemy\nbeat the general. Surprise, however, had made no part of their plan, so they were not disconcerted\nby this intimation that the foe was upon his guard and prepared to receive them. It only hastened\ntheir dispositions for the combat, which were very simple.\n\nThe Highland army, which now occupied the eastern end of the wide plain, or stubble field,\nso often referred to, was drawn up in two lines, extending from the morass towards the sea.\nThe first was destined to charge the enemy, the second to act as a reserve. The few horse,\nwhom the Prince headed in person, remained between the two lines. The adventurer had intimated\na resolution to charge in person at the head of his first line; but his purpose was deprecated\nby all around him, and he was with difficulty induced to abandon it.\n\nBoth lines were now moving forward, the first prepared for instant combat. The clans of which\nit was composed formed each a sort of separate phalanx, narrow in front, and in depth ten,\ntwelve, or fifteen files, according to the strength of the following. The best-armed and best-born,\nfor the words were synonymous, were placed in front of each of these irregular subdivisions.\nThe others in the rear shouldered forward the front, and by their pressure added both physical\nimpulse and additional ardour and confidence to those who were first to encounter the danger.\n\n'Down with your plaid, Waverley,' cried Fergus, throwing off his own; 'we'll win silks for\nour tartans before the sun is above the sea.'\n\nThe clansmen on every side stript their plaids, prepared their arms, and there was an awful\npause of about three minutes, during which the men, pulling off their bonnets, raised their\nfaces to heaven and uttered a short prayer; then pulled their bonnets over their brows and\nbegan to move forward, at first slowly. Waverley felt his heart at that moment throb as it\nwould have burst from his bosom. It was not fear, it was not ardour: it was a compound of both,\na new and deeply energetic impulse that with its first emotion chilled and astounded, then\nfevered and maddened his mind. The sounds around him combined to exalt his enthusiasm; the\npipes played, and the clans rushed forward, each in its own dark column. As they advanced they\nmended their pace, and the muttering sounds of the men to each other began to swell into a\nwild cry.\n\nAt this moment the sun, which was now risen above the horizon, dispelled the mist. The vapours\nrose like a curtain, and showed the two armies in the act of closing. The line of the regulars\nwas formed directly fronting the attack of the Highlanders; it glittered with the appointments\nof a complete army, and was flanked by cavalry and artillery. But the sight impressed no terror\non the assailants.\n\n'Forward, sons of Ivor,' cried their Chief, 'or the Camerons will draw the first blood!' They\nrushed on with a tremendous yell.\n\nThe rest is well known. The horse, who were commanded to charge the advancing Highlanders in\nthe flank, received an irregular fire from their fusees as they ran on and, seized with a disgraceful\npanic, wavered, halted, disbanded, and galloped from the field. The artillery men, deserted\nby the cavalry, fled after discharging their pieces, and the Highlanders, who dropped their\nguns when fired and drew their broadswords, rushed with headlong fury against the infantry.\n\nIt was at this moment of confusion and terror that Waverley remarked an English officer, apparently\nof high rank, standing, alone and unsupported, by a fieldpiece, which, after the flight of\nthe men by whom it was wrought, he had himself levelled and discharged against the clan of\nMac-Ivor, the nearest group of Highlanders within his aim. Struck with his tall, martial figure,\nand eager to save him from inevitable destruction, Waverley outstripped for an instant even\nthe speediest of the warriors, and, reaching the spot first, called to him to surrender. The\nofficer replied by a thrust with his sword, which Waverley received in his target, and in turning\nit aside the Englishman's weapon broke. At the same time the battle-axe of Dugald Mahony was\nin the act of descending upon the officer's head. Waverley intercepted and prevented the blow,\nand the officer, perceiving further resistance unavailing, and struck with Edward's generous\nanxiety for his safety, resigned the fragment of his sword, and was committed by Waverley to\nDugald, with strict charge to use him well, and not to pillage his person, promising him, at\nthe same time, full indemnification for the spoil.\n\nOn Edward's right the battle for a few minutes raged fierce and thick. The English infantry,\ntrained in the wars in Flanders, stood their ground with great courage. But their extended\nfiles were pierced and broken in many places by the close masses of the clans; and in the personal\nstruggle which ensued the nature of the Highlanders' weapons, and their extraordinary fierceness\nand activity, gave them a decided superiority over those who had been accustomed to trust much\nto their array and discipline, and felt that the one was broken and the other useless."}

It\nis not wonderful that such a people should think themselves exalted far above all others. Moses,\nthe first of all instructors and legislators, desired to raise his people above the fate which\nhad ruined other nations, by communicating to them firmness and perseverance in their adherence\nto such institutions, as should keep them a distinct nation from all others. These institutions\nwere peculiarly appropriate to the time, to the situation, and the circumstances of the people\nfor whom they were prescribed. It was not his design that the Children of Israel, when freed\nfrom their misery, after wandering forty years in the wilderness, should mix themselves up\nwith the Heathens, and adopt their morals and principles. He desired that they should continue\na distinct and holy people, that strangers should be extirpated, and their country be possessed\nby Jews alone. Their bounds were marked out by God himself, and extended from Lebanon and the\nEuphrates to the sea; and he commanded them to keep his commandments in the land which he had\nbestowed upon them, so that he alone should be their Lord. Hereupon, as I have before observed,\nMoses delivered such laws as were adapted to their situation. But these wanderers of the desert\nadhered not to the law delivered to them. We find even during the life of Moses much obstinacy,\nand an unbridled inclination to Heathenism was manifested, by their making objects of idolatrous\nworship. After the death of Moses, the seventy-two interpreters collected his doctrines; but\nthey added to them some, withdrew others, and confused several, by which the pure Mosaic opinions\nmust have been obscured. And we read accordingly, in the tenth chapter of Judges, \"that the\nchildren of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord.\" They served Baal and Ashtaroth, the\ndeities of the Syrians and Moabites, and even the gods of the Philistines, whom God had commanded\nthey should not serve.[6] Their hearts became hardened in their apostacy. The siege of Jerusalem\nby Nebuchadnazar, and the captivity in Babylon, had the most corrupting influence on the purity\nof the Mosaic doctrines, and on the laws. The original writings discovered by Hilkiah, were\nretrenched, added to, and the order of the events displaced. From the long residence amongst,\nand a great intercourse with strange people, all the frightful prejudices, all the fanciful\ndreams of our rabbins, were introduced into the sacred books. We learn from the second book\nof Chronicles, chap. xxxvi. verse 17, \"that the king slew the young men with the sword in the\nhouse of the sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man or him that\nstooped for age. And all the vessels of gold, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and\nof the king and all the princes, these he brought all to Babylon; and they burnt the house\nof God, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire.\"\n\n    [6] The greater part of the kings, both of Israel and of Judah,\n        served strange gods. Under Josiah, as he cleared out the\n        Temple, the book of the laws of Moses was found by Hilkiah the\n        priest, and was delivered to the king, who was much struck\n        with the threatenings it contained.\n\nDuring the seventy years that this captivity lasted, only a few old men survived who had retained\nany recollection of the laws of Moses. Esdras collected, as far as was possible, the doctrines\nof Moses; but they were mingled with too many principles which were foreign to them, and some\nof them may be traced to Zoroaster. The existence of the three sects of the Pharisees, the\nSadducees, and Essenes, each of which give a different interpretation of the word of God, abundantly\nprove this. Hillel and Schamai, a little before the time of Vespasian, had a school. The Rabbi\nJonathan Sillai, a pupil of Hillel, exalts his master by saying, \"If every tree were a pen,\nand the whole ocean ink, I should not be able to describe the wisdom I have received from Hillel.\"\nWhat extravagant expressions! How well do they paint the fanaticism of sectarianism! It was\nnot, however, long, before this blind zeal drew down on the people a punishment from Heaven,\nby the destruction of Jerusalem under the Roman chief, Titus. Read the work of Flavius Josephus,\nand you will behold the noble firmness and perseverance of the Israelites on one side, and\non the other the melancholy truth, that raving enthusiasm and blind obstinacy precipitated\nthe ruin of the most flourishing people in the world. The last siege and capture of Jerusalem\nwill ever be memorable in the history of mankind. How violent was the exasperation between\nthe two sects of the believers! What firmness and obstinacy in each party, who preferred death\nand the destruction of the whole nation to yielding up the smallest particle of their different\nopinions! At that time, there fell, by famine and the sword, more than a million of the Jews.\nOne part of the people were left as food for the wild beasts of the field, whilst some were\nkept alive to grace the triumph of the victor; but that which above all moved the grief of\nthe Israelites, was the destruction of that temple which had been erected by their own monarchs\nat so great an expense. Its glory has been described by the author already named; I find the\ndescription among my papers, and send it to you. You will weep as a true Israelite, and compare\nour former greatness with the degraded state to which the blindness and errors of our Elders\nhave reduced us.\n\nUnder Hadrian, the Jews were once more excited to a contest.[7] Bar Cochef announced himself\nas the Messias, but in the sequel 580,000 of our nation were destroyed, and the name of Jerusalem\nwas changed for that of Elia. The emperor Julian, usually called the Apostate, in his ambition\nfor future fame, ordered the Temple of Solomon to be rebuilt. But the fathers of the Christian\nChurch, as well as the contemporary author Ammianus Marcellinus, assert that a fire, which\nburst forth from the ground, suspended the operation at its commencement.\n\n    [7] About fifty years after the destruction of Jerusalem, when the\n        great body of the Jews held the opinion that the time for the\n        appearance of their Messias had arrived, there arose this man,\n        who announced himself in that character, and called himself\n        Bar Cochef, or the \"Son of a Star.\" He was acknowledged by\n        numbers of his people, who became his followers, declared him\n        their king, and made war upon the Romans, many of whom were\n        destroyed, both in Greece and in Africa. His power continued\n        betwixt three and four years, when the very people who had\n        supported him proclaimed him an impostor, and gave him the\n        name Bar Cosifa, or the \"Son of a Lie.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nANATOMY OF SOCIETY.\n\n_By J.A. St. John, Esq._\n\nThe title of this work leads the reader to expect a regular and connected series of illustrations\nof the constitution or frame-work of society, in which its scheme might be traced through the\nvarious ramifications. On the contrary, we have two volumes of essays of no consecutive interest,\nbut well written, and in some cases abounding with turns of scholarly elegance. They seldom\nflag, or grow vapid, notwithstanding they are on subjects of common life and experience, upon\nwhich moralists have rung the changes of words for centuries past. Occasionally, however, there\nare some new positions and little conceits which have more of prettiness than truth to recommend\nthem. To call Cowper's line\n\n  God made the country, but man made the town!\n\n\"a piece of impious jargon\" is no proof of Mr. St. John's acumen or fair comprehension of the\npoet's meaning, but accords with his unproved assertion \"The mark of man's hand is as visible\nin the country as in the town to all those who make use of their eyes.\" Yet this sentiment\nis a fair specimen of the stern stuff of which Mr. St. John's creeds and opinions are made\nup.[8] Nevertheless, the volumes are entertaining, and in proof we have carved out a few laconic\nextracts:\n\n    [8] One of Mr. St. John's lines in the Essay on the Influence of\n        Great Cities (the worst in the volume,) is \"The very name of\n        London sounds sweetly to me.\" This is not a whit better than\n        the man who thought \"no garden like Covent Garden, and no\n        flower like a cauliflower.\" Captain Morris's \"sweet shady side\n        of Pall Mall,\" compared to these sentiments, is a piece of\n        delicious refinement.\n\n_Love of Pleasure_.--The cause why men visit each other and converse, abstracting all considerations\nof business, seems to be simply the love of pleasure. This is the passion truly universal;\nthis is the pivot upon which the world intellectual, as well as the world of sense, turns.\nPhilosophers and saints feel it in their speculations and devotions, and yield to it too, in\ntheir way, as completely as the Sybaritish gourmand, whose stomach is his Baal and Ashtaroth.\nNor is this at all surprising, in reality, for the gratification of this passion is _happiness_--a\ngem for which all the world search, and but few find.\n\n_Conversation_.--The persons who shine most in conversation are, perhaps, those who attack\nestablished opinions and usages; for there is a kind of splendid Quixotism in standing up,\neven in the advocating of absurdity, against the whole world.\n\n_Love_.--Do we imagine, when we open some new treatise on Love, that the author has discovered\na fresh vein, and mined more deeply than all former adventurers? Not at all: we know very well\nthat the little god has already usurped all beautiful epithets, all soft expressions, all bewitching\nsounds; and the utmost we expect from the skill of the writer is, that he has thrown all these\ntogether, so as to produce a new picture. Love is immortal, and does not grow wrinkled because\nwe and our expressions fade. His heart is still as joyous and his foot as light as when he\ntrod the green knolls of Paradise with Eve. He will be young when he sits upon the grave of\nthe thousandth generation of our posterity, listening to the beating of his own heart, or sporting\nwith his butterfly consort, as childishly as if he were no older than the daisy under his foot.\nHis empire is a theme of which the tongue never grows weary, or utters all that seems to come\nquivering and gasping to the lips for utterance. We think, more than we ever spoke, of love;\nand if we have a curiosity when we first touch some erotic volume, it is to see whether the\nauthor has embodied our unutterable feelings, or divulged what we have never dared.\n\n_Wit in Season_.--The jest of an ex-minister is as flavourless as a mummy; as unintelligible\nas its hieroglyphical epitaph. Three days after his fall, his wit, under the sponge of oblivion,\nhas grown as much a mystery as the name of him who built the pyramid, or the taste of Lot's wife.\n\n_Read my book_.--When Hobbes was at any time at a loss for arguments to defend his unsocial\nprinciples, _viv\u00e2 voce_, he always used to say--\"I have published my opinions; consult my works;\nand, if I am wrong, confute me publicly.\" To most persons this mode of confutation was by far\ntoo operose; but they might have confoundedly puzzled the philosopher in verbal disputation.\n\n_In \"Vino Veritas.\"_--Horace with commendation of kings--\n\n            --who never chose a friend\n  Till with full bowls they had unmasked his soul,\n  And seen the bottom of his deepest thoughts.\n\nBut much dependence cannot be placed upon what is wrung out of a man under the influence of\nwine, which does not so much unveil as it disarranges our ideas; and, therefore, whoever contemplates\nthe character from the combination of ideas produced by intoxication, views man in a false\nlight. Violent anger has nearly the same effect as wine.\n\n_Cupid_--was painted blind by the ancients, to signify that the affections prevent the sight,\nnot so much from perceiving outward as inward defects.\n\n_Character_.--Whoever would study the characters of those with whom he lives or converses,\nmust keep up the appearance of a kind of recklessness and frivolity, for the mind closes itself\nup like the hedgehog, at the least sensible touch of observation, and will not be afterwards\ndrawn out. Men have been known in the middle of a discovery of their character, to be stopped\nshort by a look, which brought them to themselves, and traced before them in an instant the\ndanger of their position and the methods of escape. A keen observer, indeed, may always adjust\nthe temperature of his discourse by the faces of his auditors, which are saddened or brightened,\nlike the face of the sea in April, as more or less of the sunshine of rhetoric breaks forth\nupon them.\n\n_Greatness_.--What renders it difficult for ordinary minds to discover a great man before he\nhas, like a tree, put forth his blossoms, is the manner, various and dissimilar, in which such\npersons evolve their powers. For as in nature the finest days are sometimes in the morning\noverclouded and dark, so the developement of genius follows no rule, but is hastened or retarded\nby position and circumstance. But to a keen eye there always appear, even in the first obscurity\nof extraordinary men, certain internal commotions and throes, denoting some _magna vis animi_\nat work within.\n\n_Physiognomy_.--When Atticus advised Cicero to keep strict watch over his face, in his first\ninterview with C\u00e6sar after the civil wars, he could not mean that he might thereby conceal\nhis _character_ from C\u00e6sar, who knew well enough what that was; but he meant, that by such\nprecaution he might conceal from the tyrant his actual hatred and disgust for his person. Yet\nfor the character and secret nature of a man, _fronti nulli fides_.\n\n_Writing_.--It was Addison, we believe, who observed of the schoolmen, that they had not genius\nenough to write a small book, and therefore took refuge in folios of the largest magnitude.\nWe are getting as fast as possible into the predicament of the schoolmen. No one knows when\nhe has written enough; but, like a player at chess, still goes on with the self-same ideas,\nmerely altering their position. This must arise from early habits and prejudices, from having\nbeen taught to regard with veneration vast collections of common-places, under the titles of\nthis or that man's _works_. Tacitus may be carried about in one's pocket, while it will very\nshortly require a wagon to remove Sir Walter Scott's labours from place to place. Voltaire's\n_facility_ was his greatest fault; better he had elaborated his periods, like Rousseau; who,\nnotwithstanding, wrote too much. The latter, however, of all modern writers, best knew the\nvalue of his own mind. His prime of life was passed in vicissitude and study. He did not set\nhimself about writing books for mankind, until he knew what they possessed and what they wanted.\nIt was his opinion that a writer who would do any good should stand upon the pinnacle of his\nage, and from thence look into the future.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE NATURALIST.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBIRDS CHANGING COLOUR.\n\n_In a letter to the Editor of the Literary Gazette_.\n\nSir--Observing in the _Literary Gazette_ of last week, a notice of Mr. Young's account of the\nchange of colour in the plumage of birds from fear, I have been induced to mention some circumstances\nwhich, among others, fell under my own observation, and from which I am led to conclude that\nsuch changes among the volatile tribes are not so rare as may be imagined, and are often produced\nby disease, as well as by other mental passions besides terror.\n\nWithout referring to the celebrated _Jacobite_ goldfinch of Miss Cicy Scott, which the good\nold maiden of Carubber's Close affirmed became of a deep sable hue on the day of Charles's\nmartyrdom--though doubtless the natural philosopher would have discovered in this some more\nefficient cause than respect for the royal sufferer!--I myself recollect a partial change in\nthe colour of a fine green parrot, belonging to Mr. Rutherford, of Ladfield. Like Miss Scott,\nthe laird of Ladfield was a stanch adherent of the house of Stuart, and to his dying day cherished\nthe hope of beholding their restoration to the throne of Britain.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Rutherford amused his declining years by teaching Charley to whistle \"The\nking shall hae his ain again,\" and to gibber \"Send the old rogue to Hanover;\" for which he\nwas always rewarded by a sugar-plum or a dole of wassail (Scotch short-bread). Those epicurean\nindulgences at length induced a state of obesity; and so depraved became the appetite of the\nbird, that, rejecting his natural food, he used to pluck out the feathers from those parts\nof the back within his reach, and bruise them with his bill, to obtain the oily substance contained\nin the quills.\n\nThe feathers which grew on the denuded parts were whitish, and never resumed their natural\nhue. I often saw Charley long after the death of his master, and he looked as if Nature, in\none of her sportive moods, had created him half parrot, half gosling--so strangely did his\nwhitish back and tail contrast with his scarlet poll and brilliant green neck.\n\nA still more remarkable change of colour in a lark, belonging to Dr. Thos. Scott, of Fanash,\noccurred under my own eye, and which, I have no doubt, was produced by grief at being separated\nfrom a mavis. Their cages had long hung side by side in the parlour, and often had they striven\nto out-rival each other in the loudness of their song, till their minstrelsy became so stunning,\nthat it was found necessary to remove the laverock to a drawing-room above stairs.\n\nThe poor bird gradually pined, moped, and ceased its song; its eyes grew dim, and its plumage\nassumed a dullish tint, which, in less than a fortnight, changed to a deep black.\n\nThe worthy physician watched with the eye of a naturalist this phenomenon; but, after awhile,\nfearing for the life of his favourite, he ordered it to be replaced alongside its companion.\n\nIn a short time it resumed its spirits and its song--recommenced its rivalry with the mavis;\nbut, after every moulting, the new feathers were always of the same coal-black colour. The\nmavis evinced no corresponding feeling of attachment--neither, so far as I recollect, missing\nits companion, nor rejoicing at its restoration.\n\nA.C.

So they wrote,\nand arranged for their passage, and, with Magdalen, spent the\nintermediate time in needful preparations at Belfast, and in an\nexpedition to the Causeway, where they laid in a stock of notes and\nobservations, all in a spirit that made Magdalen feel that she knew\nboth in a manner she had never done before, and loved them with a\ndeep value and confidence.\n\nWilfred meanwhile made very slow, if any, progress.\n\nThey took him to Belfast as soon as it was possible, and his mother\ncame to him.

{"ID": 1385, "text": "\nThen, again, great trials in life, great straits, dark and too-long-continued providences,\nprayer unanswered, or not yet answered in the way we dictate, bad men and bad causes growing\nlike a green bay tree, and good men and good work languishing and dying; these things, and\nmany more things such as these, of which this world of faith and patience is full, prove quite\ntoo much for some men till they give themselves up to a state of mind that is nothing better\nthan atheism.  \"My evidences and my certainty,\" says Halyburton, \"were not answerable to the\nweight I was compelled to lay upon them.\"  A figure which Goodwin in his own tender and graphic\nway takes up thus: \"Set pins in a wall and fix them in ever so loosely, yet, if you hang nothing\nupon them they will seem to stand firm; but hang a heavy weight upon them, or even give them\nthe least jog as you pass, and the whole thing will suddenly come down.  The wall is God's\nword, the slack pin is our faith, and the weight and the jog are the heavy burdens and the\nsudden shocks of life, and down our hearts go, wall and pin and suspended vessel and all.\"\n\nWhen the church and her ministers, when the Scriptures and their anomalies, and when the faults\nand failings of Christian men are made the subject of mockery and laughter, the reverence,\nthe fear, the awe, the respect that all enter so largely into religion, and especially into\nthe religion of young people, is too easily destroyed; and not seldom the first seeds of practical\nand sometimes of speculative atheism are thus sown.  The mischief that has been done by mockery\nand laughter to the souls, especially of the young and the inexperienced, only the great day\nwill fully disclose.\n\nAnd then, two men of great weight and authority with us, tell us what we who are ministers\nwould have found out without them: this, namely, that the greatest atheists are they who are\never handling holy things without feeling them.\n\n\"Is it true,\" said Christian to Hopeful, his fellow, \"is it true what this man hath said?\"\n\"Take heed,\" said Hopeful, \"remember what it hath cost us already for hearkening to such kind\nof fellows.  What!  No Mount Zion!  Did we not see from the Delectable Mountains the gate of\nthe City? And, besides, are we not to walk by faith?  Let us go on lest the man with the whip\novertakes us again.\"  Christian: \"My brother, I said that but to prove thee, and to fetch from\nthee a fruit of the honesty of thy heart.\"  Many a deep and powerful passage has Butler composed\non that thesis which Hopeful here supplies him with; and many a brilliant sermon has Newman\npreached on that same text till he has made our \"predispositions to faith\" a fruitful and an\never fresh commonplace to hundreds of preachers.  Yes; the best bulwark of faith is a good\nand honest heart.  To such a happy heart the truth is its own unshaken evidence.  To whom can\nwe go but to Thee?--they who have such a heart protest.  The whole bent of such men's minds\nis toward the truth of the gospel.  Their instincts keep them on the right way even when their\nreason and their observation are both confounded.  As Newman keeps on saying, they are \"easy\nof belief.\"  They cannot keep away from Christ and His church.  They cannot turn back.  They\nmust go on.  Though He slay them they will die yearning after Him.  They often fall into great\nerror and into great guilt, but their seed remaineth in them, and they cannot continue in error\nor in guilt, because they are born of God.  They are they in whom\n\n   \"Persuasion and belief\n   Have ripened into faith; and faith become\n   A passionate intuition.\"\n\nHOPEFUL\n\n   \"We are saved by hope.\"--_Paul_\n\nUp till the time when Christian and Faithful passed through Vanity Fair on their way to the\nCelestial City, Hopeful was one of the most light- minded men in all that light-minded town.\nBy his birth, and both on his father's and his mother's side, Hopeful was, to begin with, a\nyouth of an unusually shallow and silly mind.  In the jargon of our day he was a man of a peculiarly\noptimistic temperament.  No one ever blamed him for being too subjective and introspective.\nIt took many sharp trials and many bitter disappointments to take the inborn frivolity and\nsuperficiality out of this young man's heart.  He was far on in his life, he was far on even\nin his religious life, before you would have ever thought of calling him a serious-minded man.\nHopeful had been born and brought up to early manhood in the town of Vanity, and he knew nothing\nbetter and desired nothing better than to lay out his whole life and to rest all his hopes\non the things of the fair; on such things, that is, as houses, lands, places, honours, preferments,\ntitles, pleasures, and delights of all sorts.  And that vain and empty life went on with him,\ntill, as he told his companion afterwards, it had all ended with him in revelling, and drinking,\nand uncleanness, and Sabbath-breaking, and all such things as destroyed his soul.  But in Hopeful's\nhappy case also the blood of the martyrs became the seed of the church.  Hopeful, as he was\nafterwards called, had suffered so many bitter disappointments and shipwrecks of expectation\nfrom the things of the fair, that is to say, from the houses, the places, the preferments,\nthe pleasures and what not, of the fair, that even his heart was ripe for something better\nthan any of those things, when, as God would have it, Christian and Faithful came to the town.\nHopeful was still hanging about the booths of the fair; he was just fingering his last sixpence\nover a commodity that he knew quite well would be like gall in his belly as soon as he had\nbought it; when,--what is that hubbub that rolls down the street?  Hopeful was always the first\nto see and to hear every new thing that came to the town, and thus it was that he was soon\nin the thick of the tumult that rose around Christian and Faithful.  Had those two pilgrims\ncome to the town at any former time, Hopeful would have been among the foremost to mock at\nand smite the two men; but, to-day, Hopeful's heart is so empty, and his purse also, that he\nis already won to their side by the loving looks and the wise and sweet words of the two ill-used\nmen.  Some of the men of the town said that the two pilgrims were outlandish and bedlamite\nmen, but Hopeful took courage to reprove some of the foremost of the mob.  Till, at last, when\nFaithful was at the stake, it was all that his companions could do to keep back Hopeful from\nleaping up on the burning pile and embracing the expiring man.  And then, when He who overrules\nall things so brought it about that Christian escaped out of their hands, who should come forth\nand join him at the upward gate of the city but just Hopeful, who not only joined himself to\nthe lonely pilgrim, but told him also that there were many more of the men of the city who\nwould take their time and follow after.  And thus, adds his biographer, when one died to make\nhis testimony to the truth, another rose up out of his ashes to be a companion to Christian.\n\nWhen Madame Krudener was getting her foot measured by a pietist shoemaker, she was so struck\nwith the repose and the sweetness and the heavenly joy of the poor man's look and manner that\nshe could not help but ask him what had happened to him that he had such a look on his countenance\nand such a light in his eye.  She was miserable, though she had all that heart could wish.\nShe had all that made her one of the most envied women in Europe; she had birth, talents, riches,\nrank, and the friendship of princes and princesses, and yet she was of all women the most miserable.\nAnd here was a poor chance shoemaker whose whole heart was running over with a joy such that\nall her wealth could not purchase to her heart one single drop of it.  The simple soul soon\ntold her his secret; it was no secret: it was just Jesus Christ who had done it all. And thus\nher poor shoemaker's happy face was the means of this great lady's conversion.  And, in like\nmanner, it was the beholding of Christian and Faithful in their words and in their behaviour\nat the fair that decided Hopeful to join himself to Christian and henceforth to be his companion.\n\nWhat were the things, asked Christian of his young companion, that first led you to leave off\nthe vanities of the fair and to think to be a pilgrim?  Many things, replied Hopeful.  Sometimes\nif I did but meet a good man in the street.  Or if mine head began unaccountably, or mine heart,\nto ache.  Or if some one of my companions became suddenly sick.  Or if I heard the bell toll\nthat some one was dead.  But, especially, when I thought of myself that I must quickly come\nto judgment.  And then it is told in the best style of the book how peace and rest and the\nbeginning of true satisfaction came to poor Hopeful's heart at last.  But you must promise\nme to read the passage for yourselves before you sleep to-night; and to read it again and again\ntill, like Hopeful's, your heart also is full of joy, and your eyes full of tears, and your\naffections running over with love to the name and to the people and to all the ways of Jesus\nChrist.\n\nAnd then, it is very encouraging and reassuring to us to see how Hopeful's true conversion\nso deepened and sobered and strengthened his whole character.  He remained to the end in his\nmental constitution and whole temperament, as we say, the same man he had always been; but,\nwhile remaining the same man, at the same time a most wonderful change gradually began to come\nover him, till, by slow but sure degrees, he became the Hopeful we know and look to and lean\nupon.  To use his own autobiographic words about himself, it was \"by hearing and considering\nof things that are Divine\" that his natural levity was so completely whipped out of his soul\ntill he was made at last an indispensable companion to Christian, strong-minded and serious-minded\nman as he was.  \"Conversion to God,\" says William Law, \"is often very sudden and instantaneous,\nunexpectedly raised from variety of occasions.  Thus, one by seeing only a withered tree, another\nby reading the lives and deaths of the antediluvian fathers, one by hearing of heaven, another\nof hell, one by reading of the love or wrath of God, another of the sufferings of Christ, may\nfind himself, as it were, melted into penitence all of a sudden.  It may be granted also that\nthe greatest sinner may in a moment be converted to God, and may feel himself wounded in such\na degree as perhaps those never were who have been turning to God all their lives.  But, then,\nit is to be observed that this suddenness of change or flash of conviction is by no means of\nthe essence of true conversion.  This stroke of conversion is not to be considered as signifying\nour high state of a new birth in Christ, or a proof that we are on a sudden made new creatures,\nbut that we are thus suddenly called upon and stirred up to look after a newness of nature.\nThe renewal of our first birth and state is something entirely distinct from our first sudden\nconversion and call to repentance.  That is not a thing done in an instant, but is a certain\nprocess, a gradual release from our captivity and disorder, consisting of several stages and\ndegrees, both of life and death, which the soul must go through before it can have thoroughly\nput off the old man.  It is well worth observing that our Saviour's greatest trials were near\nthe end of His life.  This might sufficiently show us that our first awakenings have carried\nus but a little way; that we should not then begin to be self- assured of our own salvation,\nbut should remember that we stand at a great distance from, and are in great ignorance of,\nour severest trials.\" Such was the way that Christian in his experience and in his wisdom talked\nto his young companion till his outward trials and the consequent discoveries he made of his\nown weakness and corruption made even Hopeful himself a sober-minded and a thoughtful man.\n\"Where pain ends, gain ends too.\"\n\nThen, again, no one can read Hopeful's remarkable history without discovering this about him,\nthat he showed best in adversity and distress, just as he showed worst in deliverance and prosperity.\nIt is a fine lesson in Christian hope to descend into Giant Despair's dungeon and hear the\nolder pilgrim groaning and the younger pilgrim consoling him, and, again, to stand on the bank\nof the last river and hear Hopeful holding up Christian's drowning head.  \"Be of good cheer,\nmy brother, for I feel the bottom, and it is good!\"  Bless Hopeful for that, all you whose\ndeathbeds are still before you.  For never was more true and fit word spoken for a dying hour\nthan that.  Read, till you have it by heart and in the dark, Hopeful's whole history, but especially\nhis triumphant end.  And have some one bespoken beforehand to read Hopeful in the River to\nyou when you have in a great measure lost your senses, and when a great horror has taken hold\nof your mind.  \"I sink in deep waters,\" cried Christian, as his sins came to his mind, even\nthe sins which he had committed both since and before he came to be a pilgrim.  \"But I see\nthe gate,\" said Hopeful, \"and men standing at it ready to receive us.\"  \"Read to me where I\nfirst cast my anchor,\" said John Knox to his weeping wife.\n\nThe Enchanted Ground, on the other hand, threatened to throw Hopeful back again into his former\nlight-minded state.  And there is no saying what shipwreck he might have made there had the\nolder man not been with him to steady and reprove and instruct him.  As it was, a touch now\nand then of his old vain temper returned to him till it took all his companion's watchfulness\nand wariness to carry them both out of that second Vanity Fair.  \"I acknowledge myself in a\nfault,\" said Hopeful to Christian, \"and had I been here alone I had run in danger of death.\nHitherto, thy company hath been my mercy, and thou shalt have a good reward for all thy labour.\"\n\nNow, my brethren, in my opinion we owe a great debt of gratitude to John Bunyan for the large\nand the displayed place he has given to Hopeful in the _Pilgrim's Progress_.  The fulness and\nbalance and proportion of the _Pilgrim's Progress_ are features of that wonderful book far\ntoo much overlooked.  So far as my reading goes I do not know any other author who has at all\ndone the justice to the saving grace of hope that John Bunyan has done both in his doctrinal\nand in his allegorical works.  Bunyan stands alone and supreme not only for the insight, and\nthe power with which he has constructed the character and the career of Hopeful, but even for\nhaving given him the space at all adequate to his merits and his services.  In those eighty-seven\nso suggestive pages that form the index to Dr. Thomas Goodwin's works I find some hundred and\ntwenty-four references to \"faith,\" while there are only two references to \"hope.\"  And that\nsame oversight and neglect runs through all our religious literature, and I suppose, as a consequence,\nthrough all our preaching too.  Now that is not the treatment the Bible gives to this so essential\nChristian grace, as any one may see at a glance who takes the trouble to turn up his Cruden.\nHope has a great place alongside of faith and love in the Holy Scriptures, and it has a correspondingly\nlarge and eloquent place in Bunyan.  Now, that being so, why is it that this so great and so\nblessed grace has so fallen out of our sermons and out of our hearts?  May God grant that our\nreading of Hopeful's autobiography and his subsequent history to-night may do something to\nrestore the blessed grace of hope to its proper place both in our pulpit and in all our hearts.\n\nTo kindle then, to quicken, and to anchor your hope, my brethren, may I have God's help to\nspeak for a little longer to your hearts concerning this neglected grace!  For, what is hope?\nHope is a passion of the soul, wise or foolish, to be ashamed of or to be proud of, just according\nto the thing hoped for, and just according to the grounds of the hope.  Hope is made up of\nthese two ingredients--desire and expectation.  What we greatly desire we take no rest till\nwe find good grounds on which to build up our expectations of it; and when we have found good\ngrounds for our expectations, then a glad hope takes possession of our hearts.  Now, to begin\nwith, how is it with your desires?  You are afraid to say much about your expectations and\nyour hopes.  Well; let us come to your hearts' desires.--Men of God, I will enter into your\nhearts and I will tell you your hearts' desires better than you know them yourselves; for the\nheart is deceitful above all things.  The time was, when, like this young pilgrim before he\nbecame a pilgrim, your desires were all set on houses, and lands, and places, and honours,\nand preferments, and wives, and children, and silver, and gold, and what not.  These things\nat one time were the utmost limit of your desires.  But that has all been changed.  For now\nyou have begun to desire a better city, that is, an heavenly.  What is your chief desire for\nthis New Year? {2}   Is it not a new heart?  Is it not a clean heart?  Is it not a holy heart?\nIs it not that the Holy Ghost would write the golden rule on the tables of your heart?  Does\nnot God know that it is the deepest desire of your heart to be able to love your neighbour\nas yourself?  To be able to rejoice with him in his joy as well as to weep with him in his\nsorrow?  What would you not give never again to feel envy in your heart at your brother, or\nstraitness and pining at his prosperity?  One thing do I desire, said the Psalmist, that mine\near may be nailed to the doorpost of my God: that I may always be His servant, and may never\nwander from His service.  Now, that is your desire too.  I am sure it is.  You would not say\nit of yourself, but I defy you to deny it when it is said about you.  Well, then, such things\nbeing found among your desires, what grounds have you for expecting the fulfilment of such\ndesires?  What grounds?  The best of grounds and every ground.  For you have the sure ground\nof God's word. And you have more than His word: you have His very nature, and the very nature\nof things.  For shall God create such desires in any man's heart only to starve and torture\nthat man?  Impossible!  It were blasphemy to suspect it.  No.  Where God has made any man to\nbe so far a partaker of the Divine nature as to change all that man's deepest desires, and\nto turn them from vanity to wisdom, from earth to heaven, and from the creature to the Creator,\ndoubt not, wherever He has begun such a work, that He will hasten to finish it.  Yes; lift\nup your heavy hearts, all ye who desire such things, for God hath sent His Son to say to you,\nBlessed are ye that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for ye shall be filled.  Only, keep\ndesiring.  Desire every day with a stronger and a more inconsolable desire.  Desire, and ground\nyour desire on God's word, and then heave your hope like an anchor within the veil whither\nthe Forerunner is for you entered.  May I so hope? you say.  May I venture to hope?  Yes; not\nonly may you hope, but you must hope.  You are commanded to hope.  It is as much your bounden\nduty to hope always, and to hope for the greatest and best things, as it is to repent of your\nsins, to love God and your neighbour, to keep yourself pure, and to set a watch on the door\nof your lips.  You have been destroyed, I confess and lament it, for lack of knowledge about\nthe nature, the grounds, and the duty of hope. But make up now for past neglect.  Hope steadfastly,\nhope constantly, hope boldly; hope for the best things, the greatest things, the most divine\nand the most blessed things.  If you forget to-night all else you have heard to-day, I implore\nyou not any longer to forget and neglect this, that hope is your immediate, constant, imperative\nduty.  No sin, no depth of corruption in your heart, no assault on your heart from your conscience,\ncan justify you in ceasing to hope.  Even when trouble \"comes tumbling over the neck of all\nyour reformations\" as it came tumbling on Hopeful, let that only drive you the more deeply\ndown into the true grounds of hope; even against hope rejoice in hope.  Remember the Psalmist\nin the hundred-and-thirtieth Psalm,--down in the deeps, if ever a fallen sinner was.  Yet hear\nhim when you cannot see him saying: I hope in Thy word!  And--for it is worthy to stand beside\neven that splendid psalm,--I beseech you to read and lay to heart what Hopeful says about himself\nin his conversion despair.\n\nAnd then, as if to justify that hope, there always come with it such sanctifying influences\nand such sure results.  The hope that you are one day to awaken in the Divine likeness will\nmake you lie down on your bed every night in self-examination, repentance, prayer, and praise.\nThe hope that your eyes are one day to see Christ as He is will make you purify yourself as\nnothing else will.  The hope that you are to walk with Christ in white will make you keep your\ngarments clean; it will make you wash them many times every day in the blood of the Lamb. \nThe hope that you are to cast your crown at His feet will make you watch that no man takes\nyour crown from you.  The hope that you are to drink wine with Him in His Father's kingdom\nwill reconcile you meanwhile to water, lest with your wine you stumble any of His little ones.\nThe hope of hearing Him say, Well done!--how that will make you labour and endure and not faint!\nAnd the hope that you shall one day enter in through the gates into the city, and have a right\nto the tree of life,--how scrupulous that will make you to keep all His commandments!  And\nthis is one of His commandments, that you gird up the loins of your mind, and hope to the end\nfor the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.\n\nTEMPORARY\n\n   \"They are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and\n   have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation\n   fall away.\"--_Our Lord_.\n\n\"Well, then, did you not know about ten years ago one Temporary in your parts who was a forward\nman in religion?  Know him! replied the other. Yes.  For my house not being above three miles\nfrom his house he would ofttimes come to me, and that with many tears.  Truly I pitied the\nman, and was not altogether without hope of him; but one may see that it is not every one who\ncries Lord, Lord.  And now, since we are talking about him, let us a little inquire into the\nreason of the sudden backsliding of him and such others.  It may be very profitable, said Christian,\nbut do you begin.  Well, then, there are in my judgment several reasons for it.\" And then,\nwith the older man's entire approval, Hopeful sets forth several reasons, taken from his own\nobservation of backsliders, why so many men's religion is such a temporary thing; why so many\nrun well for a time, and then stand still, and then turn back.\n\n1.  The fear of man bringeth a snare, said Hopeful, moralising over his old acquaintance Temporary.\nAnd how true that observation is every evangelical minister knows to his deep disappointment.\nA young man comes to his minister at some time of distress in his life, or at some time of\nrevival of religion in the community, or at an ordinary communion season, and gives every sign\nthat he is early and fairly embarked on an honourable Christian life.  He takes his place in\nthe Church of Christ, and he puts out his hand to her work, till we begin to look forward with\nboastfulness to a life of great stability and great attainment for that man.  Our Lord, as\nwe see from so many of His parables, must have had many such cases among His first followers.\nOur Lord might be speaking prophetically, as well as out of His own experience, so well do\nHis regretful and lamenting words fit into so many of our own cases to-day. For, look at that\nyoung business man.  He has been born and brought up in the Church of Christ.  He has gladdened\nmore hearts than he knows by the noble promise of his early days.  Many admiring and loving\neyes have been turned on him as he took so hopefully the upward way.  But a sifting-time soon\ncomes.  A time of temptation comes.  A time comes when sides must be taken in some moral, religious,\necclesiastical controversy.  This young man is at that moment a candidate for a post that will\nbring distinction, wealth, and social influence to him who holds it.  And the candidate we\nare so much interested in is admittedly a man of such outstanding talents that he would at\nonce get the post were it not that the holder of that post must not have his name so much associated\nwith such and such a church, such and such political and religious opinions, and such and such\npublic men.  He is told that.  Indeed, he is not so dull as to need to be told that.  He has\nseen that all along.  And at first it is a dreadful wrench to him.  He feels how far he is\nfalling from his high ideals in life; and, at first, and for a long time, it is a dreadful\nhumiliation to him.  But, then, there are splendid compensations.  And, better than that, there\nare some good, and indeed compelling, reasons that begin to rise up in our minds when we need\nthem and begin to look for them, till what at first seemed so mean and so contemptible, and\nso ungrateful, and so dishonourable, as well as so spiritually perilous, comes to be faced\nand gone through with positively on a ground of high principle, and, indeed, of stern moral\nnecessity.  So deceitful is the human heart that you could not believe what compelling reasons\nsuch a mean-spirited man will face you with as to why he should leave all the ways he once\nso delighted in for a piece of bread, and for the smile of the open enemies of his church,\nand his faith, not to say his Saviour."}

And as the day of his death approached, he went with Forkernus\nunto his brother Brocadius, and commanded Forkernus on his obedience that he should, after\nhis decease, take on himself the government of the church over which he presided.  But he,\nrefusing and protesting that it accorded neither to reason nor to justice that he should in\nthe church of his father take on himself the guidance of souls, lest he should seem to hold\nin heritage the sanctuary of the Lord, his father and pastor bound him thereto by his iterated\ncommands.  Why need we many words?  Lumanus would not bless him until he had promised to undertake\nthis office.  And at length Lumanus, having departed from this light unto the mansion of eternal\nlight, Forkernus, as enjoined, took on himself the care of his church; and after he had presided\nover it only three days, he committed it unto a certain stranger, by birth a Briton, named\nCathladius.  Thus did the man of God fulfil the command of his father, and thus he took care\nthat he should not set the example of selling the rights of the church or the heritage of his\nparents.  But all the revenues of this church were by Lumanus transferred to Saint Patrick\nand his successors, and for ever after given unto the church of Ardmachia.\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\n_Of the Prophecy of St. Patrick on Coyrbre, and of the Unfruitfulness of a River._\n\nAnd Leogaire had two brothers, the elder of whom was named Coyrbre, like unto him in cruelty\nand unbelief, if, indeed, any one could in that country be found like him, who contemned and\ncondemned the law of the Most High; and the younger was named Conallus, who retained no more\nof his birth than does the fish of the sea or the rose of the thorn. But Patrick having gone\nto Coyrbre, who then abided in the place called Tailltion, that he might convert him unto the\nChristian faith, if in any wise from that stone could a son be raised up unto Abraham, yet\nhe, his heart being hardened against belief, intended the death of the preacher who would have\npreached life unto him, and even in the middle of the river he scourged the servants of Patrick;\nand the saint, knowing him to be obstinate in his error, and to be abandoned of God, thus prophesied\nunto him: \"Since thou hast refused to bear the yoke of Christ, whose service is freedom, no\none of thy posterity shall attain the throne of thy kingdom, but in perpetual servitude shall\nthey serve the seed of thy younger brother, Conallus."}

{"ID": 1560, "text": "Lastly, anger arises from daring: for no one\nis angry while seeking vengeance, unless he dare to avenge himself,\nas Avicenna observes in the sixth book of his _Physics._ Accordingly,\nit is evident that hope is the first of all the irascible passions.\n\nAnd if we wish to know the order of all the passions in the way of\ngeneration, love and hatred are first; desire and aversion, second;\nhope and despair, third; fear and daring, fourth; anger, fifth; sixth\nand last, joy and sadness, which follow from all the passions, as\nstated in _Ethic._ ii, 5: yet so that love precedes hatred; desire\nprecedes aversion; hope precedes despair; fear precedes daring; and\njoy precedes sadness, as may be gathered from what has been stated\nabove.\n\nReply Obj. 1: Because anger arises from the other passions, as an\neffect from the causes that precede it, it is from anger, as being\nmore manifest than the other passions, that the power takes its name.\n\nReply Obj. 2: It is not the arduousness but the good that is the\nreason for approach or desire. Consequently hope, which regards good\nmore directly, takes precedence: although at times daring or even\nanger regards something more arduous.\n\nReply Obj. 3: The movement of the appetite is essentially and\ndirectly towards the good as towards its proper object; its movement\nfrom evil results from this. For the movement of the appetitive part\nis in proportion, not to natural movement, but to the intention of\nnature, which intends the end before intending the removal of a\ncontrary, which removal is desired only for the sake of obtaining\nthe end.\n________________________\n\nFOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 25, Art. 4]\n\nWhether These Are the Four Principal Passions: Joy, Sadness, Hope and\nFear?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that joy, sadness, hope and fear are not\nthe four principal passions. For Augustine (De Civ.

The principal passions should therefore be taken, either\nin the order of intention; and thus joy and sadness, which are the\nfinal passions, will be the principal passions; or in the order of\nexecution or generation, and thus love will be the principal passion.\nTherefore joy and sadness, hope and fear should in no way be called\nthe four principal passions."}

In the distance,\na wide and splendid landscape. SABALLIDIN and soldiers on guard below the tent.  Enter RUAHMAH\nin hunter's dress, with a lyre slung from her shoulder._\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  Peace and good health to you, Saballidin.\n  Good morrow to you all.  How fares my lord?\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n  The curtains of his tent are folded still:\n  They have not moved since we returned, last night,\n  And told him what befell us in the city.\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  Told him!  Why did you make report to him.\n  And not to me?  Am I not captain here,\n  Intrusted by the King's command with care\n  Of Naaman's life, until he is restored?\n  'Tis mine to know the first of good or ill\n  In this adventure: mine to shield his heart\n  From every arrow of adversity.\n  What have you told him?  Speak!\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n        Lady, we feared\n  To bring our news to you.  For when the king\n  Of Israel had read our monarch's letter,\n  He rent his clothes, and cried, \"Am I a god,\n  To kill and make alive, that I should heal\n  A leper?  Ye have come with false pretence,\n  Damascus seeks a quarrel with me.  Go!\"\n  But when we told our lord, he closed his tent,\n  And there remains enfolded in his grief.\n  I trust he sleeps; 't were kind to let him sleep!\n  For now he doth forget his misery,\n  And all the burden of his hopeless woe\n  Is lifted from him by the gentle hand\n  Of slumber.  Oh, to those bereft of hope\n  Sleep is the only blessing left,--the last\n  Asylum of the weary, the one sign\n  Of pity from impenetrable heaven.\n  Waking is strife: sleep is the truce of God!\n  Ah, lady, wake him not.  The day will be\n  Full long for him to suffer, and for us\n  To turn our disappointed faces home\n  On the long road by which we must return.\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  Return!  Who gave you that command?  Not I!\n  The King made me the leader of this quest,\n  And bound you all to follow me, because\n  He knew I never would return without\n  The thing for which he sent us.  I'll go on\n  Day after day, unto the uttermost parts\n  Of earth, if need be, and beyond the gates\n  Of morning, till I find that which I seek,--\n  New life for Naaman.  Are ye ashamed\n  To have a woman lead you?  Then go back\n  And tell the King, \"This huntress went too far\n  For us to follow; she pursues the trail\n  Of hope alone, refusing to forsake\n  The quarry: we grew weary of the chase;\n  And so we left her and retraced our steps,\n  Like faithless hounds, to sleep beside the fire.\"\n  Did Naaman forsake his soldiers thus\n  When you went forth to hunt the Assyrian Bull?\n  Your manly courage is less durable\n  Than woman's love, it seems.  Go, if you will,--\n  Who bids me now farewell?\n\nSOLDIERS:\n        Not I, not I!\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n  Lady, lead on, we'll follow you for ever!\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  Why, now you speak like men!  Brought you no word\n  Out of Samaria, except that cry\n  Of impotence and fear from Israel's king?\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n  I do remember while he spoke with us\n  A rustic messenger came in, and cried\n  \"Elisha saith, let Naaman come to me\n  At Dothan, he shall surely know there is\n  A God in Israel.\"\n\nRUAHMAH:\n        What said the King?\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n  He only shouted \"Go!\" more wildly yet,\n  And rent his clothes again, as if he were\n  Half-maddened by a coward's fear, and thought\n  Only of how he might be rid of us.\n  What comfort could there be for him, what hope\n  For us, in the rude prophet's misty word?\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  It is the very word for which I prayed!\n  My trust was not in princes; for the crown,\n  The sceptre, and the purple robe are not\n  Significant of vital power.  The man\n  Who saves his brother-men is he who lives\n  His life with Nature, takes deep hold on truth,\n  And trusts in God.  A prophet's word is more\n  Than all the kings on earth can speak.  How far\n  Is Dothan?\n\nSOLDIER:\n        Lady, 'tis but three hours' ride\n  Along the valley northward.\n\nRUAHMAH:\n        Near! so near?\n  I had not thought to end my task so soon!\n  Prepare yourselves with speed to take the road.\n  I will awake my lord.\n\n[_Exeunt all but SABALLIDIN and RUAHMAH.

[_She turns back._]\n  I've been your servant in this doubtful quest,\n  Obedient, faithful, loyal to your will,--\n  What have I earned by this?\n\nRUAHMAH:\n        The gratitude\n  Of him we both desire to serve: your friend,--\n  My master and my lord.\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n        No more than this?\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  Yes, if you will, take all the thanks my hands\n  Can hold, my lips can speak.\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n        I would have more.\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  My friend, there's nothing more to give to you,\n  My service to my lord is absolute.\n  There's not a drop of blood within my veins\n  But quickens at the very thought of him;\n  And not a dream of mine but he doth stand\n  Within its heart and make it bright.  No man\n  To me is other than his friend or foe.\n  You are his friend, and I believe you true!\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n  I have been true to him,--now, I am true\n  To you.\n\nRUAHMAH:\n        And therefore doubly true to him!\n  O let us match our loyalties, and strive\n  Between us who shall win the higher crown!\n  Men boast them of a friendship stronger far\n  Than love of woman.  Prove it!  I'll not boast,\n  But I'll contend with you on equal terms\n  In this brave race: and if you win the prize\n  I'll hold you next to him: and if I win\n  He'll hold you next to me; and either way\n  We'll not be far apart.  Do you accept\n  My challenge?\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n        Yes!  For you enforce my heart\n  By honour to resign its great desire,\n  And love itself to offer sacrifice\n  Of all disloyal dreams on its own altar.\n  Yet love remains; therefore I pray you, think\n  How surely you must lose in our contention.\n  For I am known to Naaman: but you\n  He blindly takes for Tsarpi.  'Tis to her\n  He gives his gratitude: the praise you win\n  Endears her name.\n\nRUAHMAH:\n        Her name?  Why, what is that?\n  A name is but an empty shell, a mask\n  That does not change the features of the face\n  Beneath it.  Can a name rejoice, or weep,\n  Or hope?  Can it be moved by tenderness\n  To daily services of love, or feel the warmth\n  Of dear companionship?  How many things\n  We call by names that have no meaning: kings\n  That cannot rule; and gods that are not good;\n  And wives that do not love!  It matters not\n  What syllables he utters when he calls,\n  'Tis I who come,--'tis I who minister\n  Unto my lord, and mine the living heart\n  That feels the comfort of his confidence,\n  The thrill of gladness when he speaks to me,--\n  I do not hear the name!\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n        And yet, be sure\n  There's danger in this error,--and no gain!\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  I seek no gain; I only tread the path\n  Marked for me daily by the hand of love.\n  And if his blindness spared my lord one pang\n  Of sorrow in his black, forsaken hour,--\n  And if this error makes his burdened heart\n  More quiet, and his shadowed way less dark,\n  Whom do I rob?  Not her who chose to stay\n  At ease in Rimmon's House!  Surely not him!\n  Only myself?  And that enriches me.\n  Why trouble we the master?  Let it go,--\n  To-morrow he must know the truth,--and then\n  He shall dispose of me e'en as he will!\n\nSABALLIDIN:\n  To-morrow?\n\nRUAHMAH:\n        Yes, for I will tarry here,\n  While you conduct him to Elisha's house\n  To find the promised healing.  I forebode\n  A sudden danger from the craven king\n  Of Israel, or else a secret ambush\n  From those who hate us in Damascus.  Go,\n  But leave me twenty men: this mountain-pass\n  Protects the road behind you.  Make my lord\n  Obey the prophet's word, whatever he commands,\n  And come again in peace.

There's One who rules in righteousness\n  High over all.\n\nNAAMAN:\n        What knowest thou of Him?\n\nRUAHMAH:\n  Oh, I have heard,--the maid of Israel,--\n  Rememberest thou?  She often said her God\n  Was merciful and kind, and slow to wrath,\n  And plenteous in forgiveness, pitying us\n  Like as a father pitieth his children.\n\nNAAMAN:\n  If there were such a God, I'd worship Him\n  For ever!\n\nRUAHMAH:\n        Then make haste to hear the word\n  His prophet promises to speak to thee!\n  Obey it, my dear lord, and thou shalt lose\n  This curse that burdens thee.  This tiny spot\n  Of white that mars the beauty of thy brow\n  Shall melt like snow; thine eyes be filled with light.\n  Thou wilt not need my leading any more,--\n  Nor me,--for thou wilt see me, all unveiled,--\n  I tremble at the thought.\n\nNAAMAN:\n        Why, what is this?\n  Why shouldst thou tremble?

For those whom you protect are clad in armour,\nwhich is proof against the sharpest lance, and they can thus bid defiance\nto all the clumsy attacks of the merely honest and downright--for a time;\nbut in the end their punishment comes, not always in the manner that their\nfriends predict, but none the less inevitable in one manner or another. For\nthey all fashion a ridiculous monster out of affectations, strivings and\nfalsehoods, and label it \"Myself;\" and in the end the monster takes breath,\nand lives and crushes his despised maker, and immediately vanishes into\nspace.\n\nPermit me to proceed in my usual way, and to offer you an example or two.\nAnd I begin with HERMIONE MAYBLOOM. HERMIONE was one of a large family of\ndelightful daughters. Their father was the well-known Dr. MAYBLOOM, who was\nDean of Archester Cathedral. His massive and convincing volumes on _The\nFauna and Flora of the Mosaic Books in their Relation to Modern Botanical\nInvestigation_, must be within your recollection. It was followed, you\nremember, by _The Dean's Duty_, which, being published at a time when there\nwas, so to speak, a boom in religious novels, was ordered by many readers\nunder the impression that it was likely to upset their mature religious\nconvictions by its assaults on orthodoxy. Their disappointment when two\nstout tomes, dealing historically with the _status_ and duties of Deans,\nwere delivered to them, was the theme of cheerful comment amongst the\nlight-hearted members of the Dean's own family.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWas there ever in this world so delightful a family circle as that of the\nDeanery? The daughters were all pretty, but that was their smallest merit.\nThey were all clever, and well-read, without a tinge of the bluestocking,\nand most of them were musical to the tips of their slender fingers. How\nmerrily their laughter used to ring across the ancient close, and how\nplayfully and gently they used to rally the dear learned old Dean who had\nwatched over them and cared for them since Mrs. MAYBLOOM'S death, many\nyears before, with all the tender care of the most devoted mother. And of\nthis fair and smiling throng, \"my only rosary,\" as the Dean used to call\nthem, HERMIONE was, I think, the prettiest, as she was certainly the most\naccomplished. Every kind of gift had been showered upon her by Nature. When\nshe played her violin, accompanied by her elder sister on the piano, tears\ntrickled unbidden down the aquiline nose of the militant Bishop of\nArchester, the chapter stood hushed to a man, and the surrounding curates\nwere only prevented by a salutary fear of ruining their chances of\npreferment from laying themselves, their pittances, and their garnered\nstore of slippers at her pretty feet."}

This afternoon it took shape and form.\n\n''Sposing, Nobbles, my father has forgotten the house?  Why, one day he may drive right past\nit; and if I was out there to stop him, how lovely it would be!'\n\nBobby leapt to his feet.  The front door was open; down the drive he sped to the big iron gate\nwhich led out to the high-road.  And then the impulse seized him to go up the road himself\nand ask anyone coming along if they had seen his father drive by.\n\n'Just fink, Nobbles, we shall see him coming along in a grand carriage with lots of horses;\nand he'll stop, and the horses will stop, and the coachmens; and he'll open his arms, and me\nand you will run straight into them; and we'll go right away, galloping on the road to a beautiful\nbig house, and every room--_every_ one, Nobbles--me and you will have for our own, and we'll\nnever, never go back to the House again, never till I'm a very old man with a white beard,\nand have to lean very heavy on you, dear Nobbles; and then we'll come to make a visit, and\nwe'll come in the big front door, and sleep in the best spare room, and I'll say, \"This is\nwhere me and Nobbles lived when we was waiting for father.\"'\n\nTalking rather breathlessly in this fashion, Bobby trotted along the road, perfectly oblivious\nof the fact that he was not allowed to wander out on the high-road alone.  His little heart\nwas bent upon bringing his long waiting to an end.  There was no reason to his childish mind\nwhy his father should not appear any day.

{"ID": 1278, "text": " Towards midnight the wind shifted, and snow began\nto fall.  It fell as I never saw snow fall before.  And the wind never ceased, and the smoke\nwas more blinding than ever, and the night grew colder.\n\nThere were fully six inches of snow on the ground when the clouds broke just before dawn, and\nbefore the first rays of the sun greeted us the wind died away.  It was Monday, October 19th.\nWith the return of daylight we ate the rest of the pea meal, and resumed our march down the\nvalley.  The daylight proved that my eyes had been greatly affected by the smoke of our night's\nfire. Everything had a hazy appearance.  George complained of the same trouble.  Soon after\nwe started, George came upon a grouse track in the fresh snow, and followed it to a clump of\nbushes a short distance off.  He aimed his pistol with great care, but the bullet only knocked\na few feathers out of the bird, and it flew away, to George's keen chagrin and my bitter disappointment.\n\nThe flour bag we were to look for was on the opposite or south side of the river, and it was\nnecessary to cross.  Before noon we reached a place at which George said it would be as easy\nto ford the stream as at any other.  The icy water came almost up to our armpits, but we made\nthe other shore without mishap.  There we halted to build a fire and thaw ourselves out; for\nimmediately upon emerging from the river our clothing froze hard and stiff. While waiting we\nhad some hot tea, and as quickly as possible pushed on.  We must reach the flour bag that night.\n\nI found it hard to keep the pace George was setting, and began to lag wofully.  Several times\nhe had to wait for me to overtake him. We came upon a caribou trail in the snow, and followed\nit so long as it kept our direction.  To some extent the broken path aided our progress.  In\nthe afternoon we came upon another grouse track. George followed it to a clump of trees, where\nthe bird was discovered sitting on a limb.  This time his aim was accurate, and the bird fell\nat his feet.  Quickly he plucked the wings, cut them off and handed me one with the remark:\n\"They say raw partridge is good when a fellus' weak.\"  It was delicious.  I ate the wing, warm\nwith the bird's life blood, bones and all, and George ate the other wing.\n\nI soon found it utterly impossible to keep George's pace, and became so exhausted that I was\nforced to take short rests.  At length I told George he had better go ahead and look for the\nflour; that I should rest, follow his trail and overtake him later.  He went on, but just over\nthe bare knoll we were crossing I found him sitting in the snow waiting for me.\n\n\"I don't feel right to go ahead and leave you,\" he said.  \"Do you see that second knoll?\" \nHe pointed to one of a series of round barren knolls about half a mile down the river.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well, don't you remember it?  No?  Why, that's where we camped when we threw the flour away,\nand that's where we'll stop to- night.  We'd better eat a mouthful to help us on.\"\n\nHe had plucked the head and neck of the grouse, and now proceeded to cut them off near the\nbody.  To me he gave the neck, and ate the head himself--raw, of course.\n\nIt was just dusk when we reached the knoll George had designated. Straightway he went to a\nbush, ran his hand under it and pulled out--the bag we were looking for.  We opened it eagerly.\nAs has been said, we left about four pounds of flour in it.  Now there was a lump of green\nand black mould.  However, we rejoiced at finding it; for it was something and it might sustain\nour lives. It might send George to the lard, and keep Hubbard and me until help could arrive.\n\nOn this side of the Susan the country for some distance had been burned; but, while there were\nno standing trees, and the place was entirely unsheltered, fallen spruce trees covered the\nground in every direction, so we found no difficulty in getting together a good pile of dry\nwood for our night's fire, and we soon had a rousing big one going.  For supper we ate all\nof the grouse boiled with some of the flour mould stirred in.  It was a splendid supper.\n\nI had not sat long before the fire when I felt a strange sensation in my eyes.  It was as if\nthey had been filled with sharp splinters, and I found it impossible to open them.  I was afflicted\nwith smoke-blindness, which is almost identical in its effect to snow-blindness.  George filled\nmy pipe with dried tea leaves and just a bit of his precious tobacco; then lit it for me, as\nI could not see to do it myself.  After our smoke we lay down, and I slept heavily; it was\npractically the first sleep I had had in three days.  Some time in the night George awoke me\nto make me eat a little of a concoction of the mouldy flour and water, cooked thick and a trifle\nburned after the style of nekapooshet, an Indian dish of which George was very fond.  At the\nfirst signs of dawn he again roused me, saying:\n\n\"It's time to be up, Wallace.  We're goin' to have more snow to travel in.\"\n\nHe was right.  The clouds were hanging low and heavy, and the first scattering flakes were\nfalling of a storm that was to last for ten days.  I was able to open my eyes in the morning,\nbut everything still looked hazy.  We boiled some of the wretched mouldy flour for breakfast,\nand then divided what remained, George taking the larger share, as he had the most work to\ndo.  Looking critically at my share, he asked:\n\n\"How long can you keep alive on that?\"\n\n\"It will take me two days to reach Hubbard,\" I replied, \"and the two of us might live three\ndays more on it--on a pinch.\"\n\n\"Do you think you can live as long as that?\" said George, looking me hard in the eye.\n\n\"I'll try,\" I said.\n\n\"Then in five days I'll have help to you, if there's help to be had at Grand Lake.  Day after\nto-morrow I'll be at Grand Lake. Those fellus'll be strong and can reach camp in two days,\nso expect 'em.\"\n\nIt was time for us to separate.\n\n\"George,\" I asked, \"have you your Testament with you?\"\n\n\"It's the Book of Common Prayer,\" he said, drawing it from his pocket; \"but it's got the Psalms\nin it.\"\n\nHe handed me the tiny leather-covered book, but I could not see the print; the haze before\nmy eyes was too thick.  I returned the book to him, and asked him to read one of the Psalms.\nQuite at haphazard, I am sure, he turned to the ninety-first, and this is what he read:\n\n\"Whoso dwelleth under the defence of the Most High; shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.\n\"I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my stronghold: my God, in him will I trust.\n\"For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome pestilence. \"He\nshall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers: his faithfulness\nand truth shall be thy shield and buckler. \"Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night:\nnor for the arrow that flieth by day; \"For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for\nthe sickness that destroyeth in the noon-day. \"A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand\nat thy right hand: but it shall not come nigh thee. \"Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold:\nand see the reward of the ungodly. \"For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house\nof defence very high. \"There shall be no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come\nnigh thy dwelling. \"For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee In all thy\nways. \"They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone. \"Thou\nshalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy\nfeet. \"Because He hath set His love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him up,\nbecause he hath known my name. \"He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with\nhim in trouble; I will deliver him and bring him to bonour. \"With long life will I satisfy\nhim: and show him my salvation\"\n\nThe Psalm made a deep impression upon me.  \"For he shall give his angels charge over thee:\nto keep thee in all thy ways.\"  How strange it seems, in view of what happened to me, that\nGeorge should have read that sentence.\n\nWe arose to go on our separate ways, George twenty-five miles down the valley to Grand Lake,\nand I fifteen miles up the valley to Hubbard.  The snow was falling thick and fast.\n\n\"You'd better make a cape of your blanket,\" suggested George. \"Let me fix it for you.\"\n\nHe placed the blanket around my shoulders, and on either side of the cloth where it came together\nunder my chin made a small hole with his knife.  Through these holes he ran a piece of our\nold trolling line, and tied the ends.  Then he similarly arranged his own blanket.\n\nI held out my hand to him.\n\n\"Good-bye, George.  Take care of yourself.\"\n\nHe clasped my hand warmly.\n\n\"Good-bye, Wallace.  Expect help in five days.\"\n\nNear the top of a knoll I stopped and looked back.  With my afflicted eyes I could barely make\nout George ascending another knoll.  He also stopped and looked back.  I waved my hand to him,\nand he waved his hand to me and shouted something unintelligible. Then he disappeared in the\nsnow, and as be disappeared a silence came on the world, to remain unbroken for ten days.\n\nXVIII. WANDERING ALONE\n\nWith every hour the storm gathered new force, and over the barren knolls, along which my course\nfor some distance lay, the snow whirled furiously.  The track George and I had made on our\ndownward journey soon was obliterated.  Once in the forenoon, as I pushed blindly on against\nthe storm, I heard a snort, and, looking up, beheld, only a few yards away, a big caribou.\nHe was standing directly in my path.  For a second he regarded me, with his head thrown back\nin fear and wonder; and then, giving another snort, he dashed away into the maze of whirling snow.\n\nMy eyes troubled me greatly, and the pain at length grew so intense that I was forced to sit\ndown in the snow for perhaps half an hour with both eyes tightly closed.  I was keeping some\ndistance from the river, as the obstructions here were fewer than near the bank.  In the afternoon\nit occurred to me that I might have turned in my course, and I took my compass from its case,\nto satisfy myself that I was going in the right direction; but my sight was so impaired that\nI could not read the dial, nor be certain which way the needle pointed.  And I wondered vaguely\nwhether I was becoming totally blind.\n\nMy day's progress was not satisfactory.  I had hoped to reach the place where George and I\nhad forded the river, and cross to the north shore before bivouacking, but in the deepening\nsnow it was impossible.  With the first indications of night, I halted in a thick spruce grove\nnear the river and drew together a fairly good supply of dead wood.  On the under side of the\nbranches of the fir trees was generally to be found a thick growth of hairy moss, and with\na handful of this as tinder it did not take me long to get a good fire blazing.  Close to the\nfire I threw a pile of spruce boughs that I broke from low branches and the smaller trees.\nI melted snow in my cup for water, and in this put a few lumps of mould from the flour bag,\neating the mixture after it had cooked a while.  On the couch of boughs by the fire I spent\na fairly comfortable night, waking only at intervals to throw on more wood and shake the snow\nfrom my back.\n\nThe storm was still raging in the morning (Wednesday, October 21st).  With the first grey streaks\nof dawn, I boiled another cup of snow water and mould, and then, slinging the flour bag over\nmy shoulder, began my day's struggle.  The snow was now knee-deep. Soon I reached the fording\nplace.  The river was beginning to freeze over.  For two or three yards from shore the ice\nbore my weight; then I sank up to my waist in the cold current. Approaching the other shore,\nI broke the outer ice with my arms until it became thick enough to permit me to climb out upon it.\n\nThe ice that immediately formed on my clothing make walking impossible, and reluctantly I halted\nto build a fire and dry myself.  This took fully an hour and a half, to my extreme vexation.\nI realised now that my hope of reaching Hubbard that night was vain.  While I dried my clothing,\nI made a cup of tea. I had just enough left for two brewings, so after drinking the tea I preserved\nthe leaves for further use, wrapping them carefully in a bit of rag.  Once more on my way up\nthe valley, I found, to my consternation and almost despair, that my eyes would again compel\nme to stop, and for nearly an hour I sat with them closed.  That night, with the snow still\nfalling, though very lightly, I made my couch of boughs by a fairly comfortable fire, and rested\nwell.\n\nOn Thursday morning (October 22d) a light snow was failing, and the weather was very cold.\nThe cup of thin gruel that I made from the green lumps of mould nauseated me, and I had to\nbrew some tea to settle my stomach and stimulate me.  With my piece of blanket drawn over my\nhead to protect my ears from the biting wind, and with my hands wrapped in the folds, I continued\nmy struggle towards camp.  I had to force my way, blindly and desperately, through thick clumps\nof fir trees, and as the branches were hanging low under their weight of feathery snow, I continually\nreceived a deluge of snow in my face.\n\nMy stock of matches was small and time was precious, and I did not stop at noon to build a\nfire.  Even when night began to close in upon me I still plodded on, believing that I now must\nbe near Hubbard.  The snow was falling gently, and as there was a moon behind the clouds the\nnight was sufficiently light for me to make my way tediously through the trees, with the roar\nof the rapids to guide me.  It must have been near midnight when, utterly exhausted, I was\nforced to abandon the hope of finding Hubbard before morning.  Fearing that the mould would\nagain sicken me, I ate nothing when I halted; I simply collected a few dry sticks and huddled\nfor the remainder of the night by a miserable fire, dozing and awaking with a shudder from\nawful dreams.\n\nThe storm continued during the night, and with the morning of Friday (October 23d) broke upon\nthe world and me with renewed fury.  I prepared myself another dose of the mould, and forced\nit down.  I was nervously anxious to get on and find Hubbard.  I knew I must be near him now,\nalthough the snow had changed the whole face of the country and obliterated all the landmarks.\nSoon I crossed a brook, frozen and covered with snow, that I felt must be the one near our\ncamp.  Eagerly I looked about me for the tent. Because of the falling snow and the snow-bent\nbranches, I could scarcely see twenty yards in any direction.  From snow-covered rock to snow-covered\nrock I went, believing each in turn to be the tent, but always to meet disappointment.  Repeatedly\nI stopped to peer into the maze of snow for smoke.  But there was none.  Again and again I\nshouted.  But there was no answer.  The tent was really near me, but it kept its secret well.\n\nI travelled on and on.  I became desperate.  Over and over I repeated to myself, \"I must find\nHubbard before night comes--I must find him--I must--I must.\"  At length the first signs of\nnight warned me that I must collect my wood, that I might be as comfortable as possible through\nthe dreary hours of darkness.  As night came on the storm moderated.  The wind ceased.  An\nunwonted, solemn, awful stillness came upon the world.  It seemed to choke me.  I was filled\nwith an unutterable, a sickening dread. Hubbard's face as I had last seen it was constantly\nbefore me. Was he looking and waiting for me?  Why could I not find him?  I must find him in\nthe morning.  I must, I must.  Before going to sleep I made some more gruel and tea, drinking\nthem both as a duty.\n\nThe snow was falling gently on Saturday (October 24th), the wind had mercifully abated, and\nthe temperature was somewhat milder. After more gruel and the last cup of tea I was to have\nin my lonely wanderings, I renewed my search for Hubbard.  I decided that possibly I was below\nthe camp, and pushed on to the westward. Finally I became convinced I was in a part of the\ncountry I had never seen before.  I began to feel that possibly I was far above the camp; that\na rescuing party had found Hubbard, and that, as my tracks in the snow had been covered, they\nhad abandoned the hope of finding me and had returned.  They might even have passed me in the\nvalley below; it was quite possible.  But perhaps George's strength had failed him, and help\nnever would come to any of us.\n\nI turned about, and again started down the valley.  After a time I attempted to cross the ice\non the river, to try and discover some familiar landmark on the south shore.  In midstream,\nwhere the current had not permitted thick ice to form, I broke through.  The water was nearly\nup to my armpits.  Standing there with the icy current swirling about me, I said, \"What's the\nuse?\"  It seemed to me I had reached the limit of human endurance.  Instead of trying to struggle\non, how much pleasanter to permit myself to sink beneath the water and thus end it all!  It\nwould be such a relief to die.\n\nThen there came to me the remembrance that it was my duty to live as long as I could.  I must\ndo my best.  As long as I had any strength left, I must exert myself to live.  With a great\neffort I climbed out on the hard ice, and made my way back to the north shore.  Night was approaching.\nI staggered into the spruce growth, and there came upon the same brook I have previously mentioned\nas crossing.  Near its bank I made my night fire.  That fire was within two hundred yards of\nthe tent.  Perhaps it is just as well that I did not know it.\n\nThe snow, which had fallen rather mildly, all day, thickened with the coming of night.  All\nthe loose wood was now buried under the snow, and it was with difficulty that I gathered a\nscant supply for the night.  My wet rags were freezing hard and stiff.  I moved about, half-dazed.\nI broke only a few branches for my bed, and sat down.  Scarcely had I done so when a woman's\nvoice came to me, kindly and low and encouraging.\n\n\"Hadn't you better break a few more boughs?\" it said.  \"You will rest better then.\"\n\nThere was no mistaking the voice.  It was clear and distinct.  It was the voice of my wife,\nwho had been dead for more than three years.  I remember it did not impress me as being at\nall strange that my wife, who was dead, should be speaking to me up there in the Labrador wilderness.\nIt seemed to me perfectly natural that she should be looking after my comfort, even as she\nhad done in life.  I arose and broke the boughs.\n\nI am not a spiritist.  I have never taken any stock in the theory that the spirits of the dead\nare able to communicate with the living.  So far as I have thought about them at all, it has\nbeen my opinion that spiritists are either fools or frauds.  But I am endeavouring to give\na faithful account of my feelings and sensations at the time of which I am writing, and the\nincident of the voice cannot be ignored.  Perhaps it was all a delusion--an hallucination,\nif you will, due to the gradual breaking down of my body and mind.  As to that, the reader\ncan form his own conclusions.  Certain it is, that from this time on, when I needed help and\nencouragement the most, I felt a vague assurance that my wife was by my side; and I verily\nbelieve, that if it had not been for this,--hallucination, delusion, actuality, reality, or\nwhatever it may have been,--I should now be in a land where the truth about these things is\nprobably known for certain.\n\nAt times I even thought I saw my wife.  And often, often throughout those terrible days her\nvoice came to me, kindly and low and encouraging.  When I felt I really could plod no farther\nthrough the snow, her voice would tell me not to lose heart, but to do my best, and all would\nbe right in the end.  And when, wearied beyond measure at night, I would fall into a heavy\nsleep, and my fire would burn low, a hand on my shoulder would arouse me, and her voice would\ntell me to get up and throw on more wood.  Now and again I fancied I heard the voice of my\nmother, who died when I was a boy, also encouraging and reassuring me.  Indescribably comforting\nwere those voices, whatever their origin may have been. They soothed me, and brought balm for\nmy loneliness.  In the wilderness, and amid the falling snow, those that loved me were ministering\nunto me and keeping me from harm.  At least, so it seemed to me.  And now, as I think of those\ndear voices, and feel once more that loving touch on my shoulder, there comes back to me that\nverse from the Psalm George read at our parting--\"For He shall give His angels charge over\nthee, to keep thee in all thy ways.\"\n\nIt is all like a half-dream to me now."}

{"ID": 106, "text": "If a settler wonders why not every new comer builds a root house despite its usefulness and comfort, it is because of the difficulties in getting such things accomplished. Unless they have plenty of ready money to afford extra workmen, the high cost of labour and short working seasons often lead to the postponement of building such convenient buildings. A cellar, which can be excavated in just two days, may suffice until a root house is made necessary. Even the writer and their family were guilty of such procrastination, but they are now cutting logs to build a root house in the spring. Nonetheless, the writer recommends building a root house and digging a well as soon as possible. The springs are close to the surface, making it neither laborious nor expensive, and creeks often dry up during dry weather, making spring water the best source of drinking water. Despite its length and severity, the writer enjoys the Canadian winter as it is the healthiest season of the year and it exempts one from the torment of insect bites that are common during warmer months. The writer expresses gratitude for the warm shawls and merinos sent by their mother, and their little James looks very cute in his new frock and cloak. The writer also mentions a fine cat named Nora Crena, a parting gift from a friend, who has kept out mice, chipmunks, crickets, and even large black ants that can spoil preserves, cakes and anything nice. In the first year of their new log house, the constant creaking sound produced by an insect called sawyers can be disturbing until one gets accustomed to it. This insect, in its immature state, has a whitish body composed of eleven rings and a pair of short, hard pincers, and leave heaps of fine sawdust after working in pine trees all night. They form a feast for woodpeckers and together, they help promote the rapid decomposition of forest trees.The wisdom that governs the natural world is truly infinite! We often witness significant events brought about by seemingly small agents, yet they are all working to fulfill the will of the Most High. One great need in our distant settlement is public worship, which we hope to remedy through a subscription to build a small church and schoolhouse and pay for a minister's attendance. Despite the fact that the settlers are a mix of Catholics, dissenters, and Episcopalians, we have a considerable congregation who joyfully listen to the Word of God. Spring has been busy for us as we continue to build and make additions to our home. I enjoy raising my poultry and cultivating a flowery hedge with native shrubs from our woods and lake shores. My husband and child are well, and we appreciate the friendly society that has grown in our community. Although we miss our family in England, we love Canada and have found happiness in our log house.I have always been one to focus on the positive aspects of life, rather than the negative. In a country like Upper Canada, where hard work is necessary for all, it would be foolish to waste energy on complaints and bring sadness into our homes. We must make the best of the situation we have chosen, and learn to enjoy the blessings we possess.\n\nAlthough we faced many challenges when we first arrived, including unexpected expenses and delays, we have been fortunate in many ways. Our land has increased in value, and we hope to soon enjoy the comforts of a cleared farm. My husband is beginning to appreciate the country more, and I find myself growing increasingly attached to it.\n\nWhile the climate in Upper Canada has not lived up to all the hype, as the summers can be hot and dry, with early frosts and snow, I have still enjoyed unique experiences. The variability of the climate has been interesting, and I have witnessed the beauty of the aurora borealis and a stunning meteoric phenomenon. \n\nOne young boy even described a cluster of shooting stars as a logging chain, a simile that seemed fitting given the occupation of many in the area. I have also seen a captivating green light rising above the dark pines, leaving me wondering if it could be a phosphoric exhalation or connected to the aurora.\n\nDespite challenges and disappointments, I am learning to appreciate the simple beauty of life in Upper Canada, in a place that may look completely different in the future, but will always hold a special place in my heart.I must now bid adieu to my dear friends and family as I have many letters to prepare that can only be sent when there is free conveyance. The inland postage is quite high, and you must pay for all you receive and send to and from New York. On another note, this spring I have successfully made maple sugar with a finer color and grain than any I have seen before. I passed the sap through a thin and then a thicker flannel before boiling it down in an iron pot. Before the liquid boiled, I beat up the white of one egg and spread it over the surface of the liquid. I removed the scum carefully while boiling and let it continue at a fast boil. I used a cooking stove, and one of the most challenging stages was when the liquor began to assume a yellowish frothy appearance, and steam obscured the contents of the pot. The sugar may safely be poured off into a tin dish, pail, basin, or any other utensil. I tried two different methods after taking the sugar from the fire, and both resulted in pure, sparkling sugar that tasted exactly like sugar candy. Generally, maple sugar is hard and compact, showing little grain and weighing heavy in proportion to its bulk."}

Now when I came to the well I\nmarked not them by it, but plunged, and the depth of that well seemed to me the very depth\nof the earth itself, so went I ever downward; and when I was near the bottom of the well I\nhad forgotten life above, and lo! no sooner had I touched the bottom of the well when my head\nemerged from the surface: 'twas wondrous!  But for a sign that touched the bottom of the well,\nsee, O Noorna bin Noorka, the Jewel, the one of myriads that glitter at the bottom, and I plucked\nit for a gift to thee.'\n\nSo Noorna took the Jewel from his hand that was torn and crimson, and she cried, 'Thou fair\nyouth, thou bleedest with the plucking of it, and it was written, no hand shall pluck a jewel\nat the bottom of that well without letting of blood.  Even so it is!  Worthy art thou, and\nI was not mistaken in thee.'\n\nAt her words Shibli Bagarag burst forth into praises of her, and he sang:\n\n              'What is my worthiness\n               Match'd with thy worth?\n               Darkness and earthiness,\n               Dust and dearth!\n\nO Noorna, thou art wise above women: great and glorious over them.'\n\nIn this fashion the youth lauded her that was his betrothed, but she exclaimed, 'Hush! or the\njealousy of this Ass will be aroused, and of a surety he'll spill us.'\n\nThen he laughed and she laughed till the tail of Karaz trembled.\n\nTHE HORSE GARRAVEEN\n\nNow, they descended leisurely the slopes of the mountain, and when they were again in the green\nof its base, Noorna called to the Ass, 'Ho! Karaz! Sniff now the breezes, for the end of our\njourney by night is the meadows of Melistan.  Forward in thy might, and bray not when we are\nin them, for thy comfort's sake!'\n\nThe Ass sniffed, turning to the four quarters, and chose a certain direction, and bore them\nswiftly over hills and streans eddying in silver; over huge mounds of sand, where the tents\nof Bedouins stood in white clusters; over lakes smooth as the cheeks of sleeping loveliness;\nby walls of cities, mosques, and palaces; under towers that rose as an armed man with the steel\non his brows and the frown of battle; by the shores of the pale foaming sea it bore them, going\nat a pace that the Arab on his steed outstrippeth not.  So when the sun was red and the dews\nwere blushing with new light, they struggled from a wilderness of barren broken ground, and\nsaw beneath them, in the warm beams, green, peaceful, deep, the meadows of Melistan.  They\nwere meadows dancing with flowers, as it had been fresh damsels of the mountain, fair with\nvariety of colours that were so many gleams of changing light as the breezes of the morn swept\nover them; lavish of hues, of sweetness, of pleasantness, fir for the souls of the blest.\n\nThen, after they had gazed awhile, Noorna bin Noorka said, 'In these meadows the Horse Garraveen\nroameth at will.  Heroes of bliss bestride him on great days.  He is black to look on; speed\nquivers in his flanks like the lightning; his nostrils are wide with flame; there is that in\nhis eye which is settled fire, and that in his hoofs which is ready thunder; when he paws the\nearth kingdoms quake: no animal liveth with blood like the Horse Garraveen.  He is under a\ncurse, for that he bore on his back one who defied the Prophet.  Now, to make him come to thee\nthou must blow the call of battle, and to catch him thou must contrive to strike him on the\nfetlock as he runs with this musk-ball which I give thee; and to tame him thou must trace between\nhis eyes a figure or the crescent with thy forenail.  When that is done, bring him to me here,\nwhere I await thee, and I will advise thee further.'\n\nSo she said, 'Go!' and Shibli Bagarag showed her the breadth of his shoulders, and stepped\nbriskly toward the meadows, and was soon brushing among the flowers and soft mosses of the\nmeadows, lifting his nostrils to the joyful smells, looking about him with the broad eye of\none that hungereth for a coming thing.  The birds went up above him, and the trees shook and\nsparkled, and the waters of brooks and broad rivers flashed like waving mirrors waved by the\nslave-girls in sport when the beauties of the harem riot and dip their gleaming shoulders in\nthe bath.  He wandered on, lost in the gladness that lived, till the loud neigh of a steed\nstartled him, and by the banks of a river before him he beheld the Horse Garraveen stooping\nto drink of the river; glorious was the look of the creature,--silver-hoofed, fashioned in\nthe curves of beauty and swiftness.  So Shibli Bagarag put up his two hands and blew the call\nof battle, and the Horse Garraveen arched his neck at the call, and swung upon his haunches,\nand sought the call, answering it, and tossing his mane as he advanced swiftly.  Then, as he\nneared, Shibli Bagarag held the musk-ball in his fingers, and aimed at the fetlock of the Horse\nGarraveen, and flung it, and struck him so that he stumbled and fell.  He snorted fiercely\nas he bent to the grass, but Shibli Bagarag ran to him, and grasped strongly the tuft of hair\nhanging forward between his ears, and traced between his fine eyes a figure of the crescent\nwith his forenail, and the Horse ceased plunging, and was gentle as a colt by its mother's\nside, and suffered Shibli Bagarag to bestride him, and spurn him with his heel to speed, and\nbore him fleetly across the fair length of the golden meadows to where Noorna bin Noorka sat\nawaiting him.  She uttered a cry of welcome, saying, 'This is achieved with diligence and skill,\nO my betrothed! and on thy right wrist I mark strength like a sleeping leopard, and the children\nof Aklis will not resist thee.'\n\nSo she bade him alight from the Horse, but he said, 'Nay.' And she called to him again to alight,\nbut he cried, 'I will not alight from him!  By Allah! such a bounding wave of bliss have I\nnever yet had beneath me, and I will give him rein once again; as the poet says:\n\n              \"Divinely rings the rushing air\n               When I am on my mettled mare:\n               When fast along the plains we fly,\n               A creature of the heavens am I\"'\n\nThen she levelled her brows at him, and said gravely, 'This is the temptation thou art falling\ninto, as have thousands before thy time. Give him the rein a second time, and he will bear\nthee to the red pit, and halt upon the brink, and pitch thee into it among bleeding masses\nand skeletons of thy kind, where they lie who were men like to thee, and were borne away by\nthe Horse Garraveen.'\n\nHe gave no heed to her words, taunting her, and making the animal prance up and prove its spirit.\n\nAnd she cried reproachfully, 'O fool! is it thus our great aim will be defeated by thy silly\nconceit?  Lo, now, the greatness and the happiness thou art losing for this idle vanity is\nto be as a dunghill cock matched with an ostrich; and think not to escape the calamities thou\nbringest on thyself, for as is said,\n\n               No runner can outstrip his fate;\n\nand it will overtake thee, though thou part like an arrow from the bow.'\n\nHe still made a jest of her remonstrance, trying the temper of the animal, and rejoicing in\nits dark flushes of ireful vigour.\n\nAnd she cried out furiously, 'How! art thou past counsel? then will we match strength with\nstrength ere 'tis too late, though it weaken both.'\n\nUpon that, she turned quickly to the Ass and stroked it from one extremity to the other, crying,\n'Karaz! Karaz!' shouting, 'Come forth in thy power!'  And the Ass vanished, and the Genie stood\nin his place, tall, dark, terrible as a pillar of storm to travellers ranging the desert. \nHe exclaimed, 'What is it, O woman?  Charge me with thy command!'\n\nAnd she said, 'Wrestle with him thou seest on the Horse Garraveen, and fling him from his seat.'\n\nThen he yelled a glad yell, and stooped to Shibli Bagarag on the horse and enveloped him, and\nseized him, and plucked him from the Horse, and whirled him round, and flung him off.  The\nyouth went circling in the air, high in it, and descended, circling, at a distance in the deep\nmeadow-waters.  When he crept up the banks he saw the Genie astride the Horse Garraveen, with\na black flame round his head; and the Genie urged him to speed and put him to the gallop, and\nwas soon lost to sight, as he had been a thunderbeam passing over a still lake at midnight.\nAnd Shibli Bagarag was smitten with the wrong and the folly of his act, and sought to hide\nhis sight from Noorna; but she called to him, 'Look up, O youth! and face the calamity.  Lo,\nwe have now lost the service of Karaz! for though I utter ten spells and one spell in a breath,\nthe Horse Garraveen will ere that have stretched beyond the circle of my magic, and the Genie\nwill be free to do his ill deeds and plot against us.  Sad is it! but profit thou by a knowledge\nof thy weakness.'\n\nThen said she, 'See, I have not failed to possess myself of the three hairs of Garraveen, and\nthere is that to rejoice in.'\n\nShe displayed them, and they were sapphire hairs, and had a flickering light; and they seemed\nto live, wriggling their lengths, and were as snakes with sapphire skins.  Then she said, 'Thy\nright wrist, O my betrothed!'\n\nHe gave her his right wrist, and she tied round it the three hairs of Garraveen, exclaiming,\n'Thus do skilful carpenters make stronger what has broken and indicated disaster.  Surely,\nI confide in thy star?  I have faith in my foresight?'\n\nAnd she cried, 'Eyes of mine, what sayest thou to me?  Lo, we must part awhile: it is written.'\n\nSaid he, 'Leave me not, my betrothed: what am I without thy counsel?  And go not from me, or\nthis adventure will come to miserable issue.'\n\nSo she said, 'Thou beginnest to feel my worth?'\n\nHe answered, 'O Noorna! was woman like thee before in this world?  Surely 'tis a mask I mark\nthee under; yet art thou perforce of sheer wisdom and sweet manners lovely in my sight; and\nI have a thirst to hear thee and look on thee.'\n\nWhile he spake, a beam of struggling splendour burst from her, and she said, 'O thou dear youth,\nyes!  I must even go.  But I go glad of heart, knowing thee prepared to love me.  I must go\nto counteract the machinations of Karaz, for he's at once busy, vindictive, and cunning, and\nthere's no time for us to lose; so farewell, my betrothed, and make thy wits keen to know me\nwhen we next meet.'\n\nSo he said, 'And I--whither go I?'\n\nShe answered, 'To the City of Oolb straightway.'\n\nThen he, 'But I know not its bearing from this spot: how reach it?'\n\nShe answered, 'What! thou with the phial of Paravid in thy vest, that endoweth, a single drop\nof it, the flowers, the herbage, the very stones and desert sands, with a tongue to articulate\nintelligible talk?'\n\nSaid he, 'Is it so?'\n\nShe answered, 'Even so.'\n\nEre Slubli Bagarag could question her further she embraced him, and blew upon his eyes, and\nhe was blinded by her breath, and saw not her departure, groping for a seat on the rocks, and\nthinking her still by him.  Sight returned not to him till long after weariness had brought\nthe balm of sleep upon his eyelids.\n\nTHE TALKING HAWK\n\nNow, when he awoke he found himself alone in that place, the moon shining over the low meadows\nand flower-cups fair with night-dew.  Odours of night-flowers were abroad, filling the cool\nair with deliciousness, and he heard in the gardens below songs of the bulbul: it was like\na dream to his soul, and he lay somewhile contemplating the rich loveliness of the scene, that\nshowed no moving thing.  Then rose he and bethought him of the words of Noorna, and of the\nCity of Oolb, and the phial of the waters of Paravid in his vest; and he drew it forth, and\ndropped a drop of it on the rock where he had reclined.  A deep harmony seemed suddenly to\nawake inside the rock, and to his interrogation as to the direction of Oolb, he heard, 'The\npath of the shadows of the moon.'\n\nThereupon he advanced to a prominent part of the rocks above the meadows, and beheld the shadows\nof the moon thrown forward into dimness across a waste of sand.  And he stepped downward to\nthe level of sand, and went the way of the shadows till it was dawn.  Then dropped he a drop\nof the waters of the phial on a spike of lavender, and there was a voice said to him in reply\nto what he questioned, 'The path of the shadows of the sun.'\n\nThe shadows of the sun were thrown forward across the same waste of sand, and he turned and\npursued his way, resting at noon beneath a date-tree, and refreshing himself at a clear spring\nbeside it.  Surely he was joyful as he went, and elated with high prospects, singing:\n\n          Sun and moon with their bright fingers\n            Point the hero's path;\n\n          If in his great work he lingers,\n            Well may they be wroth.\n\nNow, the extent of the duration of his travel was four days and an equal number of nights;\nand it was on the fifth morn that he entered the gates of a city by the sea, even at that hour\nwhen the inhabitants were rising from sleep: fair was the sea beyond it, and the harbour was\ncrowded with vessels, ships stored with merchandise--silks, dates, diamonds, Damascus steel,\nhuge bales piled on the decks for the land of Roum and other lands.  Shibli Bagarag thought,\n'There's scarce a doubt but that one of those sails will set for Oolb shortly.  Wullahy! if\nI knew which, I'd board her and win a berth in her.'  Presently he thought, 'I'll go to the\npublic fountain and question it with the speech-winning waters.' Thereupon he passed down the\nstreets of the city and came to an open space, where stood the fountain, and sprinkled it with\nParavid; and the fountain spake, saying, 'Where men are, question not dumb things.'\n\nCried he, 'Faileth Paravid in its power?  Have I done aught to baffle myself?'\n\nThen he thought, ''Twere nevertheless well to do as the fountain directeth, and question men\nwhile I see them.'  And he walked about among the people, and came to the quays of the harbour\nwhere the ships lay close in, many of them an easy leap from shore, and considered whom to\naddress.  So, as he loitered about the quays, meditating on the means at the disposal of the\nAll-Wise, and marking the vessels wistfully, behold, there advanced to him one at a quick pace,\nin the garb of a sailor.  He observed Shibli Bagarag attentively a moment, and exclaimed as\nit were in the plenitude of respect and with the manner of one that is abashed, 'Surely, thou\nart Shibli Bagarag, the nephew of the barber, him we watch for.'\n\nSo Shibli Bagarag marvelled at this recognition, and answered, 'Am I then already famous to\nthat extent?'\n\nAnd he that accosted him said, ''Tis certain the trumpet was blown before thy steps, and there\nis not a man in this city but knoweth of thy destination to the City of Oolb, and that thou\nart upon the track of great things, one chosen to bring about imminent changes.'\n\nThen said Shibli Bagarag, 'For this I praise Noorna bin Noorka, daughter of Feshnavat, Vizier\nof the King that ruleth in the city of Shagpat!  She saw me, that I was marked for greatness.\nWullahy, the eagle knoweth me from afar, and proclaimeth me; the antelope of the hills scenteth\nthe coming of one not as other men, and telleth his tidings; the wind of the desert shapeth\nits gust to a meaning, so that the stranger may wot Shibli Bagarag is at hand!'\n\nHe puffed his chest, and straightened his legs like the cock, and was as a man upon whom the\nSultan has bestowed a dress of honour, even as the plumed peacock.  Then the other said:\n\n'Know that I am captain of yonder vessel, that stands farthest out from the harbour with her\nsails slackened; and she is laden with figs and fruits which I exchange for silks, spices,\nand other merchandise, with the people of Oolb.  Now, what says the poet?--\n\n              \"Delay in thine undertaking\n               Is disaster of thy own making\";\n\nand he says also:\n\n          \"Greatness is solely for them that succeed;\n          'Tis a rotten applause that gives earlier meed.\"\n\nTherefore it is advisable for thee to follow me on board without loss of time, and we will\nsail this very night for the City of Oolb.'\n\nNow, Shibli Bagarag was ruled by the words of the captain albeit he desired to stay awhile\nand receive the homage of the people of that city. So he followed him into a boat that was\nby, and the twain were rowed by sailors to the ship.  Then, when they were aboard the captain\nset sail, and they were soon in the hollows of deep waters.  There was a berth in the ship\nset apart for Shibli Bagarag, and one for the captain.  Shibli Bagarag, when he entered his\nberth, beheld at the head of his couch a hawk; its eyes red as rubies, its beak sharp as the\ncurve of a scimitar. So he called out to the captain, and the captain came to him; but when\nhe saw the hawk, he plucked his turban from his head, and dashed it at the hawk, and afterward\nran to it, trying to catch it; and the hawk flitted from corner to corner of the berth, he\nafter it with open arms.  Then he took a sword, but the hawk flew past him, and fixed on the\nback part of his head, tearing up his hair by the talons, and pecking over his forehead at\nhis eyes.  And Shibli Bagarag heard the hawk scream the name 'Karaz,' and he looked closely\nat the Captain of the vessel, and knew him for the Genie Karaz.  Then trembled he with exceeding\nterror, cursing his credulities, for he saw himself in the hands of the Genie, and nothing\nbut this hawk friendly to him on the fearful waters.  When the hawk had torn up a certain hair,\nthe Genie stiffened, and glowed like copper in the furnace, the whole length of him; and he\ndescended heavily through the bottom of the ship, and sank into the waters beneath, which hissed\nand smoked as at a bar of heated iron.  Then Shibli Bagarag gave thanks to the Prophet, and\npraised the hawk, but the hawk darted out of the cabin, and he followed it on deck, and, lo!\nthe vessel was in flames, and the hawk in a circle of the flames; and the flames soared with\nit, and left it no outlet."}

Balzac, on the other\nhand, loved the world. How, with the acute powers of observation, and\nthe intuition, amounting almost to second sight, with which he was\ngifted, could he help doing so? The man who could at will quit his own\npersonality, and invest himself with that of another; who would follow\na workman and his wife on their way home at night from a music-hall,\nand listen to their discussions on domestic matters till he imbibed\ntheir life, felt their ragged clothing on his back, and their desires\nand wants in his soul,--how could he find life dull, or the most\ncommonplace individual uninteresting?\n\nIn dress Balzac was habitually careless. He would rush to the\nprinter's office, after twelve hours of hard work, with his hat drawn\nover his eyes, his hands thrust into shabby gloves, and his feet in\nshoes with high sides, worn over loose trousers, which were pleated at\nthe waist and held down with straps. Even in society he took no\ntrouble about his appearance, and Lamartine describes him as looking,\nin the salon of Madame de Girardin, like a schoolboy who has outgrown\nhis clothes. Only for a short time, which he describes with glee in\nhis letters to Madame Hanska, did he pose as a man of fashion. Then he\nwore a magnificent white waistcoat, and a blue coat with gold buttons;\ncarried the famous cane, with a knob studded with turquoises,\ncelebrated in Madame de Girardin's story, \"La Canne de Monsieur de\nBalzac\"; and drove in a tilbury, behind a high-stepping horse, with a\ntiny tiger, whom he christened Anchise, perched on the back seat. This\nphase was quickly over, the horses were sold, and Balzac appeared no\nmore in the box reserved for dandies at the Opera.

I cannot blame\n     you that ye cannot conjecture what this may be, for God knows it\n     is only a trick of his idle brain, hoping thereby to shift his\n     trial; but it is easy to be seen, that he would threaten me with\n     laying an aspersion upon me of being in some sort accessory to\n     his crime.... Give him assurance in my name, that if he will yet,\n     before his trial, confess cheerily unto the commissioners his\n     guiltiness of this fact, I will not only perform what I promised\n     by my last messenger both towards him and his wife, but I will\n     enlarge it, according to the phrase of the civil law, &c. I mean\n     not, that he shall confess if he be innocent, but ye know how\n     evil likely that is; and of yourself ye may dispute with him what\n     should mean his confidence now to endure a trial, when, as he\n     remembers, that this last winter he confessed to the\n     chief-justice that his cause was so evil likely as he knew no\n     jury could acquit him. Assure him, that I protest upon my honour\n     my end in this is for his and his wife's good. Ye will do well,\n     likewise, of yourself, to cast out unto him, that ye fear his\n     wife shall plead weakly for his innocency; and that ye find the\n     commissioners have, ye know not how, some secret assurance that\n     in the end she will confess of him--but this must only be as from\n     yourself.'\n\nThat there was some secret of the divulgence of which the king was in\nthe utmost terror, is thus beyond a doubt. What, then, was it? There\nare no means of deciding. James, it will be seen, hints to Moore, that\nit was a charge of accession to the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury.\nBut, in the same letter, James lets us see that Moore himself did not\nknow the exact secret; and we may fairly conjecture, that the hint was\nintended to put him on a wrong scent.\n\nThe earl and countess were permitted to live, spending a miserable\nexistence with the fear of punishment hanging over them.

But this essay stands alone, at all events in English,\nas an attempt to take Casanova seriously, to show him in his relation to his time, and in his\nrelation to human problems. And yet these Memoirs are perhaps the most valuable document which\nwe possess on the society of the eighteenth century; they are the history of a unique life,\na unique personality, one of the greatest of autobiographies; as a record of adventures, they\nare more entertaining than Gil Blas, or Monte Cristo, or any of the imaginary travels, and\nescapes, and masquerades in life, which have been written in imitation of them. They tell the\nstory of a man who loved life passionately for its own sake: one to whom woman was, indeed,\nthe most important thing in the world, but to whom nothing in the world was indifferent. The\nbust which gives us the most lively notion of him shows us a great, vivid, intellectual face,\nfull of fiery energy and calm resource, the face of a thinker and a fighter in one. A scholar,\nan adventurer, perhaps a Cabalist, a busy stirrer in politics, a gamester, one 'born for the\nfairer sex,' as he tells us, and born also to be a vagabond; this man, who is remembered now\nfor his written account of his own life, was that rarest kind of autobiographer, one who did\nnot live to write, but wrote because he had lived, and when he could live no longer.\n\nAnd his Memoirs take one all over Europe, giving sidelights, all the more valuable in being\nalmost accidental, upon many of the affairs and people most interesting to us during two-thirds\nof the eighteenth century. Giacomo Casanova was born in Venice, of Spanish and Italian parentage,\non April 2, 1725; he died at the Chateau of Dux, in Bohemia, on June 4, 1798. In that lifetime\nof seventy-three years he travelled, as his Memoirs show us, in Italy, France, Germany, Austria,\nEngland, Switzerland, Belgium, Russia, Poland, Spain, Holland, Turkey; he met Voltaire at Ferney,\nRousseau at Montmorency, Fontenelle, d'Alembert and Crebillon at Paris, George III."}

Well, he prophesied stuff like this: 'When the\nowl and the eagle meet on the same blasted rowan tree, then a lassie in a\nwhite hood from the east shall make the burn of Cross-cleugh run full\nred,' and drivel of that insane kind.  Well, you can't think what trouble\nthat particular prophecy gave me.  It had to be fulfilled, of course, for\nthe family credit, and I brought it off as near as, I flatter myself, it\ncould be done.\"\n\n\"Lady Perilous was telling me about it last night,\" I said, with a\nshudder.  \"It was a horrible affair,\"\n\n\"Yes, no doubt, no doubt; a cruel business!  But how I am to manage some\nof them I'm sure _I_ don't know.  There's one of them in rhyme.  Let me\nsee, how does it go?\n\n   \"'When Mackenzie lies in the perilous ha',\n   The wild Red Cock on the roof shall craw,\n   And the lady shall flee ere the day shall daw,\n   And the land shall girn in the deed man's thraw.'\n\n\"The 'crowing of the wild Red Cock' means that the castle shall be burned\ndown, of course (I'm beginning to know his style by this time), and the\nlady is to elope, and the laird--that's Lord Perilous--is to expire in\nthe 'deed man's thraw': that is the name the old people give the Secret\nRoom.  And all this is to happen when a Mackenzie, a member of a clan\nwith which we are at feud, sleeps in the Haunted Chamber--where we are\njust now.  By the way, what is _your_ name?\"\n\nI don't know what made me reply, \"Allan Mackenzie.\"  It was true, but it\nwas not politic.\n\n\"By Jove!\" said the spectre, eagerly.  \"Here's a chance!  I don't suppose\na Mackenzie has slept here for those hundred years.  And now, how is it\nto be done?  Setting fire to the castle is simple\"--here I remembered how\nhe had lighted my cigarette--\"but who on earth is to elope with Lady\nPerilous?  She's fifty if she's a day, and evangelical a tout casser!  Oh\nno; the thing is out of the question.  It really must be put off for\nanother generation or two.  There is no hurry.\"\n\nI felt a good deal relieved.  He was clearly a being of extraordinary\npowers, and might, for anything I knew, have made _me_ run away with Lady\nPerilous.  And then, when the pangs of remorse began to tell on her\nladyship, never a very lively woman at the best of times--However, the\nspectre seemed to have thought better of it.\n\n\"Don't you think it is rather hard on a family,\" I asked, \"to have a\nfamily genius, and prophecies, and a curse, and--\"\n\n\"And everything handsome about them,\" he interrupted me by exclaiming;\n\"and you call yourself a Mackenzie of Megasky!  What has become of family\npride?  Why, you yourselves have Gruagach of the Red Hand in the hall,\nand he, I can tell you, is a very different sort of spectre from _me_.\nPre-Christian, you know--one of the oldest ghosts in Ross-shire.  But as\nto 'hard on a family,' why, noblesse oblige.\"\n\n\"Considering that you are the family genius, you don't seem to have\nbrought them much luck,\" I put in, for the house of Perilous is neither\nrich in gold nor very distinguished in history.\n\n\"Yes, but just think what they would have been without a family genius,\nif they are what they are with one!  Besides, the prophecies are really\nresponsible,\" he added, with the air of one who says, \"I have a\npartner--Mr. Jorkins.\"\n\n\"Do you mind telling me one thing?\" I asked eagerly.  \"What is the\nmystery of the Secret Chamber--I mean the room whither the heir is taken\nwhen he comes of age, and he never smiles again, nor touches a card\nexcept at baccarat?\"\n\n\"Never smiles _again_!\" said the spectre.  \"Doesn't he?  Are you quite\ncertain that he ever smiled _before_?\"\n\nThis was a new way of looking at the question, and rather disconcerted\nme.\n\n\"I did not know the Master of Perilous before he came of age,\" said I;\n\"but I have been here for a week, and watched him and Lord Perilous, and\nI never observed a smile wander over their lips.  And yet little\nTompkins\" (he was the chief social buffoon of the hour) \"has been in\ngreat force, and I may say that I myself have occasionally provoked a\ngrin from the good-natured.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" said the spectre.  \"The Perilouses have no sense of\nhumour--never had.  I am entirely destitute of it myself.  Even in\nScotland, even _here_, this family failing has been remarked--been the\nsubject, I may say, of unfavourable comment.  The Perilous of the period\nlost his head because he did not see the point of a conundrum of\nMacbeth's.  We felt, some time in the fifteenth century, that this\npeculiarity needed to be honourably accounted for, and the family\ndeveloped that story of the Secret Chamber, and the Horror in the house.\nThere is nothing in the chamber whatever,--neither a family idiot aged\nthree hundred years, nor a skeleton, nor the devil, nor a wizard, nor\nmissing title-deeds.  The affair is a mere formality to account\ncreditably for the fact that we never see anything to laugh at--never see\nthe joke.  Some people can't see ghosts, you know\" (lucky people! thought\nI), \"and some can't see jokes.\"\n\n\"This is very disappointing,\" I said.\n\n\"I can't help it,\" said the spectre; \"the truth often is.  Did you ever\nhear the explanation of the haunted house in Berkeley Square?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.  \"The bell was heard to ring thrice with terrific\nvehemence, and on rushing to the fatal scene they found him beautiful in\ndeath.\"\n\n\"Fudge!\" replied the spectre.  \"The lease and furniture were left to an\nold lady, who was not to underlet the house nor sell the things.  She had\na house of her own in Albemarle Street which she preferred, and so the\nhouse in Berkeley Square was never let till the lease expired.  That's\nthe whole affair.  The house was empty, and political economists could\nconceive no reason for the waste of rent except that it was haunted.  The\nrest was all Miss Broughton's imagination, in 'Tales for Christmas Eve.'\"\n\nHe had evidently got on his hobby, and was beginning to be rather\ntedious.  The contempt which a genuine old family ghost has for mere\nparvenus and impostors is not to be expressed in mere words apparently,\nfor Mauth-hounds of prodigious size and blackness, with white birds, and\nother disastrous omens, now began to display themselves profusely in the\nHaunted Chamber.  Accustomed as I had become to regard all these\nappearances as mere automatic symptoms, I confess that I heard with\npleasure the crow of a distant cock.\n\n\"You have enabled me to pass a most instructive evening, most agreeable,\ntoo, I am sure,\" I remarked to the spectre, \"but you will pardon me for\nobserving that the first cock has gone.  Don't let me make you too late\nfor any appointment you may have about this time--anywhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, you still believe in that old superstition about cock-crow, do you?\"\nhe sneered.  \"'I thought you had been too well educated.  'It faded on\nthe crowing of the cock,' did it, indeed, and that in Denmark too,--almost\nwithin the Arctic Circle!  Why, in those high latitudes, and in summer, a\nghost would not have an hour to himself on these principles.  Don't you\nremember the cock Lord Dufferin took North with him, which crowed at\nsunrise, and ended by crowing without intermission and going mad, when\nthe sun did not set at all?  You must observe that any rule of that sort\nabout cock-crow would lead to shocking irregularities, and to an early-\nclosing movement for spectres in summer, which would be ruinous to\nbusiness--simply ruinous--and, in these days of competition,\nintolerable.\"\n\nThis was awful, for I could see no way of getting rid of him.  He might\nstay to breakfast, or anything.\n\n\"By the way,\" he asked, \"who does the Cock at the Lyceum just now?  It is\na small but very exacting part--'Act I. scene I.  Cock crows.'\"\n\n\"I believe Mr. Irving has engaged a real fowl, to crow at the right\nmoment behind the scenes,\" I said.  \"He is always very particular about\nthese details.  Quite right too.  'The Cock, by kind permission of the\nAylesbury Dairy Company,' is on the bills.  They have no Cock at the\nFrancais; Mounet Sully would not hear of it.\"\n\nI knew nothing about it, but if this detestable spectre was going to\nlaunch out concerning art and the drama there would be no sleep for me.\n\n\"Then the glow-worm,\" he said--\"have they a real glow-worm for the\nGhost's 'business' (Act I. scene 5) when he says?--\n\n         \"'Fare thee well at once,\n   The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,\n   And 'gins to pale his ineffectual fire.'\n\nDid it ever strike you how inconsistent that is?  Clearly the ghost\nappeared in winter; don't you remember how they keep complaining of the\nweather?\n\n   \"'For this relief much thanks; 'tis bitter cold,'\n\nand\n\n   \"'The air bites shrewdly: it is very cold.'\"\n\n\"Horatio blows on his hands to warm them, at the Francais,\" I\ninterrupted.\n\n\"Quite right; good business,\" said he; \"and yet they go on about the glow-\nworms in the neighbourhood!  Most incongruous.  How does Furnivall take\nit?  An interpolation by Middleton?\"\n\nI don't like to be rude, but I admit that I hate being bothered about\nShakespeare, and I yawned.\n\n\"Good night,\" he said snappishly, and was gone.\n\nPresently I heard him again, just as I was dropping into a doze.\n\n\"You won't think, in the morning, that this was all a dream, will you?\nCan I do anything to impress it on your memory?  Suppose I shrivel your\nleft wrist with a touch of my hand?  Or shall I leave 'a sable score of\nfingers four' burned on the table?  Something of that sort is usually\ndone.\"\n\n\"Oh, _pray_ don't take the trouble,\" I said.  \"I'm sure Lady Perilous\nwould not like to have the table injured, and she might not altogether\nbelieve my explanation.  As for myself, I'll be content with your word\nfor it that you were really here.  Can I bury your bones for you, or\nanything?  Very well, as you _must_ be off, good night!\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" he replied.  \"By the way, I've had an idea about my\napparitions in disguise.  Perhaps it is my 'Unconscious Self' that does\nthem.  You have read about the 'Unconscious Self' in the Spectator?\"\n\nThen he really went.\n\nA nun in grey, who moaned and wrung her hands, remained in the room for a\nshort time, but was obviously quite automatic.\n\nI slept till the hot water was brought in the morning.\n\n\nTHE GREAT GLADSTONE MYTH. {283}\n\n\nIn the post-Christian myths of the Teutonic race settled in England, no\nfigure appears more frequently and more mysteriously than that of\nGladstone or Mista Gladstone.  To unravel the true germinal conception of\nGladstone, and to assign to all the later accretions of myth their\nprovenance and epoch, are the problems attempted in this chapter.  It is\nalmost needless (when we consider the perversity of men and the lasting\nnature of prejudice) to remark that some still see in Gladstone a shadowy\nhistorical figure.  Just as our glorious mythical Bismarck has been\nfalsely interpreted as the shadowy traditional Arminius (the Arminius of\nTacitus, not of Leo Adolescens), projected on the mists of the Brocken,\nso Gladstone has been recognized as a human hero of the Fourth Dynasty.\nIn this capacity he has been identified with Gordon (probably the north\nwind), with Spurgeon, {284} whom I have elsewhere shown to be a river\ngod, and with Livingstone.  In the last case the identity of the suffix\n\"stone,\" and the resemblance of the ideas of \"joy\" and of \"vitality,\"\nlend some air of speciousness to a fundamental error.  Livingstone is\nohne zweifel, a mythical form of the midnight sun, now fabled to wander\nin the \"Dark Continent,\" as Bishop of Natal, the land of the sun's\nbirthplace, now alluded to as lost in the cloud-land of comparative\nmythology.  Of all these cobwebs spun by the spiders of sciolism, the\nEuhemeristic or Spencerian view--that Gladstone is an historical\npersonage--has attracted most attention.  Unluckily for its advocates,\nthe whole contemporary documents of the Victorian Dynasty have perished.\nWhen an over-educated and over-rated populace, headed by two mythical\nfigures, Wat Tyler and one Jo, {285a} rose in fury against the School\nBoards and the Department, they left nothing but tattered fragments of\nthe literature of the time.  Consequently we are forced to reconstruct\nthe Gladstonian myth by the comparative method--that is, by comparing the\nrelics of old Ritual treatises, hymns, imprecations, and similar\nreligious texts, with works of art, altars, and statues, and with popular\ntraditions and folklore.  The results, again, are examined in the light\nof the Vedas, the Egyptian monuments, and generally of everything that,\nto the unscientific eye, seems most turbidly obscure in itself, and most\nhopelessly remote from the subject in hand.  The aid of Philology will\nnot be rejected because Longus, or Longinus, has {285b} meanly argued\nthat her services must be accepted with cautious diffidence.  On the\ncontrary, Philology is the only real key to the labyrinths of\npost-Christian myth.\n\nThe philological analysis of the name of Gladstone is attempted, with\nvery various results, by Roth, Kuhn, Schwartz, and other contemporary\ndescendants of the old scholars.  Roth finds in \"Glad\" the Scotch word\n\"gled,\" a hawk or falcon.  He then adduces the examples of the\nHawk-Indra, from the Rig Veda, and of the Hawk-headed Osiris, both of\nthem indubitably personifications of the sun.  On the other hand, Kuhn,\nwith Schwartz, fixes his attention on the suffix \"stone,\" and quotes,\nfrom a fragment attributed to Shakespeare, \"the all-dreaded\nthunder-stone.\"  Schwartz and Kuhn conclude, in harmony with their\ngeneral system, that Gladstone is really and primarily the thunderbolt,\nand secondarily the spirit of the tempest.  They quote an isolated line\nfrom an early lay about the \"Pilot who weathered the storm,\" which they\napply to Gladstone in his human or political aspect, when the\nstorm-spirit had been anthropomorphised, and was regarded as an ancestral\npolitician.  But such scanty folklore as we possess assures us that the\nstorm, on the other hand, weathered Gladstone; and that the poem quoted\nrefers to quite another person, also named William, and probably\nidentical with William Tell--that is, with the sun, which of course\nbrings us back to Roth's view of the hawk, or solar Gladstone, though\nthis argument in his own favour has been neglected by the learned\nmythologist.  He might also, if he cared, adduce the solar stone of\nDelphi, fabled to have been swallowed by Cronus.  Kuhn, indeed, lends an\ninvoluntary assent to this conclusion (Ueber Entwick. der Myth.) when he\nasserts that the stone swallowed by Cronus was the setting sun.  Thus we\nhave only to combine our information to see how correct is the view of\nRoth, and how much to be preferred to that of Schwartz and Kuhn.\nGladstone, philologically considered, is the \"hawkstone,\" combining with\nthe attributes of the Hawk-Indra and Hawk-Osiris those of the Delphian\nsun-stone, which we also find in the Egyptian Ritual for the Dead. {287}\nThe ludicrous theory that Gladstone is a territorial surname, derived\nfrom some place (\"Gledstane\" Falkenstein), can only be broached by men\nignorant of even the grammar of science; dabblers who mark with a pencil\nthe pages of travellers and missionaries.  We conclude, then, that\nGladstone is, primarily, the hawk-sun, or sun-hawk.\n\nFrom philology we turn to the examination of literary fragments, which\nwill necessarily establish our already secured position (that Gladstone\nis the sun), or so much the worse for the fragments.  These have reached\nus in the shape of burned and torn scraps of paper, covered with printed\ntexts, which resolve themselves into hymns, and imprecations or curses.\nIt appears to have been the custom of the worshippers of Gladstone to\nsalute his rising, at each dawn, with printed outcries of adoration and\ndelight, resembling in character the Osirian hymns.  These are sometimes\ncouched in rhythmical language, as when we read--\n\n   \"[Gla] dstone, the pillar of the People's hopes,\"--\n\nto be compared with a very old text, referring obscurely to \"the People's\nWilliam,\" and \"a popular Bill,\" doubtless one and the same thing, as has\noften been remarked.  Among the epithets of Gladstone which occur in the\nhymns, we find \"versatile,\" \"accomplished,\" \"philanthropic,\" \"patriotic,\"\n\"statesmanlike,\" \"subtle,\" \"eloquent,\" \"illustrious,\" \"persuasive,\"\n\"brilliant,\" \"clear,\" \"unambiguous,\" \"resolute.\"  All of those are\nobviously intelligible only when applied to the sun.  At the same time we\nnote a fragmentary curse of the greatest importance, in which Gladstone\nis declared to be the beloved object of \"the Divine Figure from the\nNorth,\" or \"the Great White Czar.\"  This puzzled the learned, till a\nfragment of a mythological disquisition was recently unearthed.  In this\ntext it was stated, on the authority of Brinton, that \"the Great White\nHare\" worshipped by the Red Indians was really, when correctly\nunderstood, the Dawn.  It is needless to observe (when one is addressing\nstudents) that \"Great White Hare\" (in Algonkin, Manibozho) becomes Great\nWhite Czar in Victorian English.  Thus the Divine Figure from the North,\nor White Czar, with whom Gladstone is mythically associated, turns out to\nbe the Great White Hare, or Dawn Hero, of the Algonkins.  The sun\n(Gladstone) may naturally and reasonably be spoken of in mythical\nlanguage as the \"Friend of the Dawn.\"  This proverbial expression came to\nbe misunderstood, and we hear of a Liberal statesman, Gladstone, and of\nhis affection for a Russian despot."}

We still saw\ngroves of mulberry and olive trees, from which the finest oil is obtained, and fields of maize\nand hemp, interspersed with meadows.  Beyond Stra the cultivation of rice commences; and, although\nthe rice-fields must render the country unhealthy, still it has not the reputation of being\nmore so than any other.

But he was at the time of the offer in the thick\nof his first difficulties on account of Messrs.

In 1806, in the squib\nhe wrote on Lord Melville's acquittal, when impeached for corruption\nby the Liberal Government, he had written thus of the Princess\nCaroline:--\n\n    \"Our King, too--our Princess,--I dare not say more, sir,--\n      May Providence watch them with mercy and might!\n    While there's one Scottish hand that can wag a claymore, sir,\n      They shall ne'er want a friend to stand up for their right.\n            Be damn'd he that dare not--\n            For my part I'll spare not\n        To beauty afflicted a tribute to give;\n            Fill it up steadily,\n            Drink it off readily,\n        Here's to the Princess, and long may she live.\"\n\nBut whoever \"stood up\" for the Princess's right, certainly Scott did\nnot do so after his intimacy with the Prince Regent began. He\nmentioned her only with severity, and in one letter at least, written\nto his brother, with something much coarser than severity;[45] but the\nking's similar vices did not at all alienate him from what at least\nhad all the appearance of a deep personal devotion to his sovereign.\nThe first baronet whom George IV. made on succeeding to the throne,\nafter his long Regency, was Scott, who not only accepted the honour\ngratefully, but dwelt with extreme pride on the fact that it was\noffered to him by the king himself, and was in no way due to the\nprompting of any minister's advice. He wrote to Joanna Baillie on\nhearing of the Regent's intention--for the offer was made by the\nRegent at the end of 1818, though it was not actually conferred till\nafter George's accession, namely, on the 30th March, 1820,--\"The Duke\nof Buccleuch and Scott of Harden, who, as the heads of my clan and the\nsources of my gentry, are good judges of what I ought to do, have both\ngiven me their earnest opinion to accept of an honour directly derived\nfrom the source of honour, and neither begged nor bought, as is the\nusual fashion. Several of my ancestors bore the title in the\nseventeenth century, and, were it of consequence, I have no reason to\nbe ashamed of the decent and respectable persons who connect me with\nthat period when they carried into the field, like Madoc,\n\n    \"The Crescent at whose gleam the Cambrian oft,\n    Cursing his perilous tenure, wound his horn,\"\n\nso that, as a gentleman, I may stand on as good a footing as other new\ncreations.\"[46] Why the honour was any greater for coming from such a\nking as George, than it would have been if it had been suggested by\nLord Sidmouth, or even Lord Liverpool,--or half as great as if Mr.\nCanning had proposed it, it is not easy to conceive. George was a fair\njudge of literary merit, but not one to be compared for a moment with\nthat great orator and wit; and as to his being the fountain of honour,\nthere was so much dishonour of which the king was certainly the\nfountain too, that I do not think it was very easy for two fountains\nboth springing from such a person to have flowed quite unmingled.\nGeorge justly prided himself on Sir Walter Scott's having been the\nfirst creation of his reign, and I think the event showed that the\npoet was the fountain of much more honour for the king, than the king\nwas for the poet.\n\nWhen George came to Edinburgh in 1822, it was Sir Walter who acted\nvirtually as the master of the ceremonies, and to whom it was chiefly\ndue that the visit was so successful. It was then that George clad his\nsubstantial person for the first time in the Highland costume--to wit,\nin the Steuart Tartans--and was so much annoyed to find himself\noutvied by a wealthy alderman, Sir William Curtis, who had gone and\ndone likewise, and, in his equally grand Steuart Tartans, seemed a\nkind of parody of the king. The day on which the king arrived,\nTuesday, 14th of August, 1822, was also the day on which Scott's most\nintimate friend, William Erskine, then Lord Kinnedder, died. Yet Scott\nwent on board the royal yacht, was most graciously received by George,\nhad his health drunk by the king in a bottle of Highland whiskey, and\nwith a proper show of devoted loyalty entreated to be allowed to\nretain the glass out of which his Majesty had just drunk his health.\nThe request was graciously acceded to, but let it be pleaded on\nScott's behalf, that on reaching home and finding there his friend\nCrabbe the poet, he sat down on the royal gift, and crushed it to\natoms. One would hope that he was really thinking more even of Crabbe,\nand much more of Erskine, than of the royal favour for which he had\nappeared, and doubtless had really believed himself, so grateful. Sir\nWalter retained his regard for the king, such as it was, to the last,\nand even persuaded himself that George's death would be a great\npolitical calamity for the nation. And really I cannot help thinking\nthat Scott believed more in the king, than he did in his friend George\nCanning. Assuredly, greatly as he admired Canning, he condemned him\nmore and more as Canning grew more liberal, and sometimes speaks of\nhis veerings in that direction with positive asperity. George, on the\nother hand, who believed more in number one than in any other number,\nhowever large, became much more conservative after he became Regent\nthan he was before, and as he grew more conservative Scott grew more\nconservative likewise, till he came to think this particular king\nalmost a pillar of the Constitution. I suppose we ought to explain\nthis little bit of fetish-worship in Scott much as we should the\nquaint practical adhesion to duelling which he gave as an old man, who\nhad had all his life much more to do with the pen than the sword--that\nis, as an evidence of the tendency of an improved type to recur to\nthat of the old wild stock on which it had been grafted. But certainly\nno feudal devotion of his ancestors to their chief was ever less\njustified by moral qualities than Scott's loyal devotion to the\nfountain of honour as embodied in \"our fat friend.\" The whole relation\nto George was a grotesque thread in Scott's life; and I cannot quite\nforgive him for the utterly conventional severity with which he threw\nover his first patron, the Queen, for sins which were certainly not\ngrosser, if they were not much less gross, than those of his second\npatron, the husband who had set her the example which she faithfully,\nthough at a distance, followed.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 45: Lockhart's _Life of Scott_, vi. 229-30.]\n\n[Footnote 46: Lockhart's _Life of Scott_, vi. 13, 14.]\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nSCOTT AS A POLITICIAN.\n\n\nScott usually professed great ignorance of politics, and did what he\ncould to hold aloof from a world in which his feelings were very\neasily heated, while his knowledge was apt to be very imperfect. But\nnow and again, and notably towards the close of his life, he got\nhimself mixed up in politics, and I need hardly say that it was always\non the Tory, and generally on the red-hot Tory, side. His first hasty\nintervention in politics was the song I have just referred to on Lord\nMelville's acquittal, during the short Whig administration of 1806. In\nfact Scott's comparative abstinence from politics was due, I believe,\nchiefly to the fact that during almost the whole of his literary life,\nTories and not Whigs were in power. No sooner was any reform proposed,\nany abuse threatened, than Scott's eager Conservative spirit flashed\nup. Proposals were made in 1806 for changes--and, as it was thought,\nreforms--in the Scotch Courts of Law, and Scott immediately saw\nsomething like national calamity in the prospect. The mild proposals\nin question were discussed at a meeting of the Faculty of Advocates,\nwhen Scott made a speech longer than he had ever before delivered, and\nanimated by a \"flow and energy of eloquence\" for which those who were\naccustomed to hear his debating speeches were quite unprepared. He\nwalked home between two of the reformers, Mr. Jeffrey and another,\nwhen his companions began to compliment him on his eloquence, and to\nspeak playfully of its subject. But Scott was in no mood for\nplayfulness. \"No, no,\" he exclaimed, \"'tis no laughing matter; little\nby little, whatever your wishes may be, you will destroy and\nundermine, until nothing of what makes Scotland Scotland shall\nremain!\" \"And so saying,\" adds Mr. Lockhart, \"he turned round to\nconceal his agitation, but not until Mr. Jeffrey saw tears gushing\ndown his cheek,--resting his head, until he recovered himself, on the\nwall of the Mound.\"[47] It was the same strong feeling for old Scotch\ninstitutions which broke out so quaintly in the midst of his own worst\ntroubles in 1826, on behalf of the Scotch banking-system, when he so\neloquently defended, in the letters of _Malachi Malagrowther_, what\nwould now be called Home-Rule for Scotland, and indeed really defeated\nthe attempt of his friends the Tories, who were the innovators this\ntime, to encroach on those sacred institutions--the Scotch one-pound\nnote, and the private-note circulation of the Scotch banks. But when I\nspeak of Scott as a Home-Ruler, I should add that had not Scotland\nbeen for generations governed to a great extent, and, as he thought\nsuccessfully, by Home-Rule, he was far too good a Conservative to have\napologized for it at all. The basis of his Conservatism was always the\ndanger of undermining a system which had answered so well. In the\nconcluding passages of the letters to which I have just referred, he\ncontrasts \"Theory, a scroll in her hand, full of deep and mysterious\ncombinations of figures, the least failure in any one of which may\nalter the result entirely,\" with \"a practical system successful for\nupwards of a century.\" His vehement and unquailing opposition to\nReform in almost the very last year of his life, when he had already\nsuffered more than one stroke of paralysis, was grounded on precisely\nthe same argument. At Jedburgh, on the 21st March, 1831, he appeared\nin the midst of an angry population (who hooted and jeered at him till\nhe turned round fiercely upon them with the defiance, \"I regard your\ngabble no more than the geese on the green,\") to urge the very same\nprotest. \"We in this district,\" he said, \"are proud, and with reason,\nthat the first chain-bridge was the work of a Scotchman. It still\nhangs where he erected it a pretty long time ago. The French heard of\nour invention, and determined to introduce it, but with great\nimprovements and embellishments. A friend of my own saw the thing\ntried. It was on the Seine at Marly. The French chain-bridge looked\nlighter and airier than the prototype. Every Englishman present was\ndisposed to confess that we had been beaten at our own trade. But\nby-and-by the gates were opened, and the multitude were to pass over.\nIt began to swing rather formidably beneath the pressure of the good\ncompany; and by the time the architect, who led the procession in\ngreat pomp and glory, reached the middle, the whole gave way, and\nhe--worthy, patriotic artist--was the first that got a ducking. They\nhad forgot the middle bolt,--or rather this ingenious person had\nconceived that to be a clumsy-looking feature, which might safely be\ndispensed with, while he put some invisible gimcrack of his own to\nsupply its place.\"[48] It is strange that Sir Walter did not see that\nthis kind of criticism, so far as it applied at all to such an\nexperiment as the Reform Bill, was even more in point as a rebuke to\nthe rashness of the Scotch reformer who hung the first successful\nchain-bridge, than to the rashness of the French reformer of reform\nwho devised an unsuccessful variation on it. The audacity of the first\nexperiment was much the greater, though the competence of the person\nwho made it was the greater also. And as a matter of fact, the\npolitical structure against the supposed insecurity of which Sir\nWalter was protesting, with all the courage of that dauntless though\ndying nature, was made by one who understood his work at least as well\nas the Scotch architect. The tramp of the many multitudes who have\npassed over it has never yet made it to \"swing dangerously,\" and Lord\nRussell in the fulness of his age was but yesterday rejoicing in what\nhe had achieved, and even in what those have achieved who have altered\nhis work in the same spirit in which he designed it.\n\nBut though Sir Walter persuaded himself that his Conservatism was all\nfounded in legitimate distrust of reckless change, there is evidence,\nI think, that at times at least it was due to elements less noble. The\nleast creditable incident in the story of his political life--which\nMr. Lockhart, with his usual candour, did not conceal--was the\nbitterness with which he resented a most natural and reasonable\nParliamentary opposition to an appointment which he had secured for\nhis favourite brother, Tom. In 1810 Scott appointed his brother Tom,\nwho had failed as a Writer to the Signet, to a place vacant under\nhimself as Clerk of Session. He had not given him the best place\nvacant, because he thought it his duty to appoint an official who had\ngrown grey in the service, but he gave Tom Scott this man's place,\nwhich was worth about 250_l._ a year. In the meantime Tom Scott's\naffairs did not render it convenient for him to be come-at-able, and\nhe absented himself, while they were being settled, in the Isle of\nMan. Further, the Commission on the Scotch system of judicature almost\nimmediately reported that his office was one of supererogation, and\nought to be abolished; but, to soften the blow, they proposed to allow\nhim a pension of 130_l._ per annum. This proposal was discussed with\nsome natural jealousy in the House of Lords. Lord Lauderdale thought\nthat when Tom Scott was appointed, it must have been pretty evident\nthat the Commission would propose to abolish his office, and that the\nappointment therefore should not have been made. \"Mr. Thomas Scott,\"\nhe said, \"would have 130_l._ for life as an indemnity for an office\nthe duties of which he never had performed, while those clerks who had\nlaboured for twenty years had no adequate remuneration.\" Lord Holland\nsupported this very reasonable and moderate view of the case; but of\ncourse the Ministry carried their way, and Tom Scott got his unearned\npension. Nevertheless, Scott was furious with Lord Holland. Writing\nsoon after to the happy recipient of this little pension, he says,\n\"Lord Holland has been in Edinburgh, and we met accidentally at a\npublic party. He made up to me, but I remembered his part in your\naffair, and _cut_ him with as little remorse as an old pen.\" Mr.\nLockhart says, on Lord Jeffrey's authority, that the scene was a very\npainful one. Lord Jeffrey himself declared that it was the only\nrudeness of which he ever saw Scott guilty in the course of a\nlife-long familiarity. And it is pleasant to know that he renewed his\ncordiality with Lord Holland in later years, though there is no\nevidence that he ever admitted that he had been in the wrong. But the\nincident shows how very doubtful Sir Walter ought to have felt as to\nthe purity of his Conservatism. It is quite certain that the proposal\nto abolish Tom Scott's office without compensation was not a reckless\nexperiment of a fundamental kind. It was a mere attempt at diminishing\nthe heavy burdens laid on the people for the advantage of a small\nportion of the middle class, and yet Scott resented it with as much\ndisplay of selfish passion--considering his genuine nobility of\nbreeding--as that with which the rude working men of Jedburgh\nafterwards resented his gallant protest against the Reform Bill, and,\nlater again, saluted the dauntless old man with the dastardly cry of\n\"Burk Sir Walter!\" Judged truly, I think Sir Walter's conduct in\ncutting Lord Holland \"with as little remorse as an old pen,\" for\nsimply doing his duty in the House of Lords, was quite as ignoble in\nhim as the bullying and insolence of the democratic party in 1831,\nwhen the dying lion made his last dash at what he regarded as the foes\nof the Constitution. Doubtless he held that the mob, or, as we more\ndecorously say, the residuum, were in some sense the enemies of true\nfreedom. \"I cannot read in history,\" he writes once to Mr. Laidlaw,\n\"of any free State which has been brought to slavery till the rascal\nand uninstructed populace had had their short hour of anarchical\ngovernment, which naturally leads to the stern repose of military\ndespotism.\" But he does not seem ever to have perceived that educated\nmen identify themselves with \"the rascal and uninstructed populace,\"\nwhenever they indulge on behalf of the selfish interests of their own\nclass, passions such as he had indulged in fighting for his brother's\npension. It is not the want of instruction, it is the rascaldom, i. e.\nthe violent _esprit de corps_ of a selfish class, which \"naturally\nleads\" to violent remedies. Such rascaldom exists in all classes, and\nnot least in the class of the cultivated and refined. Generous and\nmagnanimous as Scott was, he was evidently by no means free from the\ngerms of it.\n\nOne more illustration of Scott's political Conservatism, and I may\nleave his political life, which was not indeed his strong side,\nthough, as with all sides of Scott's nature, it had an energy and\nspirit all his own. On the subject of Catholic Emancipation he took a\npeculiar view. As he justly said, he hated bigotry, and would have\nleft the Catholics quite alone, but for the great claims of their\ncreed to interfere with political life. And even so, when the penal\nlaws were once abolished, he would have abolished also the\nrepresentative disabilities, as quite useless, as well as very\nirritating when the iron system of effective repression had ceased.\nBut he disapproved of the abolition of the political parts of the\npenal laws. He thought they would have stamped out Roman Catholicism;\nand whether that were just or unjust, he thought it would have been a\ngreat national service. \"As for Catholic Emancipation,\" he wrote to\nSouthey in 1807, \"I am not, God knows, a bigot in religious matters,\nnor a friend to persecution; but if a particular set of religionists\nare _ipso facto_ connected with foreign politics, and placed under the\nspiritual direction of a class of priests, whose unrivalled dexterity\nand activity are increased by the rules which detach them from the\nrest of the world--I humbly think that we may be excused from\nentrusting to them those places in the State where the influence of\nsuch a clergy, who act under the direction of a passive tool of our\nworst foe, is likely to be attended with the most fatal consequences.\nIf a gentleman chooses to walk about with a couple of pounds of\ngunpowder in his pocket, if I give him the shelter of my roof, I may\nat least be permitted to exclude him from the seat next to the\nfire.\"[49] And in relation to the year 1825, when Scott visited\nIreland, Mr. Lockhart writes, \"He on all occasions expressed manfully\nhis belief that the best thing for Ireland would have been never to\nrelax the strictly _political_ enactments of the penal laws, however\nharsh these might appear. Had they been kept in vigour for another\nhalf-century, it was his conviction that Popery would have been all\nbut extinguished in Ireland. But he thought that after admitting\nRomanists to the elective franchise, it was a vain notion that they\ncould be permanently or advantageously deterred from using that\nfranchise in favour of those of their own persuasion.\"\n\nIn his diary in 1829 he puts the same view still more strongly:--\"I\ncannot get myself to feel at all anxious about the Catholic question.\nI cannot see the use of fighting about the platter, when you have let\nthem snatch the meat off it. I hold Popery to be such a mean and\ndegrading superstition, that I am not sure I could have found myself\nliberal enough for voting the repeal of the penal laws as they existed\nbefore 1780. They must and would, in course of time, have smothered\nPopery; and I confess that I should have seen the old lady of\nBabylon's mouth stopped with pleasure. But now that you have taken the\nplaster off her mouth, and given her free respiration, I cannot see\nthe sense of keeping up the irritation about the claim to sit in\nParliament. Unopposed, the Catholic superstition may sink into dust,\nwith all its absurd ritual and solemnities. Still it is an awful risk.\nThe world is in fact as silly as ever, and a good competence of\nnonsense will always find believers.\"[50] That is the view of a\nstrong and rather unscrupulous politician--a moss-trooper in\npolitics--which Scott certainly was. He was thinking evidently very\nlittle of justice, almost entirely of the most effective means of\nkeeping the Kingdom, the Kingdom which he loved. Had he\nunderstood--what none of the politicians of that day understood--the\nstrength of the Church of Rome as the only consistent exponent of the\nprinciple of Authority in religion, I believe his opposition to\nCatholic emancipation would have been as bitter as his opposition to\nParliamentary reform. But he took for granted that while only \"silly\"\npersons believed in Rome, and only \"infidels\" rejected an\nauthoritative creed altogether, it was quite easy by the exercise of\ncommon sense, to find the true compromise between reason and religious\nhumility. Had Scott lived through the religious controversies of our\nown days, it seems not unlikely that with his vivid imagination, his\nwarm Conservatism, and his rather inadequate critical powers, he might\nhimself have become a Roman Catholic.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 47: Lockhart's _Life of Scott_, ii. 328.]\n\n[Footnote 48: Lockhart's _Life of Scott_, x. 47.]\n\n[Footnote 49: Lockhart's _Life of Scott_, iii. 34.]\n\n[Footnote 50: Ibid., ix. 305.]\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nSCOTT IN ADVERSITY.\n\n\nWith the year 1825 came a financial crisis, and Constable began to\ntremble for his solvency. From the date of his baronetcy Sir Walter\nhad launched out into a considerable increase of expenditure. He got\nplans on a rather large scale in 1821 for the increase of Abbotsford,\nwhich were all carried out. To meet his expenses in this and other\nways he received Constable's bills for \"four unnamed works of\nfiction,\" of which he had not written a line, but which came to exist\nin time, and were called _Peveril of the Peak_, _Quentin Durward_,\n_St. Ronan's Well_, and _Redgauntlet_. Again, in the very year before\nthe crash, 1825, he married his eldest son, the heir to the title, to\na young lady who was herself an heiress, Miss Jobson of Lochore, when\nAbbotsford and its estates were settled, with the reserve of\n10,000_l._, which Sir Walter took power to charge on the property for\npurposes of business. Immediately afterwards he purchased a captaincy\nin the King's Hussars for his son, which cost him 3500_l._ Nor were\nthe obligations he incurred on his own account, or that of his family,\nthe only ones by which he was burdened."}

They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; they are then considered,\ndebated, and perhaps amended in Council, after which they are signed by the king. They are\nthen, so far as they relate to you, the _law of the land_, for the king is the Legislator of\nthe Colonies,\"[119] I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me. I had always understood\nfrom our charters that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to\nthe king for his royal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter\nthem. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent, so neither could\nhe make a law for them without theirs. He assur'd me I was totally mistaken. I did not think\nso, however, and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as to what might be\nthe sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings.\nI recollected that about 20 years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the\nministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions laws in the colonies, but the clause\nwas thrown out by the Commons, for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty,\ntill by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they had refus'd that point of sovereignty\nto the king only that they might reserve it for themselves.\n\n    [118] George Granville or Grenville (1712-1770). As\n    English premier from 1763 to 1765, he introduced the\n    direct taxation of the American Colonies and has\n    sometimes been called the immediate cause of the\n    Revolution.\n\n    [119] This whole passage shows how hopelessly divergent\n    were the English and American views on the relations\n    between the mother country and her colonies. Grenville\n    here made clear that the Americans were to have no voice\n    in making or amending their laws. Parliament and the\n    king were to have absolute power over the colonies. No\n    wonder Franklin was alarmed by this new doctrine. With\n    his keen insight into human nature and his consequent\n    knowledge of American character, he foresaw the\n    inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of\n    England. This conversation with Grenville makes these\n    last pages of the _Autobiography_ one of its most\n    important parts.\n\nAfter some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries, they agreed to a meeting\nwith me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual\ndeclarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had its\nown ideas of what should be meant by _reasonable_. We then went into consideration of our several\npoints of complaint, which I enumerated. The proprietaries justify'd their conduct as well\nas they could, and I the Assembly's. We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other\nin our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement. However, it was concluded that I should\ngive them the heads of our complaints in writing, and they promis'd then to consider them.\nI did so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor, Ferdinand John\nParis, who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring\nproprietary of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for them all\ntheir papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly. He was a proud, angry man, and\nas I had occasionally in the answers of the Assembly treated his papers with some severity,\nthey being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression, he had conceived a mortal\nenmity to me, which discovering itself whenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal\nthat he and I should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves, and refus'd treating\nwith anyone but them. They then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the Attorney\nand Solicitor-General for their opinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswered a year\nwanting eight days, during which time I made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries,\nbut without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the Attorney\nand Solicitor-General. What it was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not\ncommunicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting\nmy paper, complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy\njustification of their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if\nthe Assembly would send out _some person of candour_ to treat with them for that purpose, intimating\nthereby that I was not such.\n\n[Illustration: \"We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to\ndiscourage all hope of agreement\"]\n\nThe want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not having address'd the paper to them\nwith their assum'd titles of True and Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania,\nwhich I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper, the intention of which was only to\nreduce to a certainty by writing, what in conversation I had delivered _viva voce_.\n\nBut during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'r Denny to pass an act taxing\nthe proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people, which was the grand point\nin dispute, they omitted answering the message.\n\nWhen this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by Paris, determined to oppose\nits receiving the royal assent. Accordingly they petitioned the king in Council, and a hearing\nwas appointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act, and two by me in\nsupport of it. They alledg'd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order\nto spare those of the people, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force, and the proprietaries,\nwho were in odium with the people, left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes, they would\ninevitably be ruined. We reply'd that the act had no such intention, and would have no such\neffect. That the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and\nequitably, and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting\nthat of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves. This is the\npurport of what I remember as urged by both sides, except that we insisted strongly on the\nmischievous consequences that must attend a repeal, for that the money, \u00a3100,000, being printed\nand given to the king's use, expended in his service, and now spread among the people, the\nrepeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many, and the total discouragement\nof future grants, and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe,\nmerely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly, was insisted on in the\nstrongest terms. On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel, rose, and beckoning me took me\ninto the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading, and asked me if I was really of\nopinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act. I\nsaid certainly. \"Then,\" says he, \"you can have little objection to enter into an engagement\nto assure that point.\" I answer'd, \"None at all.\" He then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse,\nhis lordship's proposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the purpose was drawn up\nby the Clerk of the Council, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of the\nProvince for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber, where\nfinally the law was allowed to pass. Some changes were however recommended and we also engaged\nthey should be made by a subsequent law, but the Assembly did not think them necessary; for\none year's tax having been levied by the act before the order of Council arrived, they appointed\na committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors, and on this committee they put several\nparticular friends of the proprietaries. After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'd a report\nthat they found the tax had been assess'd with perfect equity.\n\nThe Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the engagement, as an essential\nservice to the Province, since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread over all\nthe country. They gave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietaries were\nenraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'd him out with threats of suing\nhim for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe. He, however, having done\nit at the instance of the General, and for His Majesty's service, and having some powerful\ninterest at court, despis'd the threats and they were never put in execution....

MDCCVI.]\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nELECTRICAL KITE\n\nTo Peter Collinson\n\n[Philadelphia], Oct. 19, 1752.\n\nSir,\n\nAs frequent mention is made in public papers from Europe of the success of the _Philadelphia_\nexperiment for drawing the electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected\non high buildings, &c., it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed, that the same experiment\nhas succeeded in _Philadelphia_, though made in a different and more easy manner, which is\nas follows:\n\nMake a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the arms so long as to reach to the four corners\nof a large, thin silk handkerchief when extended; tie the corners of the handkerchief to the\nextremities of the cross, so you have the body of a kite; which being properly accommodated\nwith a tail, loop, and string, will rise in the air, like those made of paper; but this being\nof silk, is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder-gust without tearing. To the top of\nthe upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or more\nabove the wood. To the end of the twine, next the hand, is to be tied a silk ribbon, and where\nthe silk and twine join, a key may be fastened. This kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust\nappears to be coming on, and the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window,\nor under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet; and care must be taken that the\ntwine does not touch the frame of the door or window. As soon as any of the thunder clouds\ncome over the kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, and the kite, with\nall the twine will be electrified, and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every\nway and be attracted by an approaching finger. And when the rain has wet the kite and twine,\nso that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully from\nthe key on the approach of your knuckle. At this key the phial may be charged; and from electric\nfire thus obtained, spirits may be kindled, and all the electric experiments be performed,\nwhich are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the sameness\nof the electric matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated.\n\nB.

Reproduced from a copy at the New York Public Library.\n\nTHE WAY TO WEALTH\n\n(From \"Father Abraham's Speech,\" forming the preface to Poor _Richard's Almanac_ for 1758.)\n\nIt would be thought a hard Government that should tax its People one-tenth Part of their _Time_,\nto be employed in its Service. But _Idleness_ taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all\nthat is spent in absolute _Sloth_, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent in idle Employments\nor Amusements, that amount to nothing. _Sloth_, by bringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens\nLife. _Sloth, like Rust, consumes faster than Labor wears; while the used key is always bright,\nas Poor Richard says. But dost thou love Life, then do not squander Time, for that's the stuff\nLife is made of, as Poor Richard_ says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep,\nforgetting that _The sleeping Fox catches no Poultry_, and that _There will be sleeping enough\nin the Grave_, as _Poor Richard_ says.\n\n_If Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be, as Poor Richard_ says, _the_\n_greatest Prodigality_; since, as he elsewhere tells us, _Lost Time is never found again; and\nwhat we call Time enough, always proves little enough_: Let us then up and be doing, and doing\nto the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do more with less Perplexity. _Sloth makes all Things\ndifficult, but Industry all easy_, as _Poor Richard_ says; and _He that riseth late must trot\nall Day, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night; while Laziness travels so slowly,\nthat Poverty soon overtakes him_, as we read in _Poor Richard_, who adds, _Drive thy Business,\nlet not that drive thee_; and _Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy,\nand wise._\n\n_Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will die fasting._\n\n_There are no Gains without Pains._\n\n_He that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hath an Office of Profit\nand Honor_; but then the _Trade_ must be worked at, and the _Calling_ well followed, or neither\nthe _Estate_ nor the _Office_ will enable us to pay our Taxes.\n\nWhat though you have found no Treasure, nor has any rich Relation left you a Legacy, _Diligence\nis the Mother of Good-luck_, as _Poor Richard_ says, _and God gives all Things to Industry_.\n\n_One To-day is worth two To-morrows_, and farther, _Have you somewhat to do To-morrow, do it\nTo-day_.\n\nIf you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle? Are\nyou then your own Master, _be ashamed to catch yourself idle_.\n\nStick to it steadily; and you will see great Effects, for _Constant Dropping wears away Stones_,\nand by _Diligence and Patience the Mouse ate in two the Cable_; and _Little Strokes fell great\nOaks_.\n\nMethinks I hear some of you say, _Must a Man afford himself no Leisure_? I will tell thee,\nmy friend, what _Poor Richard_ says, _Employ thy Time well, if thou meanest to gain Leisure;\nand, since thou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour_. Leisure, is Time for doing\nsomething useful; this Leisure the diligent Man will obtain, but the lazy Man never; so that,\nas _Poor Richard_ says, _A Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things_.\n\n_Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee_; and again, _If you would have your business done,\ngo; if not, send._\n\nIf you would have a faithful Servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.\n\n_A little Neglect may breed great Mischief:_ adding, _for want of a Nail the Shoe was lost;\nfor want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and for want of a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken\nand slain by the Enemy; all for the want of Care about a Horse-shoe Nail_.\n\nSo much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one's own Business; but to these we must\nadd _Frugality_.\n\n_What maintains one Vice, would bring up two Children_. You may think perhaps, that a _little_\nTea, or a _little_ Punch now and then, Diet a _little_ more costly, Clothes a _little_ finer,\nand a _little_ Entertainment now and then, can be no _great_ Matter; but remember what _Poor\nRichard_ says, _Many a Little makes a Mickle._\n\n_Beware of little expenses; A small Leak will sink a great Ship_; and again, _Who Dainties\nlove, shall Beggars prove_; and moreover, _Fools make Feasts, and wise Men eat them._\n\nBuy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy Necessaries.\n\nIf you would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some; for, he that goes a borrowing\ngoes a sorrowing.\n\nThe second Vice is Lying, the first is running in Debt.\n\n_Lying rides upon Debt's Back_.\n\nPoverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: '_Tis hard for an empty Bag to stand\nupright_.\n\nAnd now to conclude, _Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools will learn in no other, and\nscarce in that_; for it is true, _we may give Advice, but we cannot give Conduct_, as _Poor\nRichard_ says: However, remember this, _They that won't be counseled, can't be helped_, as\n_Poor Richard_ says: and farther, That _if you will not hear Reason, she'll surely rap your\nKnuckles_.\n\nTHE WHISTLE\n\nTo Madame Brillon\n\nPassy, November 10, 1779.\n\nI am charmed with your description of Paradise, and with your plan of living there; and I approve\nmuch of your conclusion, that, in the meantime, we should draw all the good we can from this\nworld. In my opinion, we might all draw more good from it than we do, and suffer less evil,\nif we would take care not to give too much for whistles. For to me it seems, that most of the\nunhappy people we meet with, are become so by neglect of that caution.\n\nYou ask what I mean? You love stories, and will excuse my telling one of myself.\n\nWhen I was a child of seven year old, my friends, on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers.\nI went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children; and being charmed with the sound\nof a _whistle_, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and\ngave all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased\nwith my _whistle_, but disturbing all the family. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding\nthe bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth; put\nme in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the money; and laughed at\nme so much for my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin\nthan the _whistle_ gave me pleasure.\n\nThis, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuing on my mind; so that often,\nwhen I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, _Don't give too much for\nthe whistle_; and I saved my money.\n\nAs I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many,\nvery many, who _gave too much for the whistle_.\n\nWhen I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time in attendance on levees,\nhis repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends, to attain it, I have said to\nmyself, _This man gives too much for his whistle_.\n\nWhen I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in political bustles, neglecting\nhis own affairs, and ruining them by neglect, _He pays, indeed_, said I, _too much for his\nwhistle_.\n\nIf I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living, all the pleasure of doing good\nto others, all the esteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for\nthe sake of accumulating wealth, _Poor man_, said I, _you pay too much for your whistle_.\n\nWhen I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of\nhis fortune, to mere corporeal sensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, _Mistaken\nman_, said I, _you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you give too much\nfor your whistle_.\n\nIf I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, fine furniture, fine equipages,\nall above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, _Alas_!\nsay I, _he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle_.\n\nWhen I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl married to an ill-natured brute of a husband, _What\na pity_, say I, _that she should pay so much for a whistle_!\n\nIn short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the\nfalse estimates they have made of the value of things, and by their _giving too much for their\nwhistles_.\n\nYet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people, when I consider, that, with all this\nwisdom of which I am boasting, there are certain things in the world so tempting, for example,\nthe apples of King John, which happily are not to be bought; for if they were put to sale by\nauction, I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase, and find that I had once\nmore given too much for the _whistle_.\n\nAdieu, my dear friend, and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with unalterable affection,\n\nB. Franklin.\n\nA LETTER TO SAMUEL MATHER\n\nPassy, May 12, 1784.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nIt is now more than 60 years since I left Boston, but I remember well both your father and\ngrandfather, having heard them both in the pulpit, and seen them in their houses. The last\ntime I saw your father was in the beginning of 1724, when I visited him after my first trip\nto Pennsylvania. He received me in his library, and on my taking leave showed me a shorter\nway out of the house through a narrow passage, which was crossed by a beam overhead. We were\nstill talking as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I turning partly towards him, when\nhe said hastily, \"_Stoop, stoop!_\" I did not understand him, till I felt my head hit against\nthe beam. He was a man that never missed any occasion of giving instruction, and upon this\nhe said to me, \"_You are young, and have the world before you; stoop as you go through it,\nand you will miss many hard thumps_.\" This advice, thus beat into my head, has frequently been\nof use to me; and I often think of it, when I see pride mortified, and misfortunes brought\nupon people by their carrying their heads too high.\n\nB. Franklin.\n\nTHE END\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nThe last and most complete edition of Franklin's works is that by the late Professor Albert\nH. Smyth, published in ten volumes by the Macmillan Company, New York, under the title, _The\nWritings of Benjamin Franklin_. The other standard edition is the _Works of Benjamin Franklin_\nby John Bigelow (New York, 1887). Mr. Bigelow's first edition of the _Autobiography_ in one\nvolume was published by the J. B. Lippincott Company of Philadelphia in 1868. The life of Franklin\nas a writer is well treated by J. B. McMaster in a volume of _The American Men of Letters Series_;\nhis life as a statesman and diplomat, by J. T. Morse, _American Statesmen Series_, one volume;\nHoughton, Mifflin Company publish both books. A more exhaustive account of the life and times\nof Franklin may be found in James Parton's _Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin_ (2 vols.,\nNew York, 1864). Paul Leicester Ford's _The Many-Sided Franklin_ is a most chatty and readable\nbook, replete with anecdotes and excellently and fully illustrated. An excellent criticism\nby Woodrow Wilson introduces an edition of the _Autobiography_ in _The Century Classics_ (Century\nCo., New York, 1901). Interesting magazine articles are those of E. E. Hale, _Christian Examiner_,\nlxxi, 447; W. P. Trent, _McClure's Magazine_, viii, 273; John Hay, _The Century Magazine_,\nlxxi, 447.\n\nSee also the histories of American literature by C. F.

{"ID": 694, "text": "The odds, I figured, were in my\nfavor. A sick engine is useless, and I felt assured of either killing or\ncuring. I did something--I don't know what; but having achieved the\ncomplete screwing up and driving in of things--_it went_!\n\nSo on the morning of the fourth day, we were up early, eager for the\nshooting of rapids. We had understood from the conversation of the\nseemingly wise, that Eagle Rapids was the first of a series that made\nthe other rapids we had passed through look like mere ripples on the\nsurface. In some of those we had gone at a very good clip, and several\ntimes we had lost our rudder.\n\nI remembered how the steamboats used to be obliged to throw out cables\nand slowly wind themselves up with the power of the \"steam nigger.\" I\nalso remembered the words of Father de Smet: \"There are many rapids, ten\nof which are very difficult to ascend and very dangerous to go down.\"\n\nWe had intended from the very first to get wrecked in one or all of\nthese rapids. For this reason we had distributed forward, aft, and\namidships, eight five-gallon cans, soldered air-tight. The frail craft\nwould, we figured, be punctured. The cans would displace nearly three\nhundred and fifty pounds of water, and the boat and engine, submerged,\nwould lose a certain weight. I had made the gruesome calculation with\nfond attention to detail. I decided that she should be wrecked quite\narithmetically. We should be able, the figures said, to recover the\nengine and patch the boat. We had provided three life-preservers, but\none had been stolen; so I had fancied what a bully fight one might have\nif he should be thrown out into the mad waters without a life-preserver.\n\nI have never been able to explain it satisfactorily; it is one of the\nparadoxes; but human nature seems to take a weird delight in placing in\njeopardy that which is dearest. Even a coward with his fingers clenched\ndesperately on the ragged edge of hazard, feels an inexplicable thrill\nof glory. Having several times been decently scared, I know.\n\nOne likes to take a sly peep behind the curtain of the big play, hoping\nperhaps to get a slight hint as to what machinery hoists the moon, and\nwhat sort of contrivance flings the thunder and lightning, and many\nother things that are none of his business. Only, to be sure, he intends\nto get away safely with his information. When you think you see your\nfinish bowing to receive you, something happens in your head. It's like\na sultry sheet of rapid fire lapping up for a moment the thunder-shaken\nnight--and discovering a strange land to you. And it's really good for\nyou.\n\nUnder half speed we cruised through the windless golden morning; and the\nlonesome canyon echoed and re-echoed with the joyful chortle of the\nresurrected engine. We had covered about ten miles, when a strange\nsighing sound grew up about us. It seemed to emanate from the soaring\nwalls of rock. It seemed faint, yet it arose above the din of the\nexplosions, drowned out the droning of the screw.\n\nSteadily the sound increased. Like the ghost of a great wind it moaned\nand sighed about us. Little by little a new note crept in--a sibilant,\nmetallic note as of a tense sheet of silk drawn rapidly over a thin\nsteel edge.\n\n[Illustration: WOLF POINT, THE FIRST TOWN IN 500 MILES.]\n\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE BAD LANDS.]\n\nWe knew it to be the mourning voice of the Eagle Rapids; but far as we\ncould see, the river was quiet as a lake. We jogged on for a mile,\nwith the invisible moaning presence about us. It was somewhat like the\nintangible something you feel about a powerful but sinister personality.\nThe golden morning was saturated with it.\n\nSuddenly, turning a sharp bend about the wall of rock that flanked the\nchannel, a wind of noise struck us. It was like the hissing of\ninnumerable snakes against a tonal background of muffled continuous\nthunder. A hundred yards before us was Eagle Rapids--a forbidding patch\nof writhing, whitening water, pricked with the upward thrust of\ntoothlike rocks.\n\nThe first sight of it turned the inside of me mist-gray. Temporarily,\nwrecks and the arithmetic of them had little charm for me. I seized the\nspark-lever, intending to shut down. Instead, I threw it wide open. With\nthe resulting leap of the craft, all the gray went out of me.\n\nI grasped the rudder ropes and aimed at a point where the sinuous\ncurrent sucked through a passage in the rocks like a lean flame through\na windy flue. Did you ever hear music that made you see purple? It was\nthat sort of purple I saw (or did I hear it like music?) when we plunged\nunder full speed into the first suck of the rapids. We seemed a\nconscious arrow hurled through a gray, writhing world, the light of\nwhich was noise. And then, suddenly, the quiet, golden morning flashed\nback; and we were ripping the placid waters of a lake.\n\nThe Kid broke out into boisterous laughter that irritated me strangely:\n\"Where the devil do you suppose our life-preservers are?\" he bawled.\n\"They're clear down under all the cargo!\"\n\nA world of wonderful beauty was forging past us. In the golden calm, the\nscintillant sheet of water seemed to be rushing backward, splitting\nitself over the prow, like a fabric woven of gold and silver drawn\nrapidly against a keen stationary blade.\n\nThe sheer cliffs had fallen away into pine-clad slopes, and vari-colored\nrocks flung notes of scarlet and gold through the sombre green of the\npines--like the riotous treble cries of an organ pricking the sullen\nmurmur of the bass. So still were the clean waters that we seemed midway\nbetween two skies.\n\nWe skirted the base of a conical rock that towered three hundred feet\nabove us--a Titan sentinel. It was the famous Sentinel Rock of the old\nsteamboat days. I shut the engine down to quarter speed, for somehow\nfrom the dizzy summit a sad dream fell upon me and bade me linger.\n\nI stared down into the cold crystal waters at the base of the rock.\nMany-colored mosses, sickly green, pale, feverish red, yellow like fear,\nblack like despair, purple like the lips of a strangled man, clung\nthere. I remembered an old spring I used to haunt when I was just old\nenough to be awed by the fact of life and frightened at the possibility\nof death. Just such mosses grew in the depths of that spring. I used to\nstare into it for hours.\n\nIt fascinated me in a terrible way. I thought Death looked like that.\nEven now I am afraid I could not swim long in clear waters with those\nfearful colors under me. I am sure they found Ophelia floating like a\nghastly lily in such a place.\n\nFilled with a shadow of the old childish dread, I looked up to the\naustere summit of the Sentinel. Scarred and haggard with time it caught\nthe sun. I thought of how long it had stood there just so, under the\nintermittent flashing of moon and sun and star, since first its flinty\npeak had pricked through the hot spume of prehistoric seas.\n\nFantastic reptiles, winged and finned and fanged, had basked upon\nit--grotesque, tentative vehicles of the Flame of Life! And then these\nflashed out, and the wild sea fell, and the land arose--hideous and\nnaked, a steaming ooze fetid with gasping life. And all the while this\nscarred Sentinel stared unmoved. And then a riot of giant vegetation all\nabout it--divinely extravagant, many-colored as fire. And this too\nflashed out--like the impossible dream of a god too young. And the Great\nChange came, and the paradox of frost was in the world, stripping life\ndown to the lean essentials till only the sane, capable things might\nlive. And still the Titan stared as in the beginning. And then, men were\nin the land--gaunt, terrible, wolf-like men, loving and hating. And La\nVerendrye forged past it; and Lewis and Clark toiled under it through\nthese waters of awful quiet. And then the bull boats and the mackinaws\nand the packets. And all these flashed out; and still it stood unmoved.\nAnd I came--and I too would flash out, and all men after me and all\nlife.\n\nI viewed the colossal watcher with something like terror--the aspect of\ndeath about its base and that cynical glimmer of sunlight at its top. I\nflung the throttle open, and we leaped forward through the river hush.\nI wanted to get away from this thing that had seen so much of life and\ncared so little. It depressed me strangely; it thrust bitter questions\nwithin the charmed circle of my ego. It gave me an almost morbid desire\nfor speed, as though there were some place I should reach before the\nterrible question should be answered against me.\n\nWe fled down five or six miles of depressingly quiet waters. Once again\nthe wall rocks closed about us. We seemed to be going at a tediously\nslow pace, yet the two thin streams of water rushed hissing from prow to\nstern. A strange mood was upon me. Once when I was a boy and far from\nhome, I awoke in the night with a bed of railroad ties under me, and the\nchill black blanket of the darkness about me. I wanted to get up and run\nthrough that damned night--anywhere, just so I went fast\nenough--stopping only when exhaustion should drag me down. And yet I was\nafraid of nothing tangible; hunger and the stranger had sharpened\nwhatever blue steel there was in my nature. I was afraid of being still!\nWere you ever a homesick boy, too proud to tell the truth about it?\n\nI felt something of that boy's ache as we shot in among the wall rocks\nagain. It was a psychic hunger for something that does not exist. Oh, to\nattain the terrible speed one experiences in a fever-dream, to get\nsomewhere before it is too late, before the black curtain drops!\n\nTo some this may sound merely like the grating of overwrought nerves.\nBut it is more than that. All religions grew out of that most human\nmood. And whenever one is deeply moved, he feels it. For even the most\nmatter-of-fact person of us all has now and then a suspicion that this\nlife is merely episodic--that curtain after curtain of darkness is to be\npierced, world after world of consciousness and light to be passed\nthrough.\n\nOnce more the rocks took on grotesque shapes--utterly ultra-human in\ntheir suggestiveness. Those who have marveled at the Hudson's beauty\nshould drop down this lonesome stretch.\n\nWe shot through the Elbow Rapids at the base of the great\nHole-in-the-wall Rock. It was deep and safe--much like an exaggerated\nmill-race. It ran in heavy swells, yet the day was windless.\n\nIn the late afternoon we shot the Dead Man's Rapids, a very turbulent\nand rocky stretch of water. We went through at a freight-train speed,\nand began to develop a slight contempt for fast waters. That night we\ncamped at the mouth of the Judith River on the site of the now forgotten\nFort Chardon. We had made only ninety-eight miles in four days. It began\nto appear that we might be obliged to finish on skates!\n\nWe were up and off with the first gray of the morning. We knew Dauphin\nRapids to be about seventeen miles below, and since this particular\npatch of water had by far the greatest reputation of all the rapids, we\nwere eager to make its acquaintance.\n\nThe engine began to show unmistakable signs of getting tired of its job.\nNow and then it barked spitefully, had half a notion to stop, changed\nits mind, ran faster than it should, wheezed and slowed down--acting in\nan altogether unreasonable way. But it kept the screw humming\nnevertheless.\n\nFortunately it was going at a mad clip when we sighted the Dauphin.\nThere was not that sibilance and thunder that had turned me a bit gray\ninside at first sight of the Eagle. The channel was narrow, and no rocks\nappeared above the surface. But speed _was_ there; and the almost\nnoiseless rolling of the swift flood ahead had a more formidable\nappearance than that of the Eagle. Rocks above the surface are not much\nto be feared when you have power and a good rudder. But we drew about\ntwenty-two inches of water, and I thought of the rocks under the\nsurface.\n\nI had, however, only a moment to think, for we were already traveling a\ngood eighteen miles, and when the main swirl of the rapids seized us, we\nno doubt reached twenty-five. I was grasping the rudder ropes and we\nwere all grinning a sort of idiotic satisfaction at the amazing spurt of\nspeed, when----\n\nSomething was about to happen!\n\nThe Kid and I were sitting behind the engine in order to hold her screw\ndown to solid water. Bill, decorated with a grin, sat amidships facing\nus. I caught a pink flash in the swirl just under our bow, and then _it\nhappened_!\n\nThe boat reared like a steeple-chaser taking a fence! The Kid shot\nforward over the engine and knocked the grin off Bill's face! Clinging\ndesperately to the rudder ropes, I saw, for a brief moment, a good\nthree-fourths of the frail craft thrust skyward at an angle of about\nforty-five degrees. Then she stuck her nose in the water and her screw\ncame up, howling like seven devils in the air behind me! Instinctively,\nI struck the spark-lever; the howling stopped,--and we were floating in\nthe slow waters below Dauphin Rapids.\n\nAll the cargo had forged forward, and the persons of Bill and the Kid\nwere considerably tangled. We laughed loud and long. Then we gathered\nourselves up and wondered if she might be taking water under the cargo.\nIt developed that she wasn't. But one of our grub boxes, containing all\nthe bacon, was missing. So were the short oars that we used for paddles.\nWhile we laughed, these had found some convenient hiding-place.\n\nWe had struck a smooth bowlder and leaped over it. A boat with the\nordinary launch construction would have opened at every seam. The light\nspringy tough construction of the _Atom_ had saved her. Whereat I\nthought of the Information Bureau and was well pleased.\n\nAltogether we looked upon the incident as a purple spot. But we were\nmany miles from available bacon, and when, upon trial, the engine\nrefused to make a revolution, we began to get exceedingly hungry for\nmeat.\n\nHaving a dead engine and no paddles, we drifted. We drifted very slowly.\nThe Kid asked if he might not go ashore and drive a stake in the bank.\nFor what purpose? Why, to ascertain whether we were going up or down\nstream! While we drifted in the now blistering sun, we talked about\n_meat_. With a devilish persistence we quite exhausted the subject. We\ndiscussed the best methods for making a beefsteak delicious. It made us\nvery hungry for meat. The Kid announced that he could feel his backbone\nsawing at the front of his shirt. But perhaps that was only the\nhyperbole of youth. Bill confessed that he had once grumbled at his good\nwife for serving the steak too rare. He now stated that at the first\ntelegraph station he would wire for forgiveness. I advised him to wire\nfor money instead and buy meat with it. Personally I felt a sort of\nwistful tenderness for packing-houses.\n\nThat day passed somehow, and the next morning we were still hungry for\nmeat. We spent most of the morning talking about it. In the blistering\nwindless afternoon, we drifted lazily. Now and then we took turns\ncranking the engine.\n\nWe were going stern foremost and I was cranking. We rounded a bend\nwhere the wall rocks sloped back, leaving a narrow arid sagebrush strip\nalong both sides of the stream. I had straightened up to get the kink\nout of my back and mop the sweat out of my eyes, when I saw something\nthat made my stomach turn a double somersault.\n\nA good eight hundred yards down stream at the point of a gravel-bar,\nsomething that looked like and yet unlike a small cluster of drifting,\nleafless brush moved slowly into the water. Now it appeared quite\ndistinct, and now it seemed that a film of oil all but blotted it out. I\nblinked my eyes and peered hard through the baffling yellow glare. Then\nI reached for the rifle and climbed over the gunwhale. I smelled raw\nmeat.\n\nFortunately, we were drifting across a bar, and the slow water came only\nto my shoulders. The thing eight hundred yards away was forging across\nstream by this time--heading for the mouth of a coulee. I saw plainly\nnow that the brush grew out of a head. It was a buck with antlers.\n\nJust below the coulee's mouth, the wall rocks began again. The buck\nwould be obliged to land above the wall rocks, and the drifting boat\nwould keep him going. I reached shore and headed for that coulee. The\nsagebrush concealed me. At the critical moment, I intended to show\nmyself and start him up the steep slope. Thus he would be forced to\napproach me while fleeing me. When I felt that enough time had passed, I\nstood up. The buck, shaking himself like a dog, stood against the yellow\nsandstone at the mouth of the gulch. He saw me, looked back at the\ndrifting boat, and appeared to be undecided.\n\nI wondered what the range might be. Back home in the plowed field where\nI frequently plug tin cans at various long ranges, I would have called\nit six hundred yards--at first. Then suddenly it seemed three or four\nhundred. Like a thing in a dream the buck seemed to waver back and forth\nin the oily sunlight.\n\n\"Call it four hundred and fifty,\" I said to myself, and let drive. A\nspurt of yellow stone-dust leaped from the cliff a foot or so above the\ndeer's back. Only four hundred? But the deer had made up his mind. He\nhad urgent business on the other side of that slope--he appeared to be\noverdue.\n\n[Illustration: FRESH MEAT.]\n\n[Illustration: SUPPER!]\n\nI pumped up another shell and drew fine at four hundred. That time\nhis rump quivered for a second as though a great weight had been dropped\non it. But he went on with increased speed. Once more I let him have it.\nThat time he lost an antler. He had now reached the summit, two hundred\nfeet up at the least.\n\nHe hesitated--seemed to be shivering. I have hunted with a full stomach\nand brought down game. But there's a difference when you are empty. In\nthat moment before you kill, you became the sort of fellow your mother\nwouldn't like. Perhaps the average man would feel a little ashamed to\ntell the truth about that savage moment. I got down on my knee and put a\nfinal soft-nosed ball where it would do the most good. The buck reared,\nstiffened, and came down, tumbling over and over.\n\nThat night we pitched camp under a lone scrubby tree at the mouth of an\narid gulch that led back into the utterly God-forsaken Bad Lands. It was\nthe wilderness indeed. Coyotes howled far away in the night, and diving\nbeaver boomed out in the black stream.\n\nWe built half a dozen fires and swung above them the choice portions of\nour kill. And how we ate--with what glorious appetites!\n\nIt is good to sit with a glad-hearted company flinging words of joyful\nbanter across very tall steins. It is good to draw up to a country table\nat Christmas time with turkey and pumpkin-pies and old-fashioned\npuddings before you, and the ones you love about you. I have been deeply\nhappy with apples and cider before an open fireplace. I have been\npresent when the brilliant sword-play of wit flashed across a banquet\ntable--and it thrilled me. _But_----\n\nThere is no feast like the feast in the open--the feast in the flaring\nlight of a night fire--the feast of your own kill, with the tang of the\nwild and the tang of the smoke in it!\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nGETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS\n\n\nIt all came back there by the smoldering fires--the wonder and the\nbeauty and the awe of being alive. We had eaten hugely--a giant feast.\nThere had been no formalities about that meal. Lying on our blankets\nunder the smoke-drift, we had cut with our jack-knives the tender\nmorsels from a haunch as it roasted. When the haunch was at last cooked\nto the bone, only the bone was left.\n\nHeavy with the feast, I lay on my back watching the gray smoke brush my\nstars that seemed so near. _My stars!_ Soft and gentle and mystical!\nLike a dark-browed Yotun woman wooing the latent giant in me, the night\npressed down. I closed my eyes, and through me ran the sensuous surface\nfires of her dream-wrought limbs. Upon my face the weird magnetic lure\nof ever-nearing, never-kissing lips made soundless music. Like a sister,\nlike a mother she caressed me, lazy with the huge feast; and yet, a\ndrowsy, half-voluptuous joy shimmered and rippled in my veins.\n\nDrowsing and dreaming under the drifting smoke-wrack, I felt the sense\nof time and self drop away from me. No now, no to-morrow, no yesterday,\nno I! Only eternity, one vast whole--sun-shot, star-sprent, love-filled,\nchangeless. And in it all, one spot of consciousness more acute than\nother spots; and that was the something that had eaten hugely, and that\nnow felt the inward-flung glory of it all; the swooning, half-voluptuous\nsense of awe and wonder, the rippling, shimmering, universal joy.\n\nAnd then suddenly and without shock--like the shifting of the wood\nsmoke--the mood veered, and there was nothing but I. Space and eternity\nwere I--vast projections of myself, tingling with my consciousness to\nthe remotest fringe of the outward swinging atom-drift; through\nimmeasurable night, pierced capriciously with shafts of paradoxic day;\nthrough and beyond the awful circle of yearless duration, my ego lived\nand knew itself and thrilled with the glory of being. The slowly\nrevolving Milky Way was only a glory within me; the great woman-star\njeweling the summit of a cliff, was only an ecstasy within me; the\nmurmuring of the river out in the dark was only the singing of my heart;\nand the deep, deep blue of the heavens was only the splendid color of my\nsoul.\n\nBill snored. Among the glowing fires moved the black bulk of the Kid,\nturning the hunks of venison. And then the universe and I, curiously\nmixed, swooned into nothing at all, and I was blinking at a golden glow,\nand from the river came a shouting."}
{"ID": 306, "text": "Their structure is light and elegant, and very\ndifferent from the brick and mortar monstrosities that line the southern outlets of London.\n\nThe engravings on the annexed page represent two of a group seen to advantage from Macclesfield\nBridge, pictured in our 351st Number. The first is\n\nHANOVER LODGE,\n\nthe residence of Colonel Sir Robert Arbuthnot, K.C.B. The architectural simplicity and beauty\nof this mansion can scarcely fail to excite the admiration of the beholder. The entrance is\nby a handsome portico; and the internal accommodations combine all the luxuries of a well-\nproportioned dining-room, and a splendid suite of drawing-rooms, extending above sixty feet\nin length, by eighteen feet in breadth. The upper story comprises nine chambers, bathing-room,\ndressing-rooms, &c.; and the domestic offices are in the first style of completeness.\n\nThe grounds are unusually picturesque, for they have none of the geometrical formalities of\nthe exploded school of landscape-gardening, or of Nature trimmed and tortured into artificial\nembellishment. We have often wondered where the old gardeners acquired their mathematical education;\nthey must have gone about with the square and compasses in their pockets--for knowledge was\nthen clasped up in ponderous folios.\n\nThe second engraving is\n\nGROVE HOUSE,\n\nthe elegant residence of George Bellas Greenough, Esq., built from the designs of Mr. Decimus\nBurton. This is a happy specimen of the villa style of architecture. The garden front, represented\nin the print, is divided into three portions. The centre is a tetrastyle portico of the Ionic\norder, raised on a terrace. Between the columns are three handsome windows. The two wings have\nrecesses, \"the soffites of which are supported by three-quarter columns of the Doric order.\nBetween these columns are niches, each of which contains a statue. The absence of other windows\nand doors from the front,\" (observes Mr. Elmes,) \"gives a remarkable and pleasing _casino_\nor pleasure-house character to the house.\"\n\nThe portico is purely Grecian, and the proportion of the pediment very beautiful. The entrance\nfront also consists of a centre and two wings; but the former has no pediment. The door is\nbeneath a spacious semicircular portico of the true Doric order, which alternates with the\nIonic in the other parts of the building with an effect truly harmonious.\n\nOf the internal arrangements of Grove House we will vouch; but our artist has endeavoured to\nconvey some idea of the natural beauties with which this little temple of art is environed;\nand the engraver has added to the distinctness of the floral embellishments in the foreground.\nAltogether, the effect breathes the freshness and quiet of a rural retreat, although the wealth\nand fashion of a metropolis herd in the same parish, and their gay equipages are probably whirling\nalong the adjacent road.\n\nThe exterior of the \"COLOSSEUM\" (of the interior of which building our last Number contained\na description) was intended for the embellishment of the present Number. Our engraver promised--but,\nas Tillotson quotes in one of his sermons, \"promises and pie-crusts,\" &c. The engraving is,\nhowever, intended for our next MIRROR, with some additional particulars of the interior, &c.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSEVERE FROST.\n\n_(For the Mirror.)_\n\nOn the 25th of December, 1749, a most severe frost commenced; it continued without intermission\nfor several weeks, during which time the people, especially the working classes, experienced\ndreadful hardships. Many travellers were frozen to death in coaches, and even foot passengers,\nin the streets of London, shared the same fate. Numerous ships, barges, and boats, were sunk\nby the furious driving of the ice in the Thames. Great were the distresses of the poor, and\neven those who possessed all the comforts of life, confined themselves within doors, for fear\nof being frozen if they ventured abroad.\n\nThe watermen of the river received great assistance from merchants, and other gentlemen of\nthe Royal Exchange; but the fishermen, gardeners, bricklayers, and others, were reduced to\na miserable extremity. These poor men, presenting a sad aspect, assembled to the number of\nseveral hundreds, and marched through the principal streets of the metropolis, begging for\nbread and clothing. The fishermen carried a boat in mourning, and the unfortunate mechanics\nexhibited their implements and utensils. The citizens of London contributed largely to their\nrelief, as did most of the inhabitants of the main streets through which the melancholy procession\npassed.\n\nG.W.N.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOTWAY, THE POET.\n\n_(To the Editor of the Mirror.)_\n\nAny anecdote relating to, or illustrative of, the works of this great man is a public benefaction;\nand I, in common with all your readers, (no doubt,) feel obliged to your correspondent for\nhis history of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk; at least, so much of it as, it would seem,\nwas connected with the tragedy of the Orphan. Charles Brandon was, as history informs us, a\ngay, young, rattling fellow, a constant exhibitant at all tilts and tournaments at Whitehall\nand elsewhere; courageous, \"wittie and of goodlie persone,\" in fact, a regular dandy of bygone\ndays, a fine gallant, and of course a great favourite of his royal master; but, notwithstanding\nall this, it is not clear to me that Charles Brandon and his brother were the romantic originals\nof Polydore and Castalio. I rather think, if Otway did form his characters on any real occurrence\nof the sort, the distressing event must be laid to the noble family now proprietors of Woburn.\n\nPerhaps the _old nobleman_ misunderstood the duchess-dowager when she explained the picture\nto him; or perhaps her grace did not choose to be _quite_ so communicate as she could have\nbeen, and, therefore, fixed the sad event upon the gay Charley Brandon, in whose constellation\nof gay doings it would, indeed, be a romantic diamond of the first water.\n\nEvery body who knows the gallery at Woburn, must remember the remarkable picture alluded to.\nThere is in the same apartment a very fine whole-length of Charles Brandon; but in no way can\nI see is it connected with the work which has furnished this tragic anecdote. At some distance\nfrom Brandon's portrait appears the first Francis, _Earl of Bedford_, with a long white beard,\nand furred robe, and George, pendant,--an illustrious personage of this house, who discharged\nseveral great offices in the reigns of Mary and Elizabeth. Such was his hospitality, that Elizabeth\nused good-humouredly to say, \"Go to, Frank, go to; it is you make all the beggars.\" He died,\naged 58, on the 28th of July, 1585, the day after his third son, _Francis_, was slain, happily\nunapprized of the misfortune.\n\nNow comes the interesting picture in connexion with Otway and his play. This youth, _Francis_\nand his elder brother, the Lord Edward Russell, are represented in _small_ full-lengths, in\ntwo paintings; and so alike, as scarcely to be distinguished one from the other; both dressed\nin white, close jackets, and black and gold cloaks, and black bonnets. The date by Lord Edward\nis aet. 22, 1573. He is represented grasping in one hand some snakes with this motto, _Fides\nhomini, serpentibus fraus_; and in the back ground he is placed standing in a labyrinth, above\nwhich is inscribed, _Fata viam invenient_. This young nobleman died before his father. His\nbrother _Francis_ has his accompaniments not less singular. A lady, seemingly in distress,\nis represented sitting in the back ground, surrounded with snakes, a dragon, crocodile, and\ncock. At a distance are the sea and a ship under full sail. He, by the attendants, was, perhaps,\nthe Polydore of the history. Edward seems by his motto, _Fides homini, serpentibus fraus_,\nto have been the Castalio, conscious of his own integrity, and indignant at his brother's perfidy.\nThe ship probably alludes to the desertion of the lady. If it conveyed Francis to Scotland,\nit was to his punishment, for he fell on July 27, 1585, in a border affray, the day before\nhis father's death.\n\nThere, make what you like of this. This is how matters stand at the Abbey; but I cannot see\nhow this remarkable picture connects itself with Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. I pause\nfor elucidation.\n\nBEPPO.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nON THE CONSTANCY OF WOMAN.\n\n_(For the Mirror.)_\n\nTrue love has no reserves--LANSDOWNE.\n\nThere is not an accomplishment in the mind of a female more enchanting, nor one which adds\nmore dignity and grace to her person, than constancy. Whatever share of beauty she may be possessed\nof, whether she may have the tinge of Hebe on her cheeks, vying in colour with the damask rose,\nand breath as fragrant--and the graceful and elegant gait of an Ariel--still, unless she is\nendowed with this characteristic of a virtuous and ingenuous mind, all her personal charms\nwill fade away, through neglect, like decaying fruit in autumn. The whole list of female virtues\nare in their kind essential to the felicity of man; but there is such beauty and grandeur of\nsentiment displayed in the exercise of constancy, that it has been justly esteemed by the dramatic\npoets as the chief excellence of their heroines. It nerves the arm of the warrior when absent\nfrom the dear object of his devoted attachment, when he reflects, that his confidence in her\nregard was never misplaced; but yet, amidst the dangers of his profession, he sighs for his\nabode of domestic happiness, where the breath of calumny never entered, and where the wily\nand lustful seducer, if he dared to put his foot, shrunk back aghast with shame and confusion,\nlike Satan when he first beheld the primitive innocence and concord between Adam and Eve in\nthe Garden of Eden. It adds a zest to the toils of the peasant, and his heart expands with\njoy and gratitude when he returns in the evening to his ivy-mantled cottage, and finds his\nwife assiduously engaged in the household duties of his family. And it soothes the mind of\nthe lunatic during the lucid intervals of the aberration of his intellects, and tends more\nthan anything else to restore him to reason. In fact, there is no calamity that is incident\nto man, but that female constancy will assuage. Whether in sickness or health, in prosperity\nor poverty, in mirth or sadness, (vicissitudes which form the common lot of mankind in their\npilgrimage through this life;) the loveliness of this inestimable blessing will shine forth,\nlike the sun on a misty morning, and preserve the even temperature of the mind. To the youthful\nlover it is the polar star that guides him from the shoals and quicksands of vice, among which\nhis wayward fancy and inexperience are too apt to lead him. But in the matrimonial state, the\npleasures arising from the exercise of this virtue are manifold, as it sheds a galaxy of splendour\naround the social hemisphere; for it is such a divine perfection, that Solomon has wisely observed,\nthat\n\n  \"A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband.\"\n\nA husband so blessed in marriage, might exclaim with the lover in one of Terence's comedies,\n\"I protest solemnly that I will never forsake her; no, not if I was sure to contract the enmity\nof mankind by this resolution. Her I made the object of my wishes, and have obtained her; our\ndispositions suit; and I will shake hands with them that would sow dissension betwixt us; for\ndeath, and only death, shall take her from me.\"\n\nThe eulogies of the poets in regard to this amiable trait in the female character, are sublime\nand beautiful; but none, I think, have surpassed in vivid fancy and depth of feeling, that\nof Lord Byron, in his elegant poem of the _Corsair_. The following passage describing the grief\nof Medora on the departure of Conrad, the pirate, is sketched with the pencil of a poet who\nwas transcendently gifted with a knowledge of the inmost recesses of the human heart:--\n\n  \"And is he gone,\"--on sudden solitude\n  How oft that fearful question will intrude?\n  \"'Twas but an instant past--and here he stood!\n  And now\"--without the portal's porch she rush'd,\n  And then at length her tears in freedom gush'd;\n  Big, bright, and fast, unknown to her they fell.\n  But still her lips refus'd to send--\"Farewell!\"\n  \"He's gone!\"--against her heart that hand is driven,\n  Convuls'd and quick--then gently rais'd to heav'n;\n  She look'd and saw the heaving of the main:\n  The white sail set--she dared not look again;\n  But turn'd with sickening soul within the gate--\n  \"It is no dream--and I am desolate!\"\n\n  CANTO I.\n\nThe description of Conrad's return from his piratical cruise, the agony of his mind when he\nfinds that his lovely Medora had fallen a sacrifice to her affectionate regard for him, and\nhis sudden departure in a boat, through despair, is equally grand and powerful, and exhibits\na fine specimen of the influence of female constancy even on the mind of a man like Conrad,\nwho, from the nature of his pursuits, was inured to the infliction of wrongs on his fellow-creatures.\n\nThe anecdote of the behaviour of Arria towards her husband, P\u00e6tus, related by Pliny, is one\nof the greatest instances of constancy and magnanimity of mind to be met with in history. P\u00e6tus\nwas imprisoned, and condemned to die, for joining in a conspiracy against the Emperor, Claudius.\nArria, having provided herself with a dagger, one day observed a more than usual gloom on the\ncountenance of P\u00e6tus, when judging that death by the executioner might be more terrible to\nhim than the field of glory, and perhaps, too, sensible that it was for her sake he wished\nto live, she drew the dagger from her side, and stabbed herself before his eyes. Then instantly\nplucking the weapon from her breast, she presented it to her husband, saying, \"My P\u00e6tus, it\nis not painful!\" Read this, ye votaries of voluptuousness. Reflect upon the fine moral lesson\nof conjugal virtue that is conveyed in this domestic tragedy, ye brutal contemners of female\nchastity, and of every virtue that emits a ray of glory around the social circle of matrimonial\nhappiness! Take into your serious consideration this direful but noble proof of constancy,\nye giddy and thoughtless worshippers at the shrine of beauty, and know, that a virtuous disposition\nis the brightest ornament of the female sex.\n\nThere is another instance of constancy of mind, under oppression, in Otway's tragedy of _Venice\nPreserved_, in a dialogue between Jaffier and Belvidera, where the former questions her with\ngreat tenderness of feeling in regard to her future line of conduct in the gloomy prospect\nof his adverse fortune. She replies to him with great animation and pathos:\n\n  \"Oh, I will love thee, ev'n in madness love thee,\n  Tho' my distracted senses should forsake me!\n  Tho' the bare earth be all our resting place,\n  Its roots our food, some cliff our habitation,\n  I'll make this arm a pillow for thy head,\n  And as thou sighing ly'st, and swell'd with sorrow,\n  Creep to thy bosom, pour the balm of love\n  Into thy soul, and kiss thee to thy rest.\"\n\nThis is a true and beautiful picture of constancy of mind, under those rude blasts of adversity,\nwhich too frequently nip the growth of affection. The only alternative against a decay of passion\non such occasions, is a sufficient portion of virtue, strong and well-grounded love, and constancy\nof mind as firm as the rock. In short, without constancy, there can be neither love, friendship,\nnor virtue, in the world.\n\nJ.P.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCAVE AT BLACKHEATH.\n\n_(To the Editor of the Mirror.)_\n\nAllow me to hand you an account of a very curious cavern at Blackheath, fortuitously discovered\nin the year 1780, and which will form, I have no doubt, a pleasing addition to the valued communication\nof your correspondent _Halbert H_., in the 348th Number of the MIRROR, and prove interesting\nto the greater portion of your numerous readers. It is situated on the hill, (on the left hand\nside from London,) and is a very spacious vaulted cavern, hewn through a solid chalk-stone\nrock, one hundred feet below the surface. The Saxons, on their entrance into Kent, upwards\nof 1,300 years ago, excavated several of these retreats; and during the discord, horrid murders,\nand sanguinary conflicts with the native Britons, for nearly five hundred years, used these\nunderground recesses, not only as safe receptacles for their persons, but also secure depositaries\nfor their wealth and plunder. After these times, history informs us the caves were frequently\nresorted to, and occupied by the disloyal and unprincipled rebels, headed by Jack Cade, in\nthe reign of Henry VI., about A.D. 1400, who infested Blackheath and its neighbourhood, (as\nalso mentioned by your correspondent;) since then by several banditti, called Levellers, in\nthe rebellious times of Oliver Cromwell. The cave consists of three rooms, which are dry, and\nilluminated; in one of which, at the end of the principal entrance, is a well of soft, pure,\nand clear water, which, according to the opinion of several eminent men, is seldom to be met\nwith. The internal structure is similar to the cave under the ruins of Reigate Castle, built\nby the Saxons; where the barons of England, in the year 1212, with their followers, (frequently\namounting to five hundred persons,) held their private meetings, and took up arms, previous\nto their obtaining Magna Charta at Runny Mead, near Egham, in Surrey.\n\nC.J.T.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSTANGING.\n\n_(For the Mirror.)_\n\nThis odd custom is now _vice vers\u00e2_. The stang is of Saxon origin, and is practised in Lancashire,\nCumberland, and Westmoreland, for the purpose of exposing a kind of gyneocracy, or, the wife\nwearing the galligaskins. When it is known (which it generally is) that a wife falls out with\nher spouse, and beats him right well, the people of the town or village procure a ladder, and\ninstantly repair to his house, where one of the party is powdered with flour--face blacked--cocked\nhat placed upon his cranium--white sheet thrown over his shoulders--is seated astride the ladder,\nwith his back where his face should be--they hoist him upon men's shoulders--and in his hands\nhe carries a long brush, tongs, and poker. A sort of mock proclamation is then made in doggerel\nverse at the door of all the alehouses in the parish, or wapentake, as follows:--\n\n  \"It is neither for your sake nor my sake\n    That I ride stang;\n  But it is for Nancy Thomson,\n    Who did her husband hang.\n  But if I hear tell that she doth rebel,\n  Or him to complain, with fife and drum\n    Then we will come,\n  And ride the stang again.\n    With a ran tan tang,\n    And a ran tan tan tang,\" &c.\n\nThe conclusion of this local custom is generally ended at the market cross, (if any,) or in\nthe middle of the hamlet; after which, one of the posse goes round with a hat, begging the\ncontributions of those present; they then regale themselves at some of the village ale-shops,\nout of the proceeds of the day's merriment.--Brand and Strutt mention this custom; as does\nBrigg, in his \"Westmoreland as it was.\"\n\nJ.W.\n\n_Preston, Lancashire._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE SKETCH-BOOK.\n\n[The following characteristic sketch having been presented to me by a friend as, to the best\nof his knowledge, an unpublished _morceau_ by the celebrated Ettrick Shepherd, I have by his\npermission the pleasure of adding it, to the many interesting _cabinet pictures_, already preserved\nin this department of the MIRROR.--M.L.B.]\n\nROVER.\n\nRover is now about six years old. He was born half a year before our eldest girl; and is accordingly\nlooked upon as a kind of elder brother by the children.

You may make him your friend, but he scorns to be a pet. No one can\nsee him without admiring him, and no one can know him without loving him. He is as regularly\ninquired after as any other member of the family; for who that has ever known Rover can forget\nhim? He has an instinctive perception of his master's friends, to whom he metes out his caresses\nin the proportion of their attachment to the chief object of his affections. When I return\nfrom an absence, or when he meets an old friend of mine, or of his own (which is the same thing\nto him) his ecstacy is unbounded; he tears and curvets about the room as if mad; and if out\nof doors, he makes the welkin ring with his clear and joyous note. When he sees a young person\nin company he immediately selects him for a play fellow. He fetches a stick, coaxes him out\nof the house, drops it at his feet; then retiring backwards, barking, plainly indicates his\ndesire to have it thrown for him. He is never tired of his work. Indeed, I fear poor fellow,\nthat his teeth, which already show signs of premature decay, have suffered from the diversion.\nBut though Rover has a soul for fun, yet he is a game dog too. There is not a better cocker\nin England. In fact he delights in sport of every kind, and if he cannot have it with me, he\nwill have it on his own account. He frequently decoys the greyhounds out and finds hares for\nthem. Indeed he has done me some injury in this way, for if he can find a pointer loose, he\nwill, if possible, seduce him from his duty, and take him off upon some lawless excursion;\nand it is not till after an hour's whistling and hallooing that I see the truants sneaking\nround to the back door, panting and smoking, with their tails knitted up between their legs,\nand their long dripping tongues depending from their watery mouths--_he_ the most bare-faced\ncaitiff of the whole. In general, however, he will have nothing to say to the canine species,\nfor notwithstanding the classification of Buffon, he considers he has a prescriptive right\nto associate with man. He is, in fact, rather cross with other dogs; but with children he is\nquite at home, doubtless reckoning himself about on a level with them in the scale of rational\nbeings. Every boy in the village knows his name, and I often catch him in the street with a\nposse of little, dirty urchins playing around him. But he is not quite satisfied with this\nkind of company; for, if taking a walk with any of the family, he will only just acknowledge\nhis plebeian play-fellow with a simple shake of the tail, equivalent to the distant nod which\na patrician school-boy bestows on the town-boy school-fellow whom he chances to meet when in\ncompany with his aristocratical relations. The only approach to bad feeling that I ever discovered\nin Rover is a slight disposition to jealousy; but this in him is more a virtue than a vice;\nfor it springs entirely from affection, and has nothing mean or malicious in it, one instance\nwill suffice to show how he expresses this feeling."}

Specifically, I want to focus on the impact that the air children breathe has on their health and how this relates to our current topic. It's worth noting that if a child is discovered to have perished due to starvation in a basement or an attic, it generates an outcry of shock from the public. Similarly, in a recent incident in Lowell, when a few boys accidentally consumed some poisonous roots out of their insatiable curiosity and paid the price, it made headlines across the country.

{"ID": 168, "text": "Therefore, if a certain number of things exist in nature, there must be a cause for their existence, and it must be an external cause as it cannot be contained in the actual nature of the thing itself. This rule applies to everything that consists of several individuals. From this, it follows that there is only one substance of the same nature as existence must be deducible from its definition alone. The more reality or being a thing has, the greater the number of its attributes, and each attribute of the one substance must be conceived through itself as it constitutes its essence. It is important to note that even though two attributes may be conceived as distinct, it does not mean they constitute two entities or two different substances."}

Our situation might not be quite as solemn, but the doctor was\nquite as pressing; and seated on the corner of a bastion, while the guns\nwere roaring above our heads, I listened to an effusion in the most\nestablished style of sexagenarian poetry.\n\n  \"Rachel est sans d\u00e9sirs,\n    C'est un bouton de rose,\n    Que la nature arrose,\n  Et dispose \u00e0 s'ouvrir.\n\n  Dans son cour sans detour,\n    Il n'est pas jour encore;\n    Il attend pour eclore\n  Un rayon de l'amour!\"\n\nI listened without a laugh, and won the eternal gratitude of the writer.\nNothing could be clearer than that, whatever the effusion might owe to\nthe inspiration of Cupid, Apollo had no share in its charm. On my part,\nit would probably have been an act of the truest friendship, to have bid\nhim burn his tablets, forswear poetry for ever, and regard himself as\nforbidden the temptations of the maids of Parnassus. But I should have\nbroken his heart. I took the simpler but more effectual cure--I bade him\nfind out this idol, and marry her. Before I forget him and his sorrows,\nlet me mention, that he took my advice, and that, on my return to the\nContinent some years after, I found the poet transferred into the\nbenedict, with a pretty wife at his side, and a circle of lively\nchildren at his knee--an active, thriving, and rational member of the\ncommunity. I always quote the doctor, for the superiority of the\nsoothing system. The vinegar of criticism would have festered the wounds\nof his vanity; the art of (must I call it) flattery healed them. It left\na scar, I acknowledge; for the doctor still wrote verses, and still had\na lurking propensity for climbing the slippery slope of poetic renown.\nBut the realities of life are fortunate correctives to this passion,\nand, like Piron, luckily\n\n  \"Il ne fut rien\n  Pas m\u00eame academician.\"\n\nBut on this night our \"intercourse of souls\" was interrupted by one of\nthose painful evidences of the renewal of hostilities which shows war in\nits truest aspect. A long column of vehicles, which we had seen moving\nfor some time across the plain, and whose movement, by the torches of\nthe escort, looked from the ramparts like the trailing of an immense\nphosphoric serpent, approached the gates. The announcement was soon made\nthat it was a large detachment of prisoners and wounded, who had arrived\nfrom the desperate but decisive battle in Flanders. All the medical\nofficers of the garrison were immediately in requisition; and the sights\nwhich I saw, even when standing at the gate, as the carts and cars\nrolled over the drawbridge, were sufficient to startle feelings more\nused to such terrible demonstrations of the folly or the frenzy of the\nworld. But this was no time to indulge indolent sensibilities. Of\ncourse, I have no desire to enter into the startling details of that\nspectacle. But mastering myself so far, as to volunteer my attendance\nfor the time in the hospital, the thought often occurred to me, that\nthere could be no better lesson for the love of conquest than a walk\nthrough a military hospital after the first battle.\n\nThis anxious service lasted during the greater part of the night; for\nthe wounded amounted to little less than a thousand, both French and\nforeign. But as I was returning to my mattress, I recollected the\ncountenance of a prisoner standing at the door of one of the chambers\nset apart for officers of the higher rank. The man put his hand to his\nshako, and addressed me in German;--he was one of the squadron of Hulans\nwhom I had commanded in the Prussian retreat, and who had rejoined his\nregiment after the skirmish with the French dragoons. He expressed great\ndelight in finding that I was a survivor. But \"on whom was he now in\nattendance?\" \"On Major-General Count Varnhorst.\" He told me that the\ngeneral had volunteered to join the Austrian army in the Netherlands,\nand taking the Hulan with him, had been wounded in covering the retreat,\nbeen found on the field, and was now in the hands of the surgeons in\nthat chamber!\n\nI pass briefly over this scene. I found my brave friend apparently at\nthe point of death; he had been wounded by the sabre, trampled under\nhorses' hoofs, and crushed in every imaginable way, in the course of the\ndesperate defence which he made against an overwhelming force of the\nenemy's cavalry. The officers of the escort were loud in reports of his\nalmost frantic gallantry; but he was now so exhausted by the length of\nthe march as to be almost insensible: he knew no one; and his case,\nafter a day or two, was pronounced beyond all cure. It was then that I\nobtained permission to watch over him, and at least provide that he\nshould not be disturbed in his closing hours. Care is often more than\nscience, and care succeeded in this instance, against all the ominous\nlooks of the medical staff. I so much delighted Pantoufle, by having\nthus overthrown the authority of a pragmatical _confr\u00e8re_, who had been\npeculiarly stern in his prognostics; that he made the proposal to me of\njoining him in the chances of his profession. \"I shall fix myself in\nParis,\" said he; \"fame will be the inevitable consequence, and fortune\nwill follow; here you shall be my successor.\" I fought off the prospect\nas well as I could, and pleaded my want of professional knowledge. His\ncountenance, at the words, would have been an incomparable study of\nmingled burlesque and scorn. He instanced a whole crowd of leading men,\nwhom he unceremoniously designated as having made fortunes, not by\nknowledge, but simply by its absence. \"Their ignorance,\" said he, \"gives\nthem effrontery, and effrontery is the grand secret of fame. You are an\nEnglishman and a philosopher,\"--the latter expression uttered with a\ncurl of the lip and an elevation of the brow, which evidently translated\nthe word, a fool. \"You take things circuitously, while success lies in\nthe straight line; thus you fail, we triumph.\"\n\nI admitted the rapidity of his countrymen.\n\n\"In France,\" said he, or rather exclaimed, \"two things conduct to\nrenown; and but two--to stop at nothing, and never to admit ignorance in\nany thing; in medicine, to cure or kill without delay; in surgery, to\noperate at all risks. If the patient dies, there are fifty reasons for\nit; if the surgeon hesitates, the public will allow of but one. Politics\nare not within my line, and the subject is just now a delicate one; but\nyou see that the secret of renown is, to run on the edge of the\nscaffold. In soldiership the principle is the same--always to fight,\nwhenever you can find any body to fight with; you will deserve to be\nfamous, or deserve to be guillotined.'\n\n\"Perhaps both,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Nothing more probable. But still something is done; inaction does\nnothing. Look at Dumourier; he has had no more necessity for fighting\nthis battle, than for jumping from the parapet of Notre-Dame. But he has\nfought, he has conquered; and, instead of throwing himself from the\nparapet of Notre-Dame, which he probably would have done in the next\nfortnight's _ennui_ in Paris, all Paris is placarded with his\nbulletins.\"\n\n\"But he _might_ have been beaten; he might have been ruined, or brought\nto trial for rashness; or to an Austrian prison, like La Fayette.\"\n\n\"Of course he might. But the question is of the fact--let prophets deal\nwith the future. He _has_ beaten the Austrians; he _has_ conquered\nFlanders; he _has_ made himself the first man of France by the act, for\nwhich, if he had been an Austrian general, he would have been brought to\na court-martial, his victory pronounced contrary to rule, his bravery a\nbreach of etiquette, and the rest of his days, if he was not shot on the\nramparts of Vienna, spent in a dungeon in Prague. Take my advice; dash\nat every thing; risk is the grand talent--adventure, the philosopher's\nstone. So, listen to me; you shall be admitted to the Hotel Dieu as an\n_\u00e9l\u00e8ve_; become my assistant, and make your fortune.\"\n\nI stared at this sudden explosion of the doctor's rhetoric; but I should\nhave remembered, that he was under the double inspiration of new-born\nlove and reluctant rhyme.\n\nVarnhorst at length attempted to walk as far as the ramparts, and I was\nenjoying the pride of being able to exhibit my patient to the garrison;\nwhen, just as we were issuing from the long and chill corridors into the\nfresh air and sunshine, I observed the commandant coming towards me with\na peculiar air of gravity, attended by several of his officers. Bowing\nto Varnhorst with military etiquette, he took him aside and communicated\nto him a few words, which made his pale countenance look paler still.\n\"My friend is brave,\" was the Prussian's reply, turning a glance to\nwhere I stood. \"I have seen him in the field. I am satisfied that,\nwherever he is, he will do his duty.\"\n\nThe commandant now walked up to me, and with an air of embarrassment put\na sealed letter into my hands. It was from the minister of foreign\naffairs, and was marked _secret and immediate_. I opened it, and I shall\nnot say with what feelings I saw--an order for my attendance at the\noffice of the minister, signed ROBESPIERRE.\n\nIf the grim majesty of death had put his signature in person to this\norder, it would not have borne a more mortal aspect. It was a pang! yet\nthe pang did not continue long. Inevitable things are not the hardest to\nbe borne. At all events, there was no time for pondering on the subject.\nThe carriage which had brought the order and the government _huissier_,\nwas at the gate. Varnhorst gave me one grasp of his honest hand as I\nleft him; the commandant wished me \"good fortune.\" I hurried into the\ncarriage, and we flew on the road to Paris.\n\nOn reaching the barrier, we turned off to the quarter of the Luxembourg,\nand stopped at the gate of a moderate-sized house, where my conductor\nand I entered. I was shown into a small and simple room; where I found a\nman advanced in years, and of a striking aspect. He said not a word; I\nhad no inclination to speak. The one or two hesitating syllables which I\naddressed to him were answered only by a bow and a look, as if he did\nnot understand the language; and I awaited the approach of the terror of\nFrance, the horror of Europe, during half an hour, which seemed to me\ninterminable. The door at last opened, a valet came in, and the name of\n\"Robespierre\" thrilled through every fibre; but, instead of the frowning\ngiant to which my fancy had involuntarily attached the name, I saw a\nslight figure, highly dressed, and even with the air of a fop on the\nstage. Holding a perfumed handkerchief in one hand, which he waved\ntowards his face like one indulging in the fragrance, and a diamond\nsnuff-box in the other, he advanced with a sliding step; and after a\nsallow smile to me, and a solemn bow to the old man, congratulated\nhimself on the \"honour of the acquaintance, which he had been indebted\nto his friend Elnathan for making, in my person.\" I was all\nastonishment: I had come in expectation of receiving my death-warrant--I\nhad a reception like an ambassador. I now perplexed myself with the\nidea, that I had been mistaken for some stranger in the foreign\ndiplomacy; but I was instantly set right by his pronouncing my name, and\nmaking some allusions to \"the influence of my family in the British\nParliament.\"\n\nYet, I was still in the tiger's den, and I expected to feel the talons.\nI was happily disappointed; the claw was sheathed in velvet. A slight\nrefection was brought in by an embroidered domestic, and it was\nevidently the wish of this tremendous demagogue to appear the man of\nrefinement, at least in my instance.\n\n\"My friend Elnathan,\" said he, \"has informed me that you wish to return\nto England?\"\n\nThis was pronounced in the meekest tone of interrogatory; and, with eyes\nscarcely raised to either of us, he awaited my confirmation of his idea.\n\nIt was given unhesitatingly; and my glance at the countenance of the old\nman was answered by another, which told me that I saw the correspondent\nof my friend Mordecai.\n\n\"The circumstances are simply these,\" said the dictator in the same\ndelicate tone; \"the government has occasion to arrange some matters of\nimportance with the British cabinet. The successes of the Republic have\nraised jealousies, which it is for the advantage of human nature that we\nshould reconcile if possible. France and England are the only free\ncountries: their hostility can only be injurious to freedom.\"\n\nHe paused, and his cold grey eye, after traversing the floor, was slowly\nraised to me.\n\nI admitted my perfect agreement in the opinion, that \"wherever national\nconflict could be avoided, it was the business of all rational men to\nmaintain peace.\" I saw a grim smile pass over his sallow features,\nprobably at having found another dupe. Elnathan sat in profound silence,\nwithout a muscle moved.\n\nRobespierre, rising, took from a portfolio a letter, and put it into the\nJew's hand. He now had got over that strange embarrassment with which\nhis habitual nervousness had marked his first address, and spoke\nlargely, and with a considerable expression of authority.\n\n\"The English government,\" said he, \"have expressed some unnecessary\nuneasiness at the progress of opinion in Europe. The late victory, which\nhas decided the fate of the Austrian Netherlands, will probably increase\nthat uneasiness. Communications through the usual channels are slow,\nimperfect, and open to espionage on all sides. I have, therefore,\napplied to my friend Elnathan to point out some individual in whom he\nhas perfect confidence, and through whom the communication can be made.\nHe has named you.\"\n\nElnathan, with his huge hands clasped on his breast, and his bushy brows\ndrawn deep over his eyes, bent forward with almost oriental affirmation.\n\n\"When will you be ready to set out for Calais?\"\n\n\"This moment,\" was my willing answer.\n\n\"No, we are not quite prepared.\" He walked for a while about the room,\npondering on the subject; then, turning to Elnathan, he directed the Jew\nto get ready some papers connected with the financial dealings which his\nEnglish brethren were then beginning to carry on extensively throughout\nEurope. Those were to be arranged by next day, and for those I must\nwait.\n\n\"You shall be under the care of Elnathan,\" said the master of my fate.\n\"He will obtain your passports from the Foreign Office, and you will\nleave Paris to-morrow evening at furthest. We must avoid all suspicion,\nElnathan,\" said he, turning to the Jew. \"Paris is a hot-bed of spies.\nApropos, where do you propose to spend the evening?\"\n\nMy mind glanced at Vincennes, and his eye, cold as it was, caught my\nstartled conception.\n\n\"No, your return to-night to the fortress would only set all the tongues\nof Paris in motion to-morrow. You must be seen in public to-night, at\nthe opera, the theatre, or where you will. You must figure as an\nEnglishman travelling at his pleasure and his leisure--_a Milor_.\"\n\n\"Madame Roland gives a soiree to-night,\" humbly interposed the Jew.\n\n\"Ha!--that is the best of all. You must go there. You will be seen by\nall the world. Elnathan will introduce you to the 'philosophic lady' of\nthe circle.\" He then resumed his pacing round the room. I could observe\nthe vulpine expression of his visage, the twitching of his hands, the\nkeen sidelong look of a man living in perpetual alarm. We prepared to\ntake our leave; but he now suddenly resumed the _petit-ma\u00eetre_,\nflourished his perfumed handkerchief again, gave a passing smile at the\nmirror, and offered me the honours of his snuff-box with the affectation\nof the stage. But, as we reached the door of the apartment, he made a\nlong, single stride, which brought him up close to me. \"Remember, sir,\"\nsaid he, in a stern voice, wholly unlike the past--\"You have it in\ncharge from me to inform the government of your country of the actual\nfeeling of France. It is true that there are madmen among\nus--Brissotins, Girondists, and other enthusiasts--who talk of war. I\ntell you that they _are_ madmen, and that _I_ will have no war.--There\nmay be conspirators, who think to shake the existing _r\u00e9gime_ of the\nrepublic, and look to war as the means of raising themselves on its\nruins.--_I_ tell you, and you may tell your cabinet, that they will not\naccomplish their objects here; and that, if they accomplish them, it\nwill be the fault and the folly alone of England. Impress those truths\non the minds of your countrymen: the Republic desires no war; her\nprinciple is peace, her purpose is peace, her prosperity is peace. There\nwill be, there shall be, there _can_ be, no war.\" He folded his arms,\nand stood like a pillar till we withdrew.\n\nI happened to ascertain shortly afterwards, that on this very day\nRobespierre had presided at a council which has sent off orders to\nDumourier to open the Scheldt, the notorious and direct preliminary to\nwar with England. Such is the sincerity of diplomacy!\n\nI remained during the rest of the day with Elnathan. His hotel was\nsplendid, and all that surrounded him gave the impression of great\nopulence; but it was obvious that he lived like a man in a gunpowder\nmagazine. He had several sons and daughters, whom, in the terrors of the\ntime, he had contrived to send among his connexions in Germany; and he\nnow lived alone, his wife having been dead for some years. All his\nwealth could not console him for the anxiety of his position; and\ndoubtless he would have perished long before, in the general massacre of\nthe opulent, except for the circumstance of being the chief channel of\nmoneyed communication between the government and Germany. In the course\nof our lonely but most _recherch\u00e9_ dinner, he explained to me slightly\nthe means of my recent preservation. The police-officer had acquainted\nhim with my being the bearer of a letter from Mordecai. The intelligence\nreached him just in time to save me, by a daring claim of my person as\nan agent of the English ministry. He had then lost sight of me, and\nbegan to think that I had perished; when the application of my friend\nthe doctor told him where I was to be found. The message of the head of\nthe Republic, requiring a confidential bearer of documents, struck him\nas affording an opportunity of my liberation; and though the palpable\nabsurdity of my worthy friend Pantoufle prevented any communication with\n_him_, no time was lost in proposing my name to authority.\n\n\"And now,\" said my entertainer, after drinking my safe arrival in a\nbumper of imperial tokay, \"En avance, for Madame Roland.\"\n\nWe drove to a splendid mansion in the Rue de la Revolution. The street\nin front was crowded with equipages, and it was with some difficulty\nthat we could make our way through the long and stately suite of rooms.\nThe house had belonged to the Austrian ambassador; and on the\ndeclaration of war it had been taken possession of by the Republic\nwithout ceremony.\n\nI observed to Elnathan, that \"to judge from the pomp of the furniture,\nrepublicanism was not republican every where.\"\n\n\"Nowhere but in the streets, or the prisons,\" was his reply in a\nwhisper. \"Since the Austrian left it, the whole hotel has been furnished\nanew at the most profuse expense, which I had the honour of supplying.\nRoland is a great personage, an honest nobody, a mill-horse at the wheel\nof office. He is probably drudging over his desk at this moment; but\nMadame is of another mould. \"La voil\u00e0!\" He turned suddenly, and made a\nprofound bow to a very showy female, who had advanced from a group for\nthe purpose of receiving the Jew and the stranger. I had now, for the\nfirst time, the honour of seeing this remarkable personage. Her figure\nwas certainly striking, and her physiognomy conveyed a great deal of\nher character for intelligence and decision. She had evidently dressed\nherself on the model of the _classique_; and though not handsome enough\nfor a Venus, nor light enough for a nymph, she might have made a\ntolerable Minerva. She had probably some thoughts of the kind; for\nbefore we had time to make our bows, she threw herself into an attitude\nof the Galerie des Antiques, and, with her eyes fixed profoundly on the\nground, awaited our incense.

{"ID": 1078, "text": "\nWhile this system of gradual emancipation would greatly promote the\nmaterial interests of Maryland, and of all the border States, the\nPresident does not overstate its influence in crushing the rebellion and\nrestoring peace.\n\nMaryland, the border States, and the South would then indeed commence a\nnew career of progress, by removing slavery and negroism; and their\naugmented wealth, and that of the whole country, would soon return to\nthe Government, in increased revenue, a sum far exceeding the cost of\ngradual emancipation and colonization. Indeed, if, as a mere financial\nquestion, I was devising the most effective plan for liquidating the\nnational debt and reducing our taxes, it would be thus vastly to augment\nour wealth and population by adopting this system.\n\nThe census of 1860 exhibits our increase of population from 1790 to 1860\nat 35.59 per cent., and of our wealth 126.45. Now, if we would increase\nthe wealth of the country only one tenth in the next ten years, by the\ngradual disappearance of slavery and negroism (far below the results of\nthe census), then, our wealth being now $16,159,616,068, the effect of\nsuch increase would be to make our wealth in 1870, instead of\n$36,593,450,585, more than sixteen hundred millions greater, being more\nthan three times our present debt, and in 1880, instead of\n$82,865,868,849, over three billions six hundred millions more, or more\nthan seven times our present debt.\n\nBefore the close of this letter, it will be shown that the difference,\n_per capita_, of the annual products of Massachusetts and Maryland\nexceeds $120. As to the other Southern States, the excess is much\ngreater. Now, if the annual products of the South were increased $120\neach _per capita_ (still far below Massachusetts) by the exclusion of\nslavery, then multiplying the total population of the South, 12,229,727,\nby 120, the result would be an addition to the annual value of the\nproducts of the South of $1,467,567,240, and in the decade,\n$14,675,672,400; the first amount being three times our debt on the 1st\nJuly, 1862, and the last sum thirty times our debt on that day. This\nchange would not be immediate, but there can be no doubt that, with the\nvastly greater natural advantages of the South, the superiority of free\nto slave labor, the immense immigration, especially from Europe to the\nSouth, aided by the Homestead bill, and the conversion of large\nplantations into small farms, an addition of at least one billion of\ndollars would be made, by the exclusion of slavery, to the value of the\nproducts of the South, in the ten years from 1870 to 1880, which sum is\nmore than double our public debt on the 1st July last."}

{"ID": 1204, "text": "Always, with\nhim, is the feeling that he is in the world to do all the good he can\npossibly do; not a moment, not an opportunity, must be lost.\n\nThe moment he rises and steps to the front of his pulpit he has the\nattention of every one in the building, and this attention he closely\nholds till he is through. Yet it is never by a striking effort that\nattention is gained, except in so far that his utter simplicity is\nstriking. \"I want to preach so simply that you will not think it\npreaching, but just that you are listening to a friend,\" I remember his\nsaying, one Sunday morning, as he began his sermon; and then he went on\njust as simply as such homely, kindly, friendly words promised. And how\neffectively!\n\nHe believes that everything should be so put as to be understood by all,\nand this belief he applies not only to his preaching, but to the reading\nof the Bible, whose descriptions he not only visualizes to himself, but\nmakes vividly clear to his hearers; and this often makes for fascination\nin result.\n\nFor example, he is reading the tenth chapter of I Samuel, and begins,\n\"'Thou shalt meet a company of prophets.'\"\n\n\"'Singers,' it should be translated,\" he puts in, lifting his eyes from\nthe page and looking out over his people. Then he goes on, taking this\nchange as a matter of course, \"'Thou shalt meet a company of singers\ncoming down from the high place--'\"\n\nWhereupon he again interrupts himself, and in an irresistible\nexplanatory aside, which instantly raises the desired picture in the\nmind of every one, he says: \"That means, from the little old church\non the hill, you know.\" And how plain and clear and real and\ninteresting--most of all, interesting--it is from this moment! Another\nman would have left it that prophets were coming down from a high place,\nwhich would not have seemed at all alive or natural, and here, suddenly,\nConwell has flashed his picture of the singers coming down from the\nlittle old church on the hill! There is magic in doing that sort of\nthing.\n\nAnd he goes on, now reading: \"'Thou shalt meet a company of singers\ncoming down from the little old church on the hill, with a psaltery, and\na tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, and they shall sing.'\"\n\nMusic is one of Conwell's strongest aids. He sings himself; sings as if\nhe likes to sing, and often finds himself leading the singing--usually\nso, indeed, at the prayer-meetings, and often, in effect, at the church\nservices.\n\nI remember at one church service that the choir-leader was standing\nin front of the massed choir ostensibly leading the singing, but that\nConwell himself, standing at the rear of the pulpit platform, with his\neyes on his hymn-book, silently swaying a little with the music and\nunconsciously beating time as he swayed, was just as unconsciously the\nreal leader, for it was he whom the congregation were watching and with\nhim that they were keeping time! He never suspected it; he was merely\nthinking along with the music; and there was such a look of contagious\nhappiness on his face as made every one in the building similarly happy.\nFor he possesses a mysterious faculty of imbuing others with his own\nhappiness.\n\nNot only singers, but the modern equivalent of psaltery and tabret and\ncymbals, all have their place in Dr. Conwell's scheme of church service;\nfor there may be a piano, and there may even be a trombone, and there is\na great organ to help the voices, and at times there are chiming bells.\nHis musical taste seems to tend toward the thunderous--or perhaps it\nis only that he knows there are times when people like to hear the\nthunderous and are moved by it.\n\nAnd how the choir themselves like it! They occupy a great curving\nspace behind the pulpit, and put their hearts into song. And as the\ncongregation disperse and the choir filter down, sometimes they are\nstill singing and some of them continue to sing as they go slowly out\ntoward the doors. They are happy--Conwell himself is happy--all the\ncongregation are happy. He makes everybody feel happy in coming to\nchurch; he makes the church attractive just as Howells was so long ago\ntold that he did in Lexington.\n\nAnd there is something more than happiness; there is a sense of ease, of\ncomfort, of general joy, that is quite unmistakable. There is nothing of\nstiffness or constraint. And with it all there is full reverence. It\nis no wonder that he is accustomed to fill every seat of the great\nbuilding.\n\nHis gestures are usually very simple. Now and then, when he works up to\nemphasis, he strikes one fist in the palm of the other hand. When he is\nthrough you do not remember that he has made any gestures at all, but\nthe sound of his voice remains with you, and the look of his wonderful\neyes. And though he is past the threescore years and ten, he looks out\nover his people with eyes that still have the veritable look of youth.\n\nLike all great men, he not only does big things, but keeps in touch with\nmyriad details. When his assistant, announcing the funeral of an old\nmember, hesitates about the street and number and says that they can\nbe found in the telephone directory, Dr. Conwell's deep voice breaks\nquietly in with, \"Such a number [giving it], Dauphin Street\"--quietly,\nand in a low tone, yet every one in the church hears distinctly every\nsyllable of that low voice.\n\nHis fund of personal anecdote, or personal reminiscence, is constant and\nillustrative in his preaching, just as it is when he lectures, and\nthe reminiscences sweep through many years, and at times are really\nstartling in the vivid and homelike pictures they present of the famous\nfolk of the past that he knew.\n\nOne Sunday evening he made an almost casual reference to the time when\nhe first met Garfield, then a candidate for the Presidency. \"I asked\nMajor McKinley, whom I had met in Washington, and whose home was\nin northern Ohio, as was that of Mr. Garfield, to go with me to Mr.\nGarfield's home and introduce me. When we got there, a neighbor had to\nfind him. 'Jim! Jim!' he called. You see, Garfield was just plain Jim to\nhis old neighbors. It's hard to recognize a hero over your back fence!\"\nHe paused a moment for the appreciative ripple to subside, and went on:\n\n\"We three talked there together\"--what a rare talking that must have\nbeen-McKinley, Garfield, and Conwell--\"we talked together, and after a\nwhile we got to the subject of hymns, and those two great men both told\nme how deeply they loved the old hymn, 'The Old-Time Religion.' Garfield\nespecially loved it, so he told us, because the good old man who brought\nhim up as a boy and to whom he owed such gratitude, used to sing it at\nthe pasture bars outside of the boy's window every morning, and young\nJim knew, whenever he heard that old tune, that it meant it was time\nfor him to get up. He said that he had heard the best concerts and the\nfinest operas in the world, but had never heard anything he loved as he\nstill loved 'The Old-Time Religion.' I forget what reason there was\nfor McKinley's especially liking it, but he, as did Garfield, liked it\nimmensely.\"\n\nWhat followed was a striking example of Conwell's intentness on losing\nno chance to fix an impression on his hearers' minds, and at the same\ntime it was a really astonishing proof of his power to move and sway.\nFor a new expression came over his face, and he said, as if the idea had\nonly at that moment occurred to him--as it most probably had--\"I think\nit's in our hymnal!\" And in a moment he announced the number, and the\ngreat organ struck up, and every person in the great church every man,\nwoman, and child--joined in the swinging rhythm of verse after verse,\nas if they could never tire, of \"The Old-Time Religion.\" It is a simple\nmelody--barely more than a single line of almost monotone music:\n\n  _It was good enough for mother and it's good enough for me!\n  It was good on the fiery furnace and it's good enough for me!_\n\n\nThus it went on, with never-wearying iteration, and each time with the\nrefrain, more and more rhythmic and swaying:\n\n\n   _The old-time religion,\n   The old-time religion,\n   The old-time religion--\n   It's good enough for me!_\n\n\nThat it was good for the Hebrew children, that it was good for Paul and\nSilas, that it will help you when you're dying, that it will show the\nway to heaven--all these and still other lines were sung, with a sort\nof wailing softness, a curious monotone, a depth of earnestness. And the\nman who had worked this miracle of control by evoking out of the past\nhis memory of a meeting with two of the vanished great ones of the\nearth, stood before his people, leading them, singing with them, his\neyes aglow with an inward light. His magic had suddenly set them into\nthe spirit of the old camp-meeting days, the days of pioneering and\nhardship, when religion meant so much to everybody, and even those who\nknew nothing of such things felt them, even if but vaguely. Every heart\nwas moved and touched, and that old tune will sing in the memory of all\nwho thus heard it and sung it as long as they live.\n\n\nV. GIFT FOR INSPIRING OTHERS\n\nTHE constant earnestness of Conwell, his desire to let no chance slip by\nof helping a fellowman, puts often into his voice, when he preaches, a\nnote of eagerness, of anxiety. But when he prays, when he turns to God,\nhis manner undergoes a subtle and unconscious change. A load has slipped\noff his shoulders and has been assumed by a higher power. Into his\nbearing, dignified though it was, there comes an unconscious increase of\nthe dignity. Into his voice, firm as it was before, there comes a deeper\nnote of firmness. He is apt to fling his arms widespread as he prays,\nin a fine gesture that he never uses at other times, and he looks upward\nwith the dignity of a man who, talking to a higher being, is proud of\nbeing a friend and confidant. One does not need to be a Christian to\nappreciate the beauty and fineness of Conwell's prayers.\n\nHe is likely at any time to do the unexpected, and he is so great a\nman and has such control that whatever he does seems to everybody a\nperfectly natural thing. His sincerity is so evident, and whatever\nhe does is done so simply and naturally, that it is just a matter of\ncourse.\n\nI remember, during one church service, while the singing was going on,\nthat he suddenly rose from his chair and, kneeling beside it, on the\nopen pulpit, with his back to the congregation, remained in that posture\nfor several minutes. No one thought it strange. I was likely enough the\nonly one who noticed it. His people are used to his sincerities. And\nthis time it was merely that he had a few words to say quietly to God\nand turned aside for a few moments to say them.\n\nHis earnestness of belief in prayer makes him a firm believer in answers\nto prayer, and, in fact, to what may be termed the direct interposition\nof Providence. Doubtless the mystic strain inherited from his mother has\nalso much to do with this. He has a typically homely way of expressing\nit by one of his favorite maxims, one that he loves to repeat\nencouragingly to friends who are in difficulties themselves or who know\nof the difficulties that are his; and this heartening maxim is, \"Trust\nin God and do the next thing.\"\n\nAt one time in the early days of his church work in Philadelphia\na payment of a thousand dollars was absolutely needed to prevent a\nlaw-suit in regard to a debt for the church organ. In fact, it was worse\nthan a debt; it was a note signed by himself personally, that had become\ndue--he was always ready to assume personal liability for debts of his\nchurch--and failure to meet the note would mean a measure of disgrace as\nwell as marked church discouragement.\n\nHe had tried all the sources that seemed open to him, but in vain. He\ncould not openly appeal to the church members, in this case, for it\nwas in the early days of his pastorate, and his zeal for the organ,\nhis desire and determination to have it, as a necessary part of\nchurch equipment, had outrun the judgment of some of his best friends,\nincluding that of the deacon who had gone to Massachusetts for him. They\nhad urged a delay till other expenses were met, and he had acted against\ntheir advice.\n\nHe had tried such friends as he could, and he had tried prayer. But\nthere was no sign of aid, whether supernatural or natural.\n\nAnd then, literally on the very day on which the holder of the note was\nto begin proceedings against him, a check for precisely the needed one\nthousand dollars came to him, by mail, from a man in the West--a man who\nwas a total stranger to him. It turned out that the man's sister, who\nwas one of the Temple membership, had written to her brother of Dr.\nConwell's work. She knew nothing of any special need for money, knew\nnothing whatever of any note or of the demand for a thousand dollars;\nshe merely outlined to her brother what Dr. Conwell was accomplishing,\nand with such enthusiasm that the brother at once sent the opportune\ncheck.\n\nAt a later time the sum of ten thousand dollars was importunately\nneeded. It was due, payment had been promised. It was for some of the\nconstruction work of the Temple University buildings. The last day had\ncome, and Conwell and the very few who knew of the emergency were in the\ndepths of gloom. It was too large a sum to ask the church people to make\nup, for they were not rich and they had already been giving splendidly,\nof their slender means, for the church and then for the university.\nThere was no rich man to turn to; the men famous for enormous charitable\ngifts have never let themselves be interested in any of the work of\nRussell Conwell. It would be unkind and gratuitous to suggest that\nit has been because their names could not be personally attached, or\nbecause the work is of an unpretentious kind among unpretentious people;\nit need merely be said that neither they nor their agents have cared\nto aid, except that one of the very richest, whose name is the most\ndistinguished in the entire world as a giver, did once, in response to\na strong personal application, give thirty-five hundred dollars, this\nbeing the extent of the association of the wealthy with any of the\nvaried Conwell work.\n\nSo when it was absolutely necessary to have ten thousand dollars the\npossibilities of money had been exhausted, whether from congregation or\nindividuals.\n\nRussell Conwell, in spite of his superb optimism, is also a man of deep\ndepressions, and this is because of the very fire and fervor of his\nnature, for always in such a nature there is a balancing. He believes in\nsuccess; success must come!--success is in itself almost a religion with\nhim--success for himself and for all the world who will try for it!\nBut there are times when he is sad and doubtful over some particular\npossibility. And he intensely believes in prayer--faith can move\nmountains; but always he believes that it is better not to wait for\nthe mountains thus to be moved, but to go right out and get to work at\nmoving them. And once in a while there comes a time when the mountain\nlooms too threatening, even after the bravest efforts and the deepest\ntrust. Such a time had come--the ten-thousand-dollar debt was a looming\nmountain that he had tried in vain to move. He could still pray, and he\ndid, but it was one of the times when he could only think that something\nhad gone wrong.\n\nThe dean of the university, who has been closely in touch with all his\nwork for many years, told me of how, in a discouragement which was the\nmore notable through contrast with his usual unfailing courage, he left\nthe executive offices for his home, a couple of blocks away.\n\n\"He went away with everything looking dark before him. It was\nChristmas-time, but the very fact of its being Christmas only added to\nhis depression--Christmas was such an unnatural time for unhappiness!\nBut in a few minutes he came flying back, radiant, overjoyed, sparkling\nwith happiness, waving a slip of paper in his hand which was a check\nfor precisely ten thousand dollars! For he had just drawn it out of an\nenvelope handed to him, as he reached home, by the mail-carrier.\n\n\"And it had come so strangely and so naturally! For the check was from\na woman who was profoundly interested in his work, and who had sent the\ncheck knowing that in a general way it was needed, but without the least\nidea that there was any immediate need. That was eight or nine years\nago, but although the donor was told at the time that Dr. Conwell\nand all of us were most grateful for the gift, it was not until very\nrecently that she was told how opportune it was. And the change it made\nin Dr. Conwell! He is a great man for maxims, and all of us who are\nassociated with him know that one of his favorites is that 'It will all\ncome out right some time!' And of course we had a rare opportunity to\ntell him that he ought never to be discouraged. And it is so seldom that\nhe is!\"\n\nWhen the big new church was building the members of the church were\nvaguely disturbed by noticing, when the structure reached the second\nstory, that at that height, on the side toward the vacant and unbought\nland adjoining, there were several doors built that opened literally\ninto nothing but space!\n\nWhen asked about these doors and their purpose, Dr. Conwell would make\nsome casual reply, generally to the effect that they might be excellent\nas fire-escapes. To no one, for quite a while, did he broach even a\nhint of the great plan that was seething in his mind, which was that\nthe buildings of a university were some day to stand on that land\nimmediately adjoining the church!\n\nAt that time the university, the Temple University as it is now called,\nwas not even a college, although it was probably called a college.\nConwell had organized it, and it consisted of a number of classes and\nteachers, meeting in highly inadequate quarters in two little houses.\nBut the imagination of Conwell early pictured great new buildings\nwith accommodations for thousands! In time the dream was realized, the\nimagination became a fact, and now those second-floor doors actually\nopen from the Temple Church into the Temple University!\n\nYou see, he always thinks big! He dreams big dreams and wins big\nsuccess. All his life he has talked and preached success, and it is a\nreal and very practical belief with him that it is just as easy to do\na large thing as a small one, and, in fact, a little easier! And so he\nnaturally does not see why one should be satisfied with the small things\nof life. \"If your rooms are big the people will come and fill them,\" he\nlikes to say. The same effort that wins a small success would, rightly\ndirected, have won a great success. \"Think big things and then do them!\"\n\nMost favorite of all maxims with this man of maxims, is \"Let Patience\nhave her perfect work.\" Over and over he loves to say it, and his\nfriends laugh about his love for it, and he knows that they do and\nlaughs about it himself. \"I tire them all,\" he says, \"for they hear me\nsay it every day.\"\n\nBut he says it every day because it means so much to him. It stands,\nin his mind, as a constant warning against anger or impatience or\nover-haste--faults to which his impetuous temperament is prone, though\nfew have ever seen him either angry or impatient or hasty, so well does\nhe exercise self-control. Those who have long known him well have\nsaid to me that they have never heard him censure any one; that his\nforbearance and kindness are wonderful.\n\nHe is a sensitive man beneath his composure; he has suffered, and\nkeenly, when he has been unjustly attacked; he feels pain of that sort\nfor a long time, too, for even the passing of years does not entirely\ndeaden it.\n\n\"When I have been hurt, or when I have talked with annoying cranks, I\nhave tried to let Patience have her perfect work, for those very people,\nif you have patience with them, may afterward be of help.\"\n\nAnd he went on to talk a little of his early years in Philadelphia, and\nhe said, with sadness, that it had pained him to meet with opposition,\nand that it had even come from ministers of his own denomination, for he\nhad been so misunderstood and misjudged; but, he added, the momentary\nsomberness lifting, even his bitter enemies had been won over with\npatience.\n\nI could understand a good deal of what he meant, for one of the Baptist\nministers of Philadelphia had said to me, with some shame, that at first\nit used actually to be the case that when Dr. Conwell would enter one of\nthe regular ministers' meetings, all would hold aloof, not a single one\nstepping forward to meet or greet him.\n\n\"And it was all through our jealousy of his success,\" said the minister,\nvehemently. \"He came to this city a stranger, and he won instant\npopularity, and we couldn't stand it, and so we pounced upon things that\nhe did that were altogether unimportant. The rest of us were so jealous\nof his winning throngs that we couldn't see the good in him. And it\nhurt Dr. Conwell so much that for ten years he did not come to our\nconferences. But all this was changed long ago. Now no minister is so\nwelcomed as he is, and I don't believe that there ever has been a single\ntime since he started coming again that he hasn't been asked to say\nsomething to us. We got over our jealousy long ago and we all love him.\"\n\nNor is it only that the clergymen of his own denomination admire him,\nfor not long ago, such having been Dr. Conwell's triumph in the city of\nhis adoption, the rector of the most powerful and aristocratic church in\nPhiladelphia voluntarily paid lofty tribute to his aims and ability, his\nwork and his personal worth. \"He is an inspiration to his brothers in\nthe ministry of Jesus Christ,\" so this Episcopalian rector wrote. \"He is\na friend to all that is good, a foe to all that is evil, a strength to\nthe weak, a comforter to the sorrowing, a man of God. These words come\nfrom the heart of one who loves, honors, and reverences him for his\ncharacter and his deeds.\"\n\nDr. Conwell did some beautiful and unusual things in his church,\ninstituted some beautiful and unusual customs, and one can see\nhow narrow and hasty criticisms charged him, long ago, with\nsensationalism--charges long since forgotten except through the hurt\nstill felt by Dr. Conwell himself. \"They used to charge me with making a\ncircus of the church--as if it were possible for me to make a circus of\nthe church!\" And his tone was one of grieved amazement after all these\nyears.\n\nBut he was original and he was popular, and therefore there were\nmisunderstanding and jealousy. His Easter services, for example, years\nago, became widely talked of and eagerly anticipated because each sermon\nwould be wrought around some fine symbol; and he would hold in his hand,\nin the pulpit, the blue robin's egg, or the white dove, or the stem\nof lilies, or whatever he had chosen as the particular symbol for the\nparticular sermon, and that symbol would give him the central thought\nfor his discourse, accented as it would be by the actual symbol itself\nin view of the congregation. The cross lighted by electricity, to\nshine down over the baptismal pool, the little stream of water cascading\ngently down the steps of the pool during the baptismal rite, the roses\nfloating in the pool and his gift of one of them to each of the baptized\nas he or she left the water--all such things did seem, long ago, so\nunconventional. Yet his own people recognized the beauty and poetry of\nthem, and thousands of Bibles in Philadelphia have a baptismal rose from\nDr. Conwell pressed within the pages.\n\nHis constant individuality of mind, his constant freshness, alertness,\nbrilliancy, warmth, sympathy, endear him to his congregation, and when\nhe returns from an absence they bubble and effervesce over him as if he\nwere some brilliant new preacher just come to them. He is always new to\nthem. Were it not that he possesses some remarkable quality of charm he\nwould long ago have become, so to speak, an old story, but instead\nof that he is to them an always new story, an always entertaining and\ndelightful story, after all these years.\n\nIt is not only that they still throng to hear him either preach\nor lecture, though that itself would be noticeable, but it is the\ndelightful and delighted spirit with which they do it. Just the other\nevening I heard him lecture in his own church, just after his return\nfrom an absence, and every face beamed happily up at him to welcome him\nback, and every one listened as intently to his every word as if he\nhad never been heard there before; and when the lecture was over a huge\nbouquet of flowers was handed up to him, and some one embarrassedly said\na few words about its being because he was home again. It was all as\nif he had just returned from an absence of months--and he had been away\njust five and a half days!\n\n\nVI. MILLIONS OF HEARERS\n\nTHAT Conwell is not primarily a minister--that he is a minister because\nhe is a sincere Christian, but that he is first of all an Abou Ben\nAdhem, a man who loves his fellow-men, becomes more and more apparent as\nthe scope of his life-work is recognized. One almost comes to think\nthat his pastorate of a great church is even a minor matter beside\nthe combined importance of his educational work, his lecture work, his\nhospital work, his work in general as a helper to those who need help.\n\nFor my own part, I should say that he is like some of the old-time\nprophets, the strong ones who found a great deal to attend to in\naddition to matters of religion. The power, the ruggedness, the physical\nand mental strength, the positive grandeur of the man--all these are\nlike the general conceptions of the big Old Testament prophets. The\nsuggestion is given only because it has often recurred, and therefore\nwith the feeling that there is something more than fanciful in the\ncom-parison; and yet, after all, the comparison fails in one important\nparticular, for none of the prophets seems to have had a sense of humor!\n\nIt is perhaps better and more accurate to describe him as the last\nof the old school of American philosophers, the last of those\nsturdy-bodied, high-thinking, achieving men who, in the old days, did\ntheir best to set American humanity in the right path--such men as\nEmerson, Alcott, Gough, Wendell Phillips, Garrison, Bayard Taylor,\nBeecher; men whom Conwell knew and admired in the long ago, and all of\nwhom have long since passed away."}

PUNCH,\n\nWill you allow me, as one who knows Russia by heart, to express my intense admiration for the\nnew piece at the Shaftesbury Theatre, in which is given, in my opinion, the most faithful picture\nof the CZAR's dominions as yet exhibited to the British Public. ACT I. is devoted to \"a Street\nnear the Banks of the Neva, St. Petersburg,\" and here we have a splendid view of the Winter\nPalace, and what I took to be the Kremlin at Moscow. On one side is the house of a money-lender,\nand on the other the shelter afforded to a drosky-driver and his starving family. The author,\nwhose name must be BUCHANANOFF (though he modestly drops the ultimate syllable), gives as a\nsecond title to this portion of his wonderful work, \"The Dirge for the Dead.\" It is very appropriate.\nA student, whose funds are at the lowest ebb, commits a purposeless murder, and a \"pope\" who\nhas been on the look-out no doubt for years, seizes the opportunity to rush into the murdered\nman's dwelling, and sing over his inanimate body a little thing of his own composition. Anyone\nwho has been in Russia will immediately recognise this incident as absolutely true to life.\nAmongst my own acquaintance I know three priests who did precisely the same thing--they are\ncalled BROWNOFF, JONESKI, and ROBINSONOFF.\n\nNext we have the Palace of the _Princess Orenburg_, and make the acquaintance of _Anna Ivanovna_,\na young lady who is the sister of the aimless murderer, and owner of untold riches. We are\nalso introduced to the Head of Police, who, as everyone knows, is a cross between a suburban\ninspector, a low-class inquiry agent, and a _flaneur_ moving in the best Society. We find,\ntoo, naturally enough, an English _attach\u00e9_, whose chief aim is to insult an aged Russian General,\nwhose _sobriquet_ is, \"the Hero of Sebastopol.\" Then the aimless murderer reveals his crime,\nwhich, of course, escapes detection save at the hands of _Prince Zosimoff_, a nobleman, who\nI fancy, from his name, must have discovered a new kind of tooth-powder.\n\nNext we have the \"Interior of a Common Lodging House,\" the counterpart of which may be found\nin almost any street in the modern capital of Russia. There are the religious pictures, the\ncathedral immediately opposite, with its stained-glass windows and intermittent organ, and\nthe air of sanctity without which no Russian Common Lodging House is complete. Needless to\nsay that _Prince Tooth-powder_--I beg pardon--and _Anna_ listen while _Fedor Ivanovitch_ again\nconfesses his crime, this time to the daughter of the drosky-driver, for whom he has a sincere\nregard, and I may add, affection. Although with a well-timed scream his sister might interrupt\nthe awkward avowal, she prefers to listen to the bitter end. This reminds me of several cases\nrecorded in the _Newgatekoff Calendaroff_, a miscellany of Russian crimes.\n\nAfter this we come to the Gardens of the Palace Taurida, when _Fedor_ is at length arrested\nand carted off to Siberia, an excellent picture of which is given in the last Act. Those who\n_really_ know Russian Society-will not be surprised to find that the Chief of the Police (promoted\nto a new position and a fur-trimmed coat), and the principal characters of the drama have also\nfound their way to the Military Outpost on the borders of the dreaded region. I say dreaded,\nbut should have added, without cause. M. BUCHANANOFF shows us a very pleasant picture. The\nprisoners seem to have very little to do save to preserve the life of the Governor, and to\ntalk heroics about liberty and other kindred subjects. _Prince Zosimoff_ attempts, for the\nfourth or fifth time, to make _Anna_ his own--he calls the pursuit \"a caprice,\" and it is indeed\na strange one--and is, in the nick of time, arrested, by order of the CZAR. After this pleasing\nand natural little incident, everyone prepares to go back to St. Petersburg, with the solitary\nexception of the Prince, who is ordered off to the Mines. No doubt the Emperor of RUSSIA had\nused the tooth-powder, and, finding it distasteful to him, had taken speedy vengeance upon\nits presumed inventor.\n\nI have but one fault to find with the representation. The play is capital, the scenery excellent,\nand the acting beyond all praise. But I am not quite sure about the title. M. BUCHANANOFF calls\nhis play \"_The_ Sixth _Commandment_\"--he would have been, in my opinion, nearer the mark, had\nhe brought it into closer association with the Ninth!\n\nBelieve me, dear _Mr. Punch_,\n\nYours, respectfully,\n\nRUSS IN URBE.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIN OUR GARDEN.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Suppose, TOBY dear boy,\" said the Member for Sark, \"we start a garden, and work in it ourselves.\nTEMPLE did it, you know, when he was tired of affairs of State.\"\n\n\"Sir RICHARD?\" I asked, never remembering to have seen the Member for Evesham in the company\nof a rake.\n\n\"No; CHARLES THE SECOND's Minister, who went down to Sheen two centuries before the Orleanist\nPrinces, and grew roses. Of course I don't mean to be there much in the Session. The thing\nis to have something during Recess to gently engage the mind and fully occupy the body.\"\n\nThis conversation took place towards the end of last Session but one. By odd coincidence I\nhad met the Member for Sark as I was coming from OLD MORALITY's room, where I had been quietly\ndining with him, JACKSON and AKERS-DOUGLAS made up party of four. It was second week of August;\neverybody tired to death. OLD MORALITY asked me to look in and join them about eight o'clock.\nKnocked at door; no answer; curious scurrying going round; somebody running and jumping; heard\nOLD MORALITY's voice, in gleeful notes, \"Now then, DOUGLAS, tuck in your tuppenny! Here you\nare, JACKSON! keep the mill a goin'!\" Knocked again; no answer; opened door gently; beheld\nstrange sight. The Patronage Secretary was \"giving a back\" to the FIRST LORD of the TREASURY.\nOLD MORALITY, taking running jump, cleared it with surprising agility considering AKERS-DOUGLAS'S\ninches. Then he trotted on a few paces, folded his arms and bent his head; Financial Secretary\nto Treasury, clearing AKERS-DOUGLAS, took OLD MORALITY in his stride, and \"tucked in his tuppenny\"\nin turn.\n\nThought I had better retire. Seemed on the whole the proceedings demanded privacy; but OLD\nMORALITY, catching sight of me, called out, \"Come along, TOBY! Only our little game. Fall in,\nand take your turn.\"\n\nRather afraid of falling over, but didn't like to spoil sport; cleared OLD MORALITY capitally;\nscrambled over AKERS-DOUGLAS; but couldn't manage JACKSON.\n\n\"I can't get over him,\" I said, apologetically.\n\n\"No,\" said AKERS-DOUGLAS, \"he's a Yorkshireman.\"\n\n\"'Tis but a primitive pastime,\" observed OLD MORALITY, when, later, we sat down to dinner;\n\"but remarkably refreshing; a great stimulant for the appetite. Indeed,\" he added, as he transferred\na whole grouse to his plate, \"I do not know anything that more forcibly brings home to the\nmind the truth underlying the old Greek aphorism, that a bird on your plate is worth two in\nthe dish.\"\n\nI gathered in conversation that when business gets a little heavy, when time presses, and leisure\nfor exercise is curtailed, OLD MORALITY generally has ten minutes leap-frog before dinner.\n\n\"We used at first to play it in the corridor; an excellent place; apparently especially designed\nfor the purpose; but we were always liable to interruption, and by putting the chairs on the\ntable here we manage well enough. It's been the making of me, and I may add, has enabled my\nRight Hon. friends with increased vigour and ease to perform their duty to their QUEEN and\nCountry. The great thing, dear TOBY, is to judiciously commingle physical exercise with mental\nactivity. What says the great bard of Abydos? _Mens sana in corpore sano_, which being translated\nmeans, mens--or perhaps I should say, men--should incorporate bodily exercise with mental exercitation.\"\n\nOf course I did not disclose to the Member for Sark, what had taken place in the privity of\nOLD MORALITY's room. That is not my way. The secret is ever sacred with me, and shall be carried\nwith me to the silent tomb. But I was much impressed with the practical suggestions of my esteemed\nLeader, and allured by their evident effect upon his appetite.\n\n\"Men,\" continued the Member for Sark, moodily, \"do all kinds of things in the Recess to make\nup for the inroads on the constitution suffered during the Session. They go to La Bourboule\nlike the MARKISS and RAIKES; or they play Golf like Prince ARTHUR; or they pay visits to their\nMothers-in-law in the United States, like CHAMBERLAIN and LYON PLAYFAIR; or they go to Switzerland,\nIndia, Russia, Australia, and Sierra Leone. Now if we had a garden, which we dug, and weeded,\nand clipped, and pruned ourselves, never eating a potato the sapling of which we had not planted,\nwatered, and if necessary grafted, with our own hands, we should live happy, healthful lives\nfor at least a month or two, coming back to our work having renewed our youth like the rhinoceros.\"\n\n\"But you don't know anything about gardening, do you?\"\n\n\"That's just it. Anyone can keep a garden that has been brought up to the business. But look\nwhat chances there are before two statesmen of, I trust I may say without egotism, average\nintelligence, who take to gardening without, as you may say, knowing anything about it. Think\nof the charm of being able to call a spade a Hoe! without your companion, however contentious,\ncapping the exclamation. Then think of the long vista of possible surprises. You dig a trench,\nand I gently sprinkle seed in it--\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but supposing _I_ sprinkle the seed, and _you_ dig the trench?\"\n\n\"--The seed is carrot, let us suppose,\" the Member for Sark continued, disregarding my interruption,\nhis fine face aglow with honest enthusiasm."}
{"ID": 324, "text": ". .\"\n\n\"New one every day.\"\n\n\"What's the difficulty, Jack?\"\n\n\"Am I walking around with a sign on my back?\" testily.\n\n\"Of a kind, yes.\"\n\nCathewe spoke so solemnly that Fitzgerald looked round, and saw that\nwhich set his ears burning.  Immediately he lowered his gaze and sought\nthe water again.\n\n\"Have I been making an ass of myself, Arthur?\"\n\n\"No, Jack; but you are laying yourself open to some wonder.  For three\nor four days now, except for the forty-eight hours on land there,\nyou've been a sort of killjoy.  Even the admiral has remarked it.\"\n\n\"Tell him it's my liver,\" with a laugh not wholly free of\nembarrassment.  \"Suppose,\" he continued, in a low voice; \"suppose--\"\nBut he couldn't go on.\n\n\"Yes, suppose,\" said Cathewe, taking up the broken thread; \"suppose\nthere was a person who had a heap of money, or will have some day; and\nsuppose there's another person who has but little and may have less in\ndays to come.  Is that the supposition, Jack?  The presumption of an\nold friend, a right that ought never to be abrogated.\"  Cathewe laid a\nhand on his young friend's shoulder; there was a silent speech of\nknowledge and brotherhood in it such as Fitzgerald could not mistake.\n\n\"That's the supposition,\" he admitted generously.\n\n\"Well, money counts only when you buy horses and yachts and houses, it\nnever really matters in anything else.\"\n\n\"It is easy to say that.\"\n\n\"It is also easy to learn that it is true.\"\n\n\"Isn't there a good deal of buying these days where there should be\ngiving?\"\n\n\"Not among real people.  You have had enough experience with both types\nto be competent to distinguish the one from the other.  You have birth\nand brains and industry; you're a decent sort of chap besides,\"\ngenially.  \"Can money buy these things when grounded on self-respect as\nthey are in you?  Come along now; for the admiral sent me after you.\nIt's the steward's champagne cocktail; and you know how good they are.\nAnd remember, if you will put your head into the clouds, don't take\nyour feet off the deck.\"\n\nFitzgerald expanded under his tactful interpretation.  A long breath of\nrelief issued from his heart, and the rending doubt was dissipated: the\nvulture-shadow spread its dark pennons and wheeled down the west.  A\npriceless thing is that friend upon whom one may shift the part of a\nburden.  It seemed to be one of Cathewe's occupations in life to\nabsorb, in a kindly, unemotional manner, other people's troubles.  It\nis this type of man, too, who rarely shares his own.\n\nIt would be rather graceless to say that after drinking the cocktail\nFitzgerald resumed his aforetime rosal lenses.  He was naturally at\nheart an optimist, as are all men of action.  And so the admiral, who\nhad begun to look upon him with puzzled commiseration, came to the\nconclusion that the young man's liver had resumed its normal functions.\nAn old woman would have diagnosed the case as one of heart (as Mrs.\nColdfield secretly and readily and happily did); but an old fellow like\nthe admiral generally compromises on the liver.\n\nWhen one has journeyed for days on the unquiet sea, a touch of land\nunderfoot renews, Antaeus-wise, one's strength and mental activity; so\na festive spirit presided at the dinner table.  The admiral determined\nto vault the enforced repression of his secret.  Inasmuch as it must be\ntold, the present seemed a propitious moment.  He signed for the\nattendants to leave the salon, and then rapped on the table for\nsilence.  He obtained it easily enough.\n\n\"My friends,\" he began, \"where do you think this boat is really going?\"\n\n\"Marseilles,\" answered Coldfield.\n\n\"Where else?\" cried M. Ferraud, as if diversion from that course was\nsomething of an improbability.\n\n\"Corsica.  We can leave you at Marseilles, Mr. Ferraud, if you wish;\nbut I advise you to remain with us.  It will be something to tell in\nyour old age.\"\n\nCathewe glanced across to Fitzgerald, as if to ask: \"Do you know\nanything about this?\"  Fitzgerald, catching the sense of this mute\ninquiry, nodded affirmatively.\n\n\"Corsica is a beautiful place,\" said Hildegarde.  \"I spent a spring in\nAjaccio.\"\n\n\"Well, that is our port,\" confessed the admiral, laying his precious\ndocuments on the table.  \"The fact is, we are going to dig up a\ntreasure,\" with a flourish.\n\nLaughter and incredulous exclamations followed this statement.\n\n\"Pirates?\" cried Coldfield, with a good-natured jeer.  He had cruised\nwith the admiral before.  \"Where's the cutlass and jolly-roger?  Yo-ho!\nand a bottle o' rum!\"\n\n\"Yes.  And where's the other ship following at our heels, as they\nalways do in treasure hunts, the rival pirates who will cut our throats\nwhen we have dug up the treasure?\"--from Cathewe.\n\n\"Treasures!\" mumbled M. Ferraud from behind his pineapple.  Carefully\nhe avoided Fitzgerald's gaze, but he noted the expression on\nBreitmann's face.  It was not pleasant.\n\n\"Just a moment,\" the admiral requested patiently.  \"I know it smells\nfishy.  Laura, go ahead and read the documents to the unbelieving\ngiaours.  Mr. Fitzgerald knows and so does Mr. Breitmann.\"\n\n\"Tell us about it, Laura.  No joking, now,\" said Coldfield,\nsurrendering his incredulity with some hesitance.  \"And if the treasure\ninvolves no fighting or diplomatic tangle, count me in.  Think of it,\nJane,\" turning to his wife; \"two old church-goers like you and me,\na-going after a pirate's treasure!  Doesn't it make you laugh?\"\n\nLaura unfolded the story, and when she came to the end, the excitement\nwas hot and Babylonic.  Napoleon!  What a word!  A treasure put\ntogether to rescue him from St. Helena!  Gold, French gold, English\ngold, Spanish and Austrian gold, all mildewing in a rotting chest\nsomewhere back of Ajaccio!  It was unbelievable, fantastic as one of\nthose cinematograph pictures, running backward.\n\n\"But what are you going to do with it when you find it?\"\n\n\"Findings is keepings,\" quoted the admiral.  \"Perhaps divide it,\nperhaps turn it over to France, providing France agrees to use it for\ncharitable purposes.\"\n\n\"A fine plan, is it not, Mr. Breitmann?\" said M. Ferraud.\n\n\"Findings is keepings,\" repeated Breitmann, with a pale smile.\n\nThe eyes of Hildegarde von Mitter burned and burned.  Could she but\nread what lay behind that impassive face!  And he took it all with a\nsmile!  What would he do? what would he do now? kept recurring in her\nmind.  She knew the man, or at least she thought she did; and she was\naware that there existed in his soul dark caverns which she had never\ndared to explore.  Yes, what would he do now?  How would he put his\nhand upon this gold?  She trembled with apprehension.\n\nAnd later, when she found the courage to put the question boldly, he\nanswered with a laugh, so low and yet so wild with fury that she drew\naway from him in dumb terror.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nBREITMANN MAKES HIS FIRST BLUNDER\n\nThe secretary nerved himself and waited; and yet he knew what her reply\nwould be, even before she framed it, knew it with that indescribable\ncertainty which prescience occasionally grants in the space of a\nmoment.  Before he had spoken there had been hope to stand upon, for\nshe had always been gentle and kindly toward him, not a whit less than\nshe had been to the others.\n\n\"Mr. Breitmann, I am sorry.  I never dreamed of this;\" nor had she.\nShe had forgotten Europeans seldom understand the American girl as she\nis or believe that the natural buoyancy of spirit is as free from\npurpose or intent as the play of a child.  But in this moment she\nremembered her little and perfectly inconsequent attentions toward this\nman, and seeing them from his viewpoint she readily forgave him.\nAbroad, she was always on guard; but here, among her own compatriots\nwho accepted her as she was, she had excusably forgotten.  \"I am sorry\nif you have misunderstood me in any way.\"\n\n\"I could no more help loving you than that those stars should cease to\nshine to-night,\" his voice heavy with emotion.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" she could only repeat.  Men had spoken to her like this\nbefore, and always had the speech been new to her and always had a\ngreat and tender pity charged her heart.  And perhaps her pity for this\none was greater than any she had previously known; he seemed so lonely.\n\n\"Sorry, sorry!  Does that mean there is no hope?\"\n\n\"None, Mr. Breitmann, none.\"\n\n\"Is there another?\" his throat swelling.  But before she could answer:\n\"Pardon me; I did not mean that.  I have no right to ask such a\nquestion.\"\n\n\"And I should not have answered it to any but my father, Mr.\nBreitmann.\"  She extended her hand.  \"Let us forget that you have\nspoken.  I should like you for a friend.\"\n\nWithout a word he took the hand and kissed it.  He made no effort to\nhold it, and it slipped from his clasp easily.\n\n\"Goodnight.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"  And he never lost sight of her till she entered the\nsalon-cabin.  He saw a star fall out of nothing into nothing.  She was\nsorry!  The moment brewed a thousand wild suggestions.  To abduct her,\nto carry her away into the mountains, to cast his dream to the four\nwinds, to take her in spite of herself.  He laid his hand on the teak\nrailing, wondering at the sudden wracking pain, a pain which unlinked\ncoherent thought and left his mind stagnant and inert.  For the first\ntime he realized that his pain was a recurrence of former ones similar.\nWhy?  He did not know.  He only remembered that he had had the pain at\nthe back of his head and that it was generally followed by a burning\nfury, a rage to rend and destroy things.  What was the matter?\n\nThe damp rail was cool and refreshing, and after a spell the pain\ndiminished.  He shook himself free and stood straight, his jaws hard\nand his eyes, absorbing what light there was from the stars, chatoyant.\nSorry!  So be it.  To have humbled himself before this American girl\nand to be snubbed for his pains!  But, patience!  Two million francs\nand his friends awaiting the word from him.  She was sorry!  He\nlaughed, and the laughter was not unlike that which a few nights gone\nhad startled the ears of the other woman to whom he had once appealed\nin passionate tones and not without success.\n\n\"Karl!\"\n\nThe sight of Hildegarde at this moment neither angered nor pleased him.\nHe permitted her hand to lay upon his arm.\n\n\"My head aches,\" he said, as if replying to the unspoken question in\nher eyes.\n\n\"Karl, why not give it up?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"Give it up?  What! when I have come this far, when I have gone through\nwhat I have?  Oh, no!  Do not think so little of me as that.\"\n\n\"But it is a dream!\"\n\nHe shook off her hand angrily.  \"If there is to be any reckoning I\nshall pay, never fear.  But it will not, _shall_ not fail!\"\n\nShe would have liked to weep for him.  \"I would gladly give you my\neyes, Karl, if you might see it all as I see it.  Ruin, ruin!  Can you\ntouch this money without violence?  Ah, my God, what has blinded you to\nthe real issues?\"\n\n\"I have not asked you to share the difficulties.\"\n\n\"No.  You have not been that kind to me.\"\n\nTo-night there were no places in his armor for any sentiment but his\nown.  \"I want nothing but revenge.\"\n\n\"I think I can read,\" her own bitterness getting the better of her\ntongue.  \"Miss Killigrew has declined.\"\n\n\"You have been listening?\" with a snarl.\n\n\"It has not been necessary to listen; I needed only to watch.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it to you?\"\n\n\"Take care, Karl!  You can not talk to me like that.\"\n\n\"Don't drive me, then.  Oh,\" with a sudden turn of mind, \"I am sorry\nthat you can not understand.\"\n\n\"If I hadn't I should never have given you my promise not to speak.\nThere was a time when you had right on your side, but that time ceased\nto be when you lied to me.  How little you understood me!  Had you\nspoken frankly and generously at the start, God knows I shouldn't have\nrefused you.  But you set out to walk over my heart to get that\nmiserable slip of paper.  Ah! had I but known!  I say to you, you will\nfail utterly and miserably.  You are either blind or mad!\"\n\nWithout a word in reply to this prophecy he turned and left her; and as\nsoon as he had vanished she kissed the spot on the rail where his hand\nhad rested and laid her own there.  When at last she raised it, the\nrail was no longer merely damp, it was wet.\n\n\n\"Now there,\" began Fitzgerald, taking M. Ferraud firmly by the sleeve,\n\"I have come to the end of my patience.  What has Breitmann to do with\nall this business?\"\n\n\"Will you permit me to polish my spectacles?\" mildly asked M. Ferraud.\n\n\"It's the deuce of a job to get you into a corner,\" Fitzgerald\ndeclared.  \"But I have your promise, and you should recollect that I\nknow things which might interest Mr. Breitmann.\"\n\n\"_Croyez-vous qu'il pleuve?  Il fait bien du vent_,\" adjusting his\nspectacles and viewing the clear sky and the serene bosom of the\nMediterranean.  Then M. Ferraud turned round with: \"Ah, Mr. Fitzgerald,\nthis man Breitmann is what you call 'poor devil,' is it not?  At dinner\nto-night I shall tell a story, at once marvelous past belief and\npathetic.  I shall tell this story against my best convictions because\nI wish him no harm, because I should like to save him from black ruin.\nBut, attend me; my efforts shall be as wind blowing upon stone; and I\nshall not save him.  An alienist would tell you better than I can.\nListen.  You have watched him, have you not?  To you he seems like any\nother man?  Yes?  Keen-witted, gifted, a bit of a musician, a good deal\nof a scholar?  Well, had I found that paper first, there would have\nbeen no treasure hunt.  I should have torn it into one thousand pieces;\nI should have saved him in spite of himself and have done my duty also.\nHe is mad, mad as a whirlwind, as a tempest, as a fire, as a sandstorm.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"To-night, to-night!\"\n\nAnd the wiry little man released himself and bustled away to his chair\nwhere he became buried in rugs and magazines.\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nAN OLD SCANDAL\n\n\"Corsica to-morrow,\" said the admiral.\n\n\"Napoleon,\" said Laura.\n\n\"Romance,\" said Cathewe.\n\n\"Treasures,\" said M. Ferraud.\n\nHildegarde felt uneasy.  Breitmann toyed with the bread crumbs.  He was\ninattentive besides.\n\n\"Napoleon.  There is an old scandal,\" mused M. Ferraud.  \"I don't think\nthat any of you have heard it.\"\n\n\"That will interest me,\" Fitzgerald cried.  \"Tell it.\"\n\nM. Ferraud cleared his throat with a sharp ahem and proceeded to\nburnish his crystals.  Specks and motes were ever adhering to them.  He\nheld them up to the light and pretended to look through them: he saw\nnothing but the secretary's abstraction.\n\n\"We were talking about treasures the other night,\" began the Frenchman,\n\"and I came near telling it then.  It is a story of Napoleon.\"\n\n\"Never a better moment to tell it,\" said the admiral, rubbing his hands\nin pleasurable anticipation.\n\n\"I say to you at once that the tale is known to few, and has never had\nany publicity, and must never have any.  Remember that, if you please,\nMr. Fitzgerald, and you also, Mr. Breitmann.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Breitmann.  \"I was not listening.\"\n\nM. Ferraud repeated his request clearly.\n\n\"I am no longer a newspaper writer,\" Breitmann affirmed, clearing the\nfog out of his head.  \"A story about Napoleon; will it be true?\"\n\n\"Every word of it.\"  M. Ferraud folded his arms and sat back.\n\nDuring the pause Hildegarde shivered.  Something made her desire madly\nto thrust a hand out and cover M. Ferraud's mouth.\n\n\"We have all read much about Napoleon.  I can not recall how many lives\nrange shoulder to shoulder on the booksellers' shelves.  There have\nbeen letters and memoirs, anecdotes by celebrated men and women who\nwere his contemporaries.  But there is one thing upon which we shall\nall agree, and that is that the emperor was in private life something\nof a beast.  As a soldier he was the peer of all the Caesars; as a\nhusband he was vastly inferior to any of them.  This story does not\nconcern him as emperor.  If in my narrative there occurs anything\noffensive, correct me instantly.  I speak English fluently, but there\nare still some idioms I trip on.\"\n\n\"I'll trust you to steer straight enough,\" said the admiral.\n\n\"Thank you.  Well, then, once upon a time Napoleon was in Bavaria.  The\ncountry was at that time his ablest ally.  There was a pretty peasant\ngirl.\"\n\nA knife clattered to the floor.  \"Pardon!\" whispered Hildegarde to\nCathewe.  \"I am clumsy.\"  She was as white as the linen.\n\nBreitmann went on with his crumbs.\n\n\"I believe,\" continued M. Ferraud, \"that it was in the year 1813 that\nthe emperor received a peculiar letter.  It begged that a title be\nconferred upon a pretty little peasant boy.  The emperor was a grim\nhumorist, I may say in passing; and for this infant he created a\nbaronetcy, threw in a parcel of land, and a purse.  That was the end of\nit, as far as it related to the emperor.  Waterloo came and with it\nvanished the empire; and it would be a long time before a baron of the\nempire returned to any degree of popularity.  For years the matter was\nforgotten.  The documents in the case, the letters of patent, the deeds\nand titles to the land, and a single Napoleonic scrawl, these gathered\ndust in the loft.  When I heard this tale the thing which appealed to\nme most keenly was the thought that over in Bavaria there exists the\nonly real direct strain of Napoleonic blood: a Teuton, one of those who\nhad brought about the downfall of the empire.\"\n\n\"You say exists?\" interjected Cathewe.\n\n\"Exists,\" laconically.\n\n\"You have proofs?\" demanded Fitzgerald.\n\n\"The very best in the world.  I have not only seen those patents, but I\nhave seen the man.\"\n\n\"Very interesting,\" agreed Breitmann, brushing the crumbs into his hand\nand dropping them on his plate.  \"But, go on.\"\n\n\"What a man!\" breathed Fitzgerald, who began to see the drift of things.\n\n\"I proceed, then.  Two generations passed.  I doubt if the third\ngeneration of this family has ever heard of the affair.  One day the\nlast of his race, in clearing up the salable things in his house--for\nhe had decided to lease it--stumbled on the scant history of his\nforebears.  He was at school then; a promising youngster, brave,\ncheerful, full of adventure and curiosity.  Contrary to the natural\nsequence of events, he chose the navy, where he did very well.  But in\nsome way Germany found out what France already knew.  Here was a fine\nchance for a stroke of politics.  France had always watched; without\nfear, however, but with half-formed wonder.  Germany considered the\ncase: why not turn this young fellow loose on France, to worry and to\nharry her?  So, quietly Germany bore on the youth in that cold-blooded,\nTeutonic way she has, and forced him out of the navy.\n\n\"He was poor, and poverty among German officers, in either branch, is a\nbad thing.  Our young friend did not penetrate the cause of this at\nfirst; for he had no intention of utilizing his papers, save to dream\nover them.  The blood of his great forebear refused to let him bow\nunder this unjust stroke.  He sought a craft, an interesting one.  The\nnet again closed in on him.  He began to grow desperate, and\ndesperation was what Germany desired.  Desperation would make a tool of\nthe young fellow.  But our young Napoleon was not without wit.  He\nplotted, but so cleverly and secretly that never a hand could reach out\nto stay him.  Germany finally offered him an immense bribe.  He threw\nit back, for now he hated Germany more than he hated France.  You\nwonder why he hated France?  If France had not discarded her empire--I\ndo not refer to the second empire--he would have been a great personage\nto-day.  At least this must be one of his ideas.\n\n\"And there you are,\" abruptly.  \"Here we have a Napoleon, indeed with\nall the patience of his great forebear.  If Germany had left him alone\nhe would to-day have been a good citizen, who would never have\npermitted futile dreams to enter his head, and who would have\ncontemplated his greatness with the smile of a philosopher.  And who\ncan say where this will end?  It is pitiful.\"\n\n\"Pitiful?\" repeated Breitmann.  \"Why that?\" calmly.\n\nM. Ferraud repressed the admiration in his eyes.  It was a singular\nduel.  \"When we see a madman rushing blindly over a precipice it is a\nhuman instinct to reach out a hand to save him.\"\n\n\"But how do you know he is rushing blindly?\"  Breitmann smiled this\nquestion.\n\nHildegarde sent him a terrified glance.  But for the stiff back of her\nchair she must have fallen.\n\nM. Ferraud demolished an olive before he answered the question.  \"He\nhas allied himself with some of the noblest houses in France; that is\nto say, with the most heartless spendthrifts in Europe.  Napoleon IV?\nThey are laughing behind his back this very minute.  They are making a\ncat's-paw of his really magnificent fight for their own ignoble ends,\nthe Orleanist party.  To wreak petty vengeance on France, for which\nnone of them has any love; to embroil the government and the army that\nthey may tell of it in the boudoirs.  This is the aim they have in\nview.  What is it to them that they break a strong man's heart?  What\nis it to them if he be given over to perpetual imprisonment?  Did a\nBourbon ever love France as a country?  Has not France always\nrepresented to them a purse into which they might thrust their\ndishonest hands to pay for their base pleasures?  Oh, beware of the\nconspirator whose sole portion in life is that of pleasure!  I wish\nthat I could see this young man and tell him all I know.  If I could\nonly warn him.\"\n\nBreitmann brushed his sleeve.  \"I am really disappointed in your\nclimax, Mr. Ferraud.\"\n\n\"I said nothing about a climax,\" returned M. Ferraud.  \"That has yet to\nbe enacted.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"A descendant of Napoleon, direct!  Poor devil!\"  The admiral was\nthunderstruck.  \"Why, the very spirit of Napoleon is dead.  Nothing\ncould ever revive it.  It would not live even a hundred days.\"\n\n\"Less than that many hours,\" said M. Ferraud.  \"He will be arrested the\nmoment he touches a French port.\"\n\n\"Father,\" cried Laura, with a burst of generosity which not only warmed\nher heart but her cheeks, \"why not find this poor, deluded young man\nand give him the treasure?\"\n\n\"What, and ruin him morally as well as politically?  No, Laura; with\nmoney he might become a menace.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" put in M. Ferraud; \"with money he might be made to\nput away his mad dream.  But I'm afraid that my story has made you all\ngloomy.\"\n\n\"It has made me sad,\" Laura admitted.  \"Think of the struggle, the\nself-denial, and never a soul to tell him he is mad.\"\n\nThe scars faded a little, but Breitmann's eyes never wavered.\n\n\"The man hasn't a ghost of a chance.\"  To Fitzgerald it was now no\npuzzle why Breitmann's resemblance to some one else had haunted him.\nHe was rather bewildered, for he had not expected so large an order\nupon M. Ferraud's promise.  \"Fifty years ago. . .\"\n\n\"Ah!  Fifty years ago,\" interrupted M. Ferraud eagerly, \"I should have\nthrown my little to the cause.  Men and times were different then; the\nworld was less sordid and more romantic.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall always hold that we have no right to that treasure.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks, Laura!  This is no time for sentiment.  The questions\nbuzzing in my head are: Does this man know of the treasure's existence?\nMight he not already have put his hand upon it?\"\n\n\"Your own papers discredit that supposition,\" replied Cathewe.  \"A\nstunning yarn, and rather hard to believe in these skeptical times.\nWhat is it?\" he asked softly, noting the dead white on Hildegarde's\ncheeks.\n\n\"Perhaps it is the smoke,\" she answered with a brave attempt at a smile.\n\nThe admiral in his excitement had lighted a heavy cigar and was\nconsuming it with jerky puffs, a bit of thoughtlessness rather\npardonable under the stress of the moment.  For he was beginning to\nentertain doubts.  It was not impossible for this Napoleonic chap to\nhave a chart, to know of the treasure's existence.  He wished he had\nheard this story before.  He would have left the women at home.\nCorsica was not wholly civilized, and who could tell what might happen\nthere?  Yes, the admiral had his doubts.\n\n\"I should like to know the end of the story,\" said Breitmann musingly.\n\n\"There is time,\" replied M. Ferraud; and of them all, only Fitzgerald\ncaught the sinister undercurrent.\n\n\"So, Miss Killigrew, you believe that this treasure should be handed\nover to its legal owner?\"  Breitmann looked into her eyes for the first\ntime that evening.\n\n\"I have some doubt about the legal ownership, but the sentimental and\nmoral ownership is his.  A romance should always have a pleasant\nending.\"\n\n\"You are thinking of books,\" was Cathewe's comment.  \"In life there is\nmore adventure than romance, and there is seldom anything more\nincomplete in every-day life than romance.\"\n\n\"That would be my own exposition, Mr. Cathewe,\" said Breitmann.\n\nThe two fenced briefly.  They understood each other tolerably well;\nonly, Cathewe as yet did not know the manner of the man with whom he\nwas matched.\n\nThe dinner came to an end, or, rather, the diners rose, the dinner\nhaving this hour or more been cleared from the table; and each went to\nhis or her state-room mastered by various degrees of astonishment.\nFitzgerald moved in a kind of waking sleep.  Napoleon IV!  That there\nwas a bar sinister did not matter.  The dazzle radiated from a single\npoint: a dream of empire!  M. Ferraud had not jested; Breitmann was\nmad, obsessed, a monomaniac.  It was grotesque; it troubled the senses\nas a Harlequin's dance troubles the eyes.  A great-grandson of\nNapoleon, and plotting to enter France!  And, good Lord! with what?\nTwo million francs and half a dozen spendthrifts.  Never had there been\na wilder, more hopeless dreamer than this!  Whatever antagonism or\nanger he had harbored against Breitmann evaporated.  Poor devil, indeed!\n\nHe understood M. Ferraud now.  Breitmann was mad; but till he made a\ndecisive stroke no man could stay him.  So many things were clear now.\nHe was after the treasure, and he meant to lay his hands upon it,\npeacefully if he could, violently if no other way opened.  That day in\nthe Invalides, the old days in the field, his unaccountable appearance\non the Jersey coast; each of these things squared themselves in what\nhad been a puzzle.  But, like the admiral, he wished that there were no\nwomen on board.  There would be a contest of some order, going forward,\nwhere only men would be needed.  Pirates!  He rolled into his bunk with\na dry laugh.\n\nMeantime M. Ferraud walked the deck alone, and finally when Breitmann\napproached him, it was no more than he had been expecting.\n\n\"Among other things,\" began the secretary, with ominous calm, \"I should\nlike to see the impression of your thumb.\""}

{"ID": 1043, "text": "But a wet snow, melting to sleet,\nhad fallen in the night and turned the roads to glass. There was\nmore wet in the air and it seemed likely to both men that the\nweather would \"milden\" toward afternoon and make the going safer.\nEthan therefore proposed to his assistant that they should load the\nsledge at the wood-lot, as they had done on the previous morning,\nand put off the \"teaming\" to Starkfield till later in the day. This\nplan had the advantage of enabling him to send Jotham to the Flats\nafter dinner to meet Zenobia, while he himself took the lumber down\nto the village.\n\nHe told Jotham to go out and harness up the greys, and for a moment\nhe and Mattie had the kitchen to themselves. She had plunged the\nbreakfast dishes into a tin dish-pan and was bending above it with\nher slim arms bared to the elbow, the steam from the hot water\nbeading her forehead and tightening her rough hair into little brown\nrings like the tendrils on the traveller's joy.\n\nEthan stood looking at her, his heart in his throat. He wanted to\nsay: \"We shall never be alone again like this.\" Instead, he reached\ndown his tobacco-pouch from a shelf of the dresser, put it into his\npocket and said: \"I guess I can make out to be home for dinner.\"\n\nShe answered \"All right, Ethan,\" and he heard her singing over the\ndishes as he went.\n\nAs soon as the sledge was loaded he meant to send Jotham back to the\nfarm and hurry on foot into the village to buy the glue for the\npickle-dish. With ordinary luck he should have had time to carry out\nthis plan; but everything went wrong from the start. On the way over\nto the wood-lot one of the greys slipped on a glare of ice and cut\nhis knee; and when they got him up again Jotham had to go back to\nthe barn for a strip of rag to bind the cut. Then, when the loading\nfinally began, a sleety rain was coming down once more, and the tree\ntrunks were so slippery that it took twice as long as usual to lift\nthem and get them in place on the sledge. It was what Jotham called\na sour morning for work, and the horses, shivering and stamping\nunder their wet blankets, seemed to like it as little as the men. It\nwas long past the dinner-hour when the job was done, and Ethan had\nto give up going to the village because he wanted to lead the\ninjured horse home and wash the cut himself.\n\nHe thought that by starting out again with the lumber as soon as he\nhad finished his dinner he might get back to the farm with the glue\nbefore Jotham and the old sorrel had had time to fetch Zenobia from\nthe Flats; but he knew the chance was a slight one. It turned on the\nstate of the roads and on the possible lateness of the Bettsbridge\ntrain. He remembered afterward, with a grim flash of self-derision,\nwhat importance he had attached to the weighing of these\nprobabilities...\n\nAs soon as dinner was over he set out again for the wood-lot, not\ndaring to linger till Jotham Powell left. The hired man was still\ndrying his wet feet at the stove, and Ethan could only give Mattie a\nquick look as he said beneath his breath: \"I'll be back early.\"\n\nHe fancied that she nodded her comprehension; and with that scant\nsolace he had to trudge off through the rain.\n\nHe had driven his load half-way to the village when Jotham Powell\novertook him, urging the reluctant sorrel toward the Flats. \"I'll\nhave to hurry up to do it,\" Ethan mused, as the sleigh dropped down\nahead of him over the dip of the school-house hill. He worked like\nten at the unloading, and when it was over hastened on to Michael\nEady's for the glue. Eady and his assistant were both \"down street,\"\nand young Denis, who seldom deigned to take their place, was\nlounging by the stove with a knot of the golden youth of Starkfield.\nThey hailed Ethan with ironic compliment and offers of conviviality;\nbut no one knew where to find the glue. Ethan, consumed with the\nlonging for a last moment alone with Mattie, hung about impatiently\nwhile Denis made an ineffectual search in the obscurer corners of\nthe store.\n\n\"Looks as if we were all sold out. But if you'll wait around till\nthe old man comes along maybe he can put his hand on it.\"\n\n\"I'm obliged to you, but I'll try if I can get it down at Mrs.\nHoman's,\" Ethan answered, burning to be gone.\n\nDenis's commercial instinct compelled him to aver on oath that what\nEady's store could not produce would never be found at the widow\nHoman's; but Ethan, heedless of this boast, had already climbed to\nthe sledge and was driving on to the rival establishment. Here,\nafter considerable search, and sympathetic questions as to what he\nwanted it for, and whether ordinary flour paste wouldn't do as well\nif she couldn't find it, the widow Homan finally hunted down her\nsolitary bottle of glue to its hiding-place in a medley of\ncough-lozenges and corset-laces.\n\n\"I hope Zeena ain't broken anything she sets store by,\" she called\nafter him as he turned the greys toward home.\n\nThe fitful bursts of sleet had changed into a steady rain and the\nhorses had heavy work even without a load behind them. Once or\ntwice, hearing sleigh-bells, Ethan turned his head, fancying that\nZeena and Jotham might overtake him; but the old sorrel was not in\nsight, and he set his face against the rain and urged on his\nponderous pair.\n\nThe barn was empty when the horses turned into it and, after giving\nthem the most perfunctory ministrations they had ever received from\nhim, he strode up to the house and pushed open the kitchen door.\n\nMattie was there alone, as he had pictured her. She was bending over\na pan on the stove; but at the sound of his step she turned with a\nstart and sprang to him.\n\n\"See, here, Matt, I've got some stuff to mend the dish with! Let me\nget at it quick,\" he cried, waving the bottle in one hand while he\nput her lightly aside; but she did not seem to hear him.\n\n\"Oh, Ethan-Zeena's come,\" she said in a whisper, clutching his\nsleeve.\n\nThey stood and stared at each other, pale as culprits.\n\n\"But the sorrel's not in the barn!\" Ethan stammered.\n\n\"Jotham Powell brought some goods over from the Flats for his wife,\nand he drove right on home with them,\" she explained.\n\nHe gazed blankly about the kitchen, which looked cold and squalid in\nthe rainy winter twilight.\n\n\"How is she?\" he asked, dropping his voice to Mattie's whisper.\n\nShe looked away from him uncertainly. \"I don't know. She went right\nup to her room.\"\n\n\"She didn't say anything?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nEthan let out his doubts in a low whistle and thrust the bottle back\ninto his pocket. \"Don't fret; I'll come down and mend it in the\nnight,\" he said. He pulled on his wet coat again and went back to\nthe barn to feed the greys.\n\nWhile he was there Jotham Powell drove up with the sleigh, and when\nthe horses had been attended to Ethan said to him: \"You might as\nwell come back up for a bite.\" He was not sorry to assure himself of\nJotham's neutralising presence at the supper table, for Zeena was\nalways \"nervous\" after a journey. But the hired man, though seldom\nloth to accept a meal not included in his wages, opened his stiff\njaws to answer slowly: \"I'm obliged to you, but I guess I'll go\nalong back.\"\n\nEthan looked at him in surprise. \"Better come up and dry off. Looks\nas if there'd be something hot for supper.\"\n\nJotham's facial muscles were unmoved by this appeal and, his\nvocabulary being limited, he merely repeated: \"I guess I'll go along\nback.\"\n\nTo Ethan there was something vaguely ominous in this stolid\nrejection of free food and warmth, and he wondered what had happened\non the drive to nerve Jotham to such stoicism. Perhaps Zeena had\nfailed to see the new doctor or had not liked his counsels: Ethan\nknew that in such cases the first person she met was likely to be\nheld responsible for her grievance.\n\nWhen he re-entered the kitchen the lamp lit up the same scene of\nshining comfort as on the previous evening. The table had been as\ncarefully laid, a clear fire glowed in the stove, the cat dozed in\nits warmth, and Mattie came forward carrying a plate of doughnuts.\n\nShe and Ethan looked at each other in silence; then she said, as she\nhad said the night before: \"I guess it's about time for supper.\"\n\n\nVII\n\n\nEthan went out into the passage to hang up his wet garments. He\nlistened for Zeena's step and, not hearing it, called her name up\nthe stairs. She did not answer, and after a moment's hesitation he\nwent up and opened her door. The room was almost dark, but in the\nobscurity he saw her sitting by the window, bolt upright, and knew\nby the rigidity of the outline projected against the pane that she\nhad not taken off her travelling dress.\n\n\"Well, Zeena,\" he ventured from the threshold.\n\nShe did not move, and he continued: \"Supper's about ready. Ain't you\ncoming?\"\n\nShe replied: \"I don't feel as if I could touch a morsel.\"\n\nIt was the consecrated formula, and he expected it to be followed,\nas usual, by her rising and going down to supper. But she remained\nseated, and he could think of nothing more felicitous than: \"I\npresume you're tired after the long ride.\"\n\nTurning her head at this, she answered solemnly: \"I'm a great deal\nsicker than you think.\"\n\nHer words fell on his ear with a strange shock of wonder. He had\noften heard her pronounce them before-what if at last they were\ntrue?\n\nHe advanced a step or two into the dim room. \"I hope that's not so,\nZeena,\" he said.\n\nShe continued to gaze at him through the twilight with a mien of wan\nauthority, as of one consciously singled out for a great fate. \"I've\ngot complications,\" she said.\n\nEthan knew the word for one of exceptional import. Almost everybody\nin the neighbourhood had \"troubles,\" frankly localized and\nspecified; but only the chosen had \"complications.\" To have them was\nin itself a distinction, though it was also, in most cases, a\ndeath-warrant. People struggled on for years with \"troubles,\" but\nthey almost always succumbed to \"complications.\"\n\nEthan's heart was jerking to and fro between two extremities of\nfeeling, but for the moment compassion prevailed. His wife looked so\nhard and lonely, sitting there in the darkness with such thoughts.\n\n\"Is that what the new doctor told you?\" he asked, instinctively\nlowering his voice.\n\n\"Yes. He says any regular doctor would want me to have an\noperation.\"\n\nEthan was aware that, in regard to the important question of\nsurgical intervention, the female opinion of the neighbourhood was\ndivided, some glorying in the prestige conferred by operations while\nothers shunned them as indelicate. Ethan, from motives of economy,\nhad always been glad that Zeena was of the latter faction.\n\nIn the agitation caused by the gravity of her announcement he sought\na consolatory short cut. \"What do you know about this doctor anyway?\nNobody ever told you that before.\"\n\nHe saw his blunder before she could take it up: she wanted sympathy,\nnot consolation.\n\n\"I didn't need to have anybody tell me I was losing ground every\nday. Everybody but you could see it. And everybody in Bettsbridge\nknows about Dr. Buck. He has his office in Worcester, and comes over\nonce a fortnight to Shadd's Falls and Bettsbridge for consultations.\nEliza Spears was wasting away with kidney trouble before she went to\nhim, and now she's up and around, and singing in the choir.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad of that. You must do just what he tells you,\" Ethan\nanswered sympathetically.\n\nShe was still looking at him. \"I mean to,\" she said. He was struck\nby a new note in her voice. It was neither whining nor reproachful,\nbut drily resolute.\n\n\"What does he want you should do?\" he asked, with a mounting vision\nof fresh expenses.\n\n\"He wants I should have a hired girl. He says I oughtn't to have to\ndo a single thing around the house.\"\n\n\"A hired girl?\" Ethan stood transfixed.\n\n\"Yes. And Aunt Martha found me one right off. Everybody said I was\nlucky to get a girl to come away out here, and I agreed to give her\na dollar extry to make sure. She'll be over to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\nWrath and dismay contended in Ethan. He had foreseen an immediate\ndemand for money, but not a permanent drain on his scant resources.\nHe no longer believed what Zeena had told him of the supposed\nseriousness of her state: he saw in her expedition to Bettsbridge\nonly a plot hatched between herself and her Pierce relations to\nfoist on him the cost of a servant; and for the moment wrath\npredominated.\n\n\"If you meant to engage a girl you ought to have told me before you\nstarted,\" he said.\n\n\"How could I tell you before I started? How did I know what Dr. Buck\nwould say?\"\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Buck-\" Ethan's incredulity escaped in a short laugh. \"Did\nDr. Buck tell you how I was to pay her wages?\"\n\nHer voice rose furiously with his. \"No, he didn't. For I'd 'a' been\nashamed to tell him that you grudged me the money to get back my\nhealth, when I lost it nursing your own mother!\"\n\n\"You lost your health nursing mother?\"\n\n\"Yes; and my folks all told me at the time you couldn't do no less\nthan marry me after-\"\n\n\"Zeena!\"\n\nThrough the obscurity which hid their faces their thoughts seemed to\ndart at each other like serpents shooting venom. Ethan was seized\nwith horror of the scene and shame at his own share in it. It was as\nsenseless and savage as a physical fight between two enemies in the\ndarkness.\n\nHe turned to the shelf above the chimney, groped for matches and lit\nthe one candle in the room. At first its weak flame made no\nimpression on the shadows; then Zeena's face stood grimly out\nagainst the uncurtained pane, which had turned from grey to black.\n\nIt was the first scene of open anger between the couple in their sad\nseven years together, and Ethan felt as if he had lost an\nirretrievable advantage in descending to the level of recrimination.\nBut the practical problem was there and had to be dealt with.\n\n\"You know I haven't got the money to pay for a girl, Zeena. You'll\nhave to send her back: I can't do it.\"\n\n\"The doctor says it'll be my death if I go on slaving the way I've\nhad to. He doesn't understand how I've stood it as long as I have.\"\n\n\"Slaving!-\" He checked himself again, \"You sha'n't lift a hand, if\nhe says so. I'll do everything round the house myself-\"\n\nShe broke in: \"You're neglecting the farm enough already,\" and this\nbeing true, he found no answer, and left her time to add ironically:\n\"Better send me over to the almshouse and done with it... I guess\nthere's been Fromes there afore now.\"\n\nThe taunt burned into him, but he let it pass. \"I haven't got the\nmoney. That settles it.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause in the struggle, as though the combatants\nwere testing their weapons. Then Zeena said in a level voice: \"I\nthought you were to get fifty dollars from Andrew Hale for that\nlumber.\"\n\n\"Andrew Hale never pays under three months.\" He had hardly spoken\nwhen he remembered the excuse he had made for not accompanying his\nwife to the station the day before; and the blood rose to his\nfrowning brows.\n\n\"Why, you told me yesterday you'd fixed it up with him to pay cash\ndown. You said that was why you couldn't drive me over to the\nFlats.\"\n\nEthan had no suppleness in deceiving. He had never before been\nconvicted of a lie, and all the resources of evasion failed him. \"I\nguess that was a misunderstanding,\" he stammered.\n\n\"You ain't got the money?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And you ain't going to get it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, I couldn't know that when I engaged the girl, could I?\"\n\n\"No.\" He paused to control his voice. \"But you know it now. I'm\nsorry, but it can't be helped. You're a poor man's wife, Zeena; but\nI'll do the best I can for you.\"\n\nFor a while she sat motionless, as if reflecting, her arms stretched\nalong the arms of her chair, her eyes fixed on vacancy. \"Oh, I guess\nwe'll make out,\" she said mildly.\n\nThe change in her tone reassured him. \"Of course we will! There's a\nwhole lot more I can do for you, and Mattie-\"\n\nZeena, while he spoke, seemed to be following out some elaborate\nmental calculation. She emerged from it to say: \"There'll be\nMattie's board less, any how-\"\n\nEthan, supposing the discussion to be over, had turned to go down to\nsupper. He stopped short, not grasping what he heard. \"Mattie's\nboard less-?\" he began.\n\nZeena laughed. It was on odd unfamiliar sound-he did not remember\never having heard her laugh before. \"You didn't suppose I was going\nto keep two girls, did you? No wonder you were scared at the\nexpense!\"\n\nHe still had but a confused sense of what she was saying. From the\nbeginning of the discussion he had instinctively avoided the mention\nof Mattie's name, fearing he hardly knew what: criticism,\ncomplaints, or vague allusions to the imminent probability of her\nmarrying. But the thought of a definite rupture had never come to\nhim, and even now could not lodge itself in his mind.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" he said. \"Mattie Silver's not a hired\ngirl. She's your relation.\"\n\n\"She's a pauper that's hung onto us all after her father'd done his\nbest to ruin us. I've kep' her here a whole year: it's somebody\nelse's turn now.\"\n\nAs the shrill words shot out Ethan heard a tap on the door, which he\nhad drawn shut when he turned back from the threshold.\n\n\"Ethan-Zeena!\" Mattie's voice sounded gaily from the landing, \"do\nyou know what time it is? Supper's been ready half an hour.\"\n\nInside the room there was a moment's silence; then Zeena called out\nfrom her seat: \"I'm not coming down to supper.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! Aren't you well? Sha'n't I bring you up a bite of\nsomething?\"\n\nEthan roused himself with an effort and opened the door. \"Go along\ndown, Matt. Zeena's just a little tired. I'm coming.\"\n\nHe heard her \"All right!\" and her quick step on the stairs; then he\nshut the door and turned back into the room. His wife's attitude was\nunchanged, her face inexorable, and he was seized with the\ndespairing sense of his helplessness.\n\n\"You ain't going to do it, Zeena?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" she emitted between flattened lips.\n\n\"Send Mattie away-like this?\"\n\n\"I never bargained to take her for life!\"\n\nHe continued with rising vehemence: \"You can't put her out of the\nhouse like a thief-a poor girl without friends or money. She's done\nher best for you and she's got no place to go to. You may forget\nshe's your kin but everybody else'll remember it. If you do a thing\nlike that what do you suppose folks'll say of you?\"\n\nZeena waited a moment, as if giving him time to feel the full force\nof the contrast between his own excitement and her composure. Then\nshe replied in the same smooth voice: \"I know well enough what they\nsay of my having kep' her here as long as I have.\"\n\nEthan's hand dropped from the door-knob, which he had held clenched\nsince he had drawn the door shut on Mattie. His wife's retort was\nlike a knife-cut across the sinews and he felt suddenly weak and\npowerless. He had meant to humble himself, to argue that Mattie's\nkeep didn't cost much, after all, that he could make out to buy a\nstove and fix up a place in the attic for the hired girl-but Zeena's\nwords revealed the peril of such pleadings.\n\n\"You mean to tell her she's got to go-at once?\" he faltered out, in\nterror of letting his wife complete her sentence.\n\nAs if trying to make him see reason she replied impartially: \"The\ngirl will be over from Bettsbridge to-morrow, and I presume she's\ngot to have somewheres to sleep.\"\n\nEthan looked at her with loathing. She was no longer the listless\ncreature who had lived at his side in a state of sullen\nself-absorption, but a mysterious alien presence, an evil energy\nsecreted from the long years of silent brooding. It was the sense of\nhis helplessness that sharpened his antipathy. There had never been\nanything in her that one could appeal to; but as long as he could\nignore and command he had remained indifferent. Now she had mastered\nhim and he abhorred her. Mattie was her relation, not his: there\nwere no means by which he could compel her to keep the girl under\nher roof. All the long misery of his baffled past, of his youth of\nfailure, hardship and vain effort, rose up in his soul in bitterness\nand seemed to take shape before him in the woman who at every turn\nhad barred his way. She had taken everything else from him; and now\nshe meant to take the one thing that made up for all the others. For\na moment such a flame of hate rose in him that it ran down his arm\nand clenched his fist against her. He took a wild step forward and\nthen stopped.\n\n\"You're-you're not coming down?\" he said in a bewildered voice.\n\n\"No. I guess I'll lay down on the bed a little while,\" she answered\nmildly; and he turned and walked out of the room.\n\nIn the kitchen Mattie was sitting by the stove, the cat curled up on\nher knees. She sprang to her feet as Ethan entered and carried the\ncovered dish of meat-pie to the table.\n\n\"I hope Zeena isn't sick?\" she asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe shone at him across the table. \"Well, sit right down then. You\nmust be starving.\" She uncovered the pie and pushed it over to him.\nSo they were to have one more evening together, her happy eyes\nseemed to say!\n\nHe helped himself mechanically and began to eat; then disgust took\nhim by the throat and he laid down his fork.\n\nMattie's tender gaze was on him and she marked the gesture.\n\n\"Why, Ethan, what's the matter? Don't it taste right?\"\n\n\"Yes-it's first-rate. Only I-\" He pushed his plate away, rose from\nhis chair, and walked around the table to her side. She started up\nwith frightened eyes.\n\n\"Ethan, there's something wrong! I knew there was!\"\n\nShe seemed to melt against him in her terror, and he caught her in\nhis arms, held her fast there, felt her lashes beat his cheek like\nnetted butterflies.\n\n\"What is it-what is it?\" she stammered; but he had found her lips at\nlast and was drinking unconsciousness of everything but the joy they\ngave him.\n\nShe lingered a moment, caught in the same strong current; then she\nslipped from him and drew back a step or two, pale and troubled. Her\nlook smote him with compunction, and he cried out, as if he saw her\ndrowning in a dream: \"You can't go, Matt! I'll never let you!\"\n\n\"Go-go?\" she stammered. \"Must I go?\"\n\nThe words went on sounding between them as though a torch of warning\nflew from hand to hand through a black landscape.\n\nEthan was overcome with shame at his lack of self-control in\nflinging the news at her so brutally. His head reeled and he had to\nsupport himself against the table. All the while he felt as if he\nwere still kissing her, and yet dying of thirst for her lips.\n\n\"Ethan, what has happened? Is Zeena mad with me?\"\n\nHer cry steadied him, though it deepened his wrath and pity. \"No,\nno,\" he assured her, \"it's not that. But this new doctor has scared\nher about herself. You know she believes all they say the first time\nshe sees them."}
{"ID": 1286, "text": "The magnitude of the\nsun's disk as seen from Venus, a third larger than it appears to us,\nis also adducted by Mr. Proctor in his posthumous work, \"The Old and\nthe New Astronomy,\" edited and completed by Mr. A.C. Ranyard, as an\nelement in extending the illumination of Venus to more than a\nhemisphere of her surface. As his diameter there is 44-1/4\u00b0, a zone\nof more than 22\u00b0 wide outside the sunward hemisphere is he thinks\nilluminated by direct though partial sunlight, the orb being\nthroughout this tract still partially above the horizon.\n\n[Illustration: GEOGRAPHICAL ASPECT OF VENUS.]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nTHE STARS\n\n(FROM STARLAND.)\n\nBY SIR ROBERT S. BALL.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe group of bodies which cluster around our sun forms a little\nisland, so to speak, in the extent of infinite space. We may\nillustrate this by a map in which we shall endeavor to show the stars\nplaced at their proper relative distances. We first open the compasses\none inch, and thus draw a little circle to represent the path of the\nearth. We are not going to put in all the planets. We take Neptune,\nthe outermost, at once. To draw its path I open the compasses to\nthirty inches, and draw a circle with that radius. That will do for\nour solar system, though the comets no doubt will roam beyond these\nlimits. To complete our map we ought of course to put in some stars.\nThere are a hundred million to choose from, and we shall begin with\nthe brightest. It is often called the Dog Star, but astronomers know\nit better as Sirius. Let us see where it is to be placed on our map.\nSirius is beyond Neptune, so it must be outside somewhere. Indeed, it\nis a good deal further off than Neptune; so I try at the edge of the\ndrawing-board; I have got a method of making a little calculation that\nI do not intend to trouble you with, but I can assure you that the\nresults it leads me to are quite correct; they show me that this board\nis not big enough. But could a board which was big enough fit into\nthis lecture theatre? Here, again, I make my little calculations, and\nI find that there would not be room for a board sufficiently great; in\nfact, if I put the sun here at one end, with its planets around it?\nSirius would be too near on the same scale if it were at the further\ncorner. The board would have to go out through the wall of the\ntheatre, out through London. Indeed, big as London is, it would not be\nlarge enough to contain the drawing-board that I should require. It\nwould have to stretch about twenty miles from where we are now\nassembled. We may therefore dismiss any hope of making a practical map\nof our system on this scale if Sirius is to have its proper place. Let\nus, then, take some other star. We shall naturally try with the\nnearest of all. It is one that we do not know in this part of the\nworld, but those that live in the southern hemisphere are well\nacquainted with it. The name of this star is Alpha Centauri. Even for\nthis star we should require a drawing three or four miles long if the\ndistance from the earth to the sun is to be taken as one inch. You see\nwhat an isolated position our sun and his planets occupy. The members\nof the family are all close together, and the nearest neighbors are\nsituated at enormous distances. There is a good reason for this\nseparation. The stars are very pretty and perfectly harmless to us\nwhere they are at present situated. They might be very troublesome\nneighbors if they were very much closer to our system. It is therefore\nwell they are so far off; they would be constantly making disturbances\nin the sun's family if they were near at hand. Sometimes they would be\ndragging us into unpleasantly great heat by bringing us too close to\nthe sun, or producing a coolness by pulling us away from the sun,\nwhich would be quite as disagreeable.\n\n\nThe Stars are Suns.\n\nWe are about to discuss one of the grandest truths in the whole of\nnature. We have had occasion to see that this sun of ours is a\nmagnificent globe immensely larger than the greatest of his planets,\nwhile the greatest of these planets is immensely larger than this\nearth; but now we are to learn that our sun is, indeed, only a star\nnot nearly so bright as many of those which shine over our heads every\nnight. We are comparatively close to the sun, so that we are able to\nenjoy his beautiful light and cheering heat. Each of those other\nmyriads of stars is a sun, and the splendor of those distant suns is\noften far greater than that of our own. We are, however, so enormously\nfar from them that they appear dwindled down to insignificance. To\njudge impartially between our sun or star and such a sun or star as\nSirius we should stand halfway between the two; it is impossible to\nmake a fair estimate when we find ourselves situated close to one star\nand a million times as far from the other. After allowance is made for\nthe imperfections of our point of view, we are enabled to realize the\nmajestic truth that the sun is no more than a star, and that the other\nstars are no less than suns. This gives us an imposing idea of the\nextent and magnificence of the universe in which we are situated. Look\nlip at the sky at night--you will see a host of stars; try to think\nthat every one of them is itself a sun. It may probably be that those\nsuns have planets circling round them, but it is hopeless for us to\nexpect to see such planets. Were you standing on one of those stars\nand looking towards our system, you would not perceive the sun to be\nthe brilliant and gorgeous object that we know so well. If you could\nsee him at all, he would merely seem like a star, not nearly as bright\nas many of those you can see at night. Even if you had the biggest of\ntelescopes to aid your vision, you could never discern from one of\nthese bodies the planets which surround the sun, no astronomer in the\nstars could see Jupiter, even if his sight were a thousand times as\npowerful as any sight or telescope that we know. So minute an object\nas our earth would, of course, be still more hopelessly beyond the\npossibility of vision.\n\n\nThe Number of the Stars.\n\nTo count the stars involves a task which lies beyond the power of man\nto accomplish. Even without the aid of any telescope, we can see a\ngreat multitude of stars from this part of the world. There are also\nmany constellations in the southern hemisphere which never appear\nabove our horizon. If, however, we were to go to the equator, then, by\nwaiting there for a twelve-month, all the stars in the heavens would\nhave been successively exposed to view. An astronomer, Houzeau, with\nthe patience to count them, enumerated about six thousand. This is the\nnaked-eye estimate of the star-population of the heavens; but if\ninstead of relying on unaided vision, you get the assistance of a\nlittle telescope, you will be astounded at the enormous multitude of\nstars which are disclosed.\n\n[Illustration: FIG 1. THE GREAT BEAR AND THE POLE.]\n\nAn ordinary opera-glass or binocular is a very useful instrument for\nlooking at the stars in the heavens. If you employ an instrument of\nthis sort, you will be amazed to find that the heavens teem with\nadditional hosts of stars that your unaided vision would never have\ngiven you knowledge of. Any part of the sky may be observed; but, just\nto give an illustration, I shall take one special region, namely, that\nof the Great Bear (Fig. 1). The seven well-known stars are here shown,\nfour of which form a sort of oblong, while the other three represent\nthe tail. I would like you to make this little experiment. On a fine\nclear night, count how many stars there are within this oblong; they\nare all very faint, but you will be able to see a few, and, with good\nsight, and on a clear night, you may see perhaps ten. Next take your\nopera-glass and sweep it over the same region; if you will carefully\ncount the stars it shows, you will find fully two hundred; so that\nthe opera-glass has, in this part of the sky, revealed nearly twenty\ntimes as many stars as could be seen without its aid. As six thousand\nstars can be seen by the eye all over the heavens, we may fairly\nexpect that twenty times that number--that is to say, one hundred and\ntwenty thousand stars--could be shown by the opera-glass over the\nentire sky. Let us go a step further, and employ a telescope, the\nobject-glass of which is three inches across. This is a useful\ntelescope to have, and, if a good one, will show multitudes of\npleasing objects, though an astronomer would not consider it very\npowerful. An instrument like this, small enough to be carried in the\nhand, has been applied to the task of enumerating the stars in the\nnorthern half of the sky, and three hundred and twenty thousand stars\nwere counted. Indeed, the actual number that might have been seen with\nit is considerably greater, for when the astronomer Argelander made\nthis memorable investigation he was unable to reckon many of the stars\nin localities where they lay very close together. This grand count\nonly extended to half the sky, and, assuming that the other half is as\nrichly inlaid with stars, we see that a little telescope like that we\nhave supposed will, when swept over the heavens, reveal a number of\nstars which exceeds that of the population of any city in England\nexcept London. It exhibits more than one hundred times as many stars\nas our eyes could possibly reveal. Still, we are only at the beginning\nof the count; the very great telescopes add largely to the number.\nThere are multitudes of stars which in small instruments we cannot\nsee, but which are distinctly visible from our great observatories.\nThat telescope would be still but a comparatively small one which\nwould show as many stars in the sky as there are people living in the\nmighty city of London; and with the greatest instruments, the tale of\nstars has risen to a number far greater than that of the entire\npopulation of Great Britain.\n\nIn addition to those stars which the largest telescopes show us, there\nare myriads which make their presence evident in a wholly different\nway. It is only in quite recent times that an attempt has been made to\ndevelop fully the powers of photography in representing the celestial\nobjects. On a photographic plate which has been exposed to the sky in\na great telescope the stars are recorded by thousands. Many of these\nmay, of course, be observed with a good telescope, but there are not a\nfew others which no one ever saw in a telescope, which apparently no\none ever could see, though the photograph is able to show them. We do\nnot, however, employ a camera like that which the photographer uses\nwho is going to take your portrait. The astronomer's plate is put into\nhis telescope, and then the telescope is turned towards the sky. On\nthat plate the stars produce their images, each by its own light. Some\nof these images are excessively faint, but we give a very long\nexposure of an hour or two hours; sometimes as much as four hours'\nexposure is given to a plate so sensitive that a mere fraction of a\nsecond would sufficiently expose it during the ordinary practice of\ntaking a photograph in daylight. We thus afford sufficient time to\nenable the fainter objects to indicate their presence upon the\nsensitive film. Even with an exposure of a single hour a picture\nexhibiting sixteen thousand stars has been taken by Mr. Isaac Roberts,\nof Liverpool. Yet the portion of the sky which it represents is only\none ten-thousandth part of the entire heavens. It should be added that\nthe region which Mr. Roberts has photographed is furnished with stars\nin rather exceptional profusion.\n\nHere, at last, we have obtained some conception of the sublime scale\non which the stellar universe is constructed. Yet even these plates\ncannot represent all the stars that the heavens contain. We have every\nreason for knowing that with larger telescopes, with more sensitive\nplates, with more prolonged exposures, ever fresh myriads of stars\nwill be brought within our view.\n\nYou must remember that every one of these stars is truly a sun, a\nlamp, as it were, which doubtless gives light to other objects in its\nneighborhood as our sun sheds light upon this earth and the other\nplanets. In fact, to realize the glories of the heavens you should try\nto think that the brilliant points you see are merely the luminous\npoints of the otherwise invisible universe.\n\nStanding one fine night on the deck of a Cunarder we passed in open\nocean another great Atlantic steamer. The vessel was near enough for\nus to see not only the light from the mast-head but also the little\nbeams from the several cabin ports; and we could see nothing of the\nship herself. Her very existence was only known to us by the twinkle\nof these lights. Doubtless her passengers could see, and did see, the\nsimilar lights from our own vessel, and they probably drew the correct\ninference that these lights indicated a great ship.\n\nConsider the multiplicity of beings and objects in a ship: the\ncaptain and the crew, the passengers, the cabins, the engines, the\nboats, the rigging, and the stores. Think of all the varied interests\nthere collected and then reflect that out on the ocean, at night, the\nsole indication of the existence of this elaborate structure was given\nby the few beams of light that happened to radiate from it. Now raise\nyour eyes to the stars; there are the twinkling lights. We cannot see\nwhat those lights illuminate, we can only conjecture what untold\nwealth of non-luminous bodies may also lie in their vicinity; we may,\nhowever, feel certain that just as the few gleaming lights from a ship\nare utterly inadequate to give a notion of the nature and the contents\nof an Atlantic steamer, so are the twinkling stars utterly inadequate\nto give even the faintest conception of the extent and the interest of\nthe universe. We merely see self-luminous bodies, but of the\nmultitudes of objects and the elaborate systems of which these bodies\nare only the conspicuous points we see nothing and we know very\nlittle. We are, however, entitled to infer from an examination of our\nown star--the sun--and of the beautiful system by which it is\nsurrounded, that these other suns may be also splendidly attended.\nThis is quite as reasonable a supposition as that a set of lights seen\nat night on the Atlantic Ocean indicates the existence of a fine ship.\n\n\nThe Clusters of Stars.\n\nOn a clear night you can often see, stretching across the sky, a track\nof faint light, which is known to astronomers as the \"Milky Way.\" It\nextends below the horizon, and then round the earth to form a girdle\nabout the heavens. When we examine the Milky Way with a telescope we\nfind, to our amazement, that it consists of myriads of stars, so small\nand so faint that we are not able to distinguish them individually; we\nmerely see the glow produced from their collective rays. Remembering\nthat our sun is a star, and that the Milky Way surrounds us, it would\nalmost seem as if our sun were but one of the host of stars which form\nthis cluster.\n\nThere are also other clusters of stars, some of which are exquisitely\nbeautiful telescopic spectacles. I may mention a celebrated pair of\nthese objects which lies in the constellation of Perseus. The sight of\nthem in a great telescope is so imposing that no one who is fit to\nlook through a telescope could resist a shout of wonder and admiration\nwhen first they burst on his view. But there are other clusters. Here\nis a picture of one which is known as the \"Globular Cluster in the\nCentaur\" (Fig. 2). It consists of a ball of stars, so far off that,\nhowever large these several suns may actually be, they have dwindled\ndown to extremely small points of light. A homely illustration may\nserve to show the appearance which a globular cluster presents in a\ngood telescope. I take a pepper-caster, and on a sheet of white paper\nI begin to shake out the pepper until there is a little heap at the\ncentre and other grains are scattered loosely about. Imagine that\nevery one of those grains of pepper was to be transformed into a tiny\nelectric light, and then you have some idea of what a cluster of stars\nwould look like when viewed through a telescope of sufficient power.\nThere are multitudes of such groups scattered through the depths of\nspace. They require our biggest telescopes to show them adequately. We\nhave seen that our sun is a star, being only one of a magnificent\ncluster that forms the Milky Way. We have also seen that there are\nother groups scattered through the length and depth of space. It is\nthus we obtain a notion of the rank which our earth holds in the\nscheme of things celestial.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. GLOBULAR CLUSTER IN THE CENTAUR.]\n\n\nThe Rank of the Earth as a Globe in Space.\n\nLet me give an illustration with the view of explaining more fully the\nnature of the relation which the earth bears to the other globes which\nabound through space, and you must allow me to draw a little upon my\nimagination. I shall suppose that the mails of our country extend not\nonly over this globe, but that they also communicate with other\nworlds; that postal arrangements exist between Mars and the earth,\nbetween the sun and Orion--in fact, everywhere throughout the whole\nextent of the universe. We shall consider how our letters are to be\naddressed. Let us take the case of Mr. John Smith, merchant, who lives\nat 1001, Piccadilly; and let us suppose that Mr. John Smith's business\ntransactions are of such an extensive nature that they reach not only\nall over this globe, but away throughout space. I shall suppose that\nthe firm has a correspondent residing--let us say in the constellation\nof the Great Bear; and when this man of business wants to write to Mr.\nSmith from these remote regions, what address must he put upon the\nletter, so that the Postmaster-General of the universe shall make no\nmistake about its delivery? He will write as follows:--\n\n  MR. JOHN SMITH,\n    1001 Piccadilly,\n      London,\n        England,\n          Europe,\n            Earth,\n              Near the Sun,\n                Milky Way,\n                  The Universe.\n\nLet us now see what the several lines of this address mean. Of course\nwe put down the name of Mr. John Smith in the first line, and then we\nwill add \"1001 Piccadilly\" for the second; but as the people in the\nGreat Bear are not likely to know where Piccadilly is, we shall add\n\"London\" underneath. As even London itself cannot be well known\neverywhere, it is better to write \"England.\" This would surely find\nMr. John Smith from any post-office on this globe. From other globes,\nhowever, the supreme importance of England may not be so immediately\nrecognized, and therefore it is as well to add another line, \"Europe.\"\nThis ought to be sufficient, I think, for any post-office in the solar\nsystem. Europe is big enough to be visible from Mars or Venus, and\nshould be known to the post-office people there, just as we know and\nhave names for the continents on Mars. But further away there might be\na little difficulty; from Uranus and Neptune the different regions on\nour earth can never have been distinguished, and therefore we must add\nanother line to indicate the particular globe of the solar system\nwhich contains Europe. Mark Twain tells us that there was always one\nthing in astronomy which specially puzzled him, and that was to know\nhow we found out the names of the stars. We are, of course, in\nhopeless ignorance of the name by which this earth is called among\nother intelligent beings elsewhere who can see it. I can only adopt\nthe title of \"Earth,\" and therefore I add this line. Now our address\nis so complete that from anywhere in the solar system--from Mercury,\nfrom Jupiter, or Neptune--there ought to be no mistake about the\nletter finding its way to Mr. John Smith. But from his correspondent\nin the Great Bear this address would be still incomplete; they cannot\nsee our earth from there, and even the sun himself only looks like a\nsmall star--like one, in fact, of thousands of stars elsewhere.\nHowever, each star can be distinguished, and our sun may, for\ninstance, be recognized from the Great Bear by some designation. We\nshall add the line \"Near the Sun,\" and then I think that from this\nconstellation, or from any of the other stars around us, the address\nof Mr. John Smith may be regarded as complete. But Mr. Smith's\ncorrespondence may be still wider. He may have an agent living in the\ncluster of Perseus or on some other objects still fainter and more\ndistant; then \"Near the Sun\" is utterly inadequate as a concluding\nline to the address, for the sun, if it can be seen at all from\nthence, will be only of the significance of an excessively minute\nstar, no more to be designated by a special name than are each of the\nseveral leaves on the trees of a forest. What this distant\ncorrespondent will be acquainted with is not the earth or the sun but\nonly the cluster of stars among which the sun is but a unit. Again we\nuse our own name to denote the cluster, and we call it the \"Milky\nWay.\" When we add this line, we have made the address of Mr. John\nSmith as complete as circumstances will permit. I think a letter\nposted to him anywhere ought to reach its destination. To perfect it,\nhowever, we will finish up with one line more--\"The Universe.\"\n\n\nThe Distances of the Stars.\n\nI must now tell you something about the distances of the stars. I\nshall not make the attempt to explain fully how astronomers make such\nmeasurements, but I will give you some notion of how it is done. You\nmay remember I showed you how we found the distance of a globe that\nwas hung from the ceiling. The principle of the method for finding the\ndistance of a star is somewhat similar, except that we make the two\nobservations not from the two ends of a table, not even from opposite\nsides of the earth, but from two opposite points on the earth's orbit,\nwhich are therefore at a distance of one hundred and eighty-six\nmillion miles. Imagine that on Midsummer Day, when standing on the\nearth here, I measure with a piece of card the angle between the star\nand the sun. Six months later, on Midwinter Day, when the earth is at\nthe opposite point of its orbit, I again measure the angle between the\nsame star and the sun, and we can now determine the star's distance by\nmaking a triangle. I draw a line a foot long, and we will take this\nfoot to represent one hundred and eighty-six million miles, the\ndistance between the two stations; then placing the cards at the\ncorners, I rule the two sides and complete the triangle, and the star\nmust be at the remaining corner; then I measure the sides of the\ntriangle, and how many feet they contain, and recollecting that each\nfoot corresponds to one hundred and eighty-six million miles, we\ndiscover the distance of the star. If the stars were comparatively\nnear us, the process would be a very simple one; but, unfortunately,\nthe stars are so extremely far off that this triangle, even with a\nbase of only one foot, must have its sides many miles long. Indeed,\nastronomers will tell you that there is no more delicate or\ntroublesome work in the whole of their science than that of\ndiscovering the distance of a star.\n\nIn all such measurements we take the distance from the earth to the\nsun as a conveniently long measuring-rod, whereby to express the\nresults. The nearest stars are still hundreds of thousands of times as\nfar off as the sun. Let us ponder for a little on the vastness of\nthese distances. We shall first express them in miles. Taking the\nsun's distance to be ninety-three million miles, then the distance of\nthe nearest fixed star is about twenty millions of millions of\nmiles--that is to say, we express this by putting down a 2 first, and\nthen writing thirteen ciphers after it. It is, no doubt, easy to speak\nof such figures, but it is a very different matter when we endeavor to\nimagine the awful magnitude which such a number indicates. I must try\nto give some illustrations which will enable you to form a notion of\nit. At first I was going to ask you to try and count this number, but\nwhen I found it would require at least three hundred thousand years,\ncounting day and night without stopping, before the task was over, it\nbecame necessary to adopt some other method.\n\nWhen on a visit in Lancashire I was once kindly permitted to visit a\ncotton mill, and I learned that the cotton yarn there produced in a\nsingle day would be long enough to wind round this earth twenty-seven\ntimes at the equator. It appears that the total production of cotton\nyarn each day in all the mills together would be on the average about\none hundred and fifty-five million miles. In fact, if they would only\nspin about one-fifth more, we could assert that Great Britain produced\nenough cotton yarn every day to stretch from the earth to the sun and\nback again! It is not hard to find from these figures how long it\nwould take for all the mills in Lancashire to produce a piece of yarn\nlong enough to reach from our earth to the nearest of the stars. If\nthe spinners worked as hard as ever they could for a year, and if all\nthe pieces were then tied together, they would extend to only a small\nfraction of the distance; nor if they worked for ten years, or for\ntwenty years, would the task be fully accomplished. Indeed, upwards of\nfour hundred years would be necessary before enough cotton could be\ngrown in America and spun in this country to stretch over a distance\nso enormous. All the spinning that has ever yet been done in the world\nhas not formed a long enough thread!\n\nThere is another way in which we can form some notion of the immensity\nof these sidereal distances. You will recollect that, when we were\nspeaking of Jupiter's moons, I told you of the beautiful discovery\nwhich their eclipses enabled astronomers to make."}

This occasioned farther talk; and I saw the\ncompany was pleased with my behaviour, whereof I soon found the\ngood effects.  I was ordered to speak the few words I understood;\nand while they were at dinner, the master taught me the names for\noats, milk, fire, water, and some others, which I could readily\npronounce after him, having from my youth a great facility in\nlearning languages.\n\nWhen dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs\nand words made me understand the concern he was in that I had\nnothing to eat.

This word\nI pronounced two or three times; for although I had refused them at\nfirst, yet, upon second thoughts, I considered that I could\ncontrive to make of them a kind of bread, which might be\nsufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I could make my\nescape to some other country, and to creatures of my own species.\nThe horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his family to\nbring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray.

{"ID": 744, "text": "\nBesides these and other schools which were founded on a basis of Sanskrit scholastic philosophy,\nthere have been many popular religious movements, which from the first appealed directly to\nthe heart of the people in their own tongues.\n\nThe first place in which we see this current in movement is the Maratha country. Here, about\n1290, J\u00f1anesvara or J\u00f1anadeva, popularly known as J\u00f1anoba, composed his J\u00f1anesvari, a paraphrase\nof the Bhagavad-gita in about 10,000 Marathi verses, as well as a number of hymns to Krishna\nand a poem on the worship of Siva. To the same period belonged Namadeva, who was born at Pandharpur,\naccording to some in 1270 and according to others about a century later. Then came Ekanatha,\nwho is said to have died in 1608, and composed some hymns and Marathi verse-translations from\nthe Bhagavata. The greatest of all was Tukaram, who was born about 1608.[32] In the verses\nof these poets the worship of Krishna is raised to a level of high spirituality. Ramananda,\nwho apparently lived between 1400 and 1470 and was somehow connected with the school of Ramanuja,\npreached salvation through Rama to all castes and classes of Northern India, with immense and\nenduring success. To his spiritual lineage belongs Tulsi Das (1532-1623), whose Rama-charita-manasa,\na poem in Eastern Hindi on the story of Valmiki's Ramayana, has become the Bible of the North.\nThe same influences are visible in the poems of Kabir, a Moslem by birth, who combined Hindu\nand Muhammadan doctrines into an eclectic monotheism, and is worshipped as an incarnation of\nGod by his sect. He died in 1518. A kindred spirit was Nanak, the founder of the Sikh church\n(1469-1538).[33]\n\n[Footnote 32: The student may refer to Sir R. G.

{"ID": 1755, "text": "\nAt home, Alena was already up and about; he embraced her fondly,\nclasped her in his arms, kissed her forehead; then he took up the\ninfant and gazed lingeringly, with infinite tenderness, upon her\ninnocent little face.\n\nThe day was glorious; the golden sunlight streamed in through the\nwindows in a shining cataract, betokening the advent of spring, and\nmade pools of molten gold upon the floor. But the snow still lay in\nall its virgin whiteness over the earth.\n\n\nA YEAR OF THEIR LIVES\n\nI\n\n\nTo the north, south, east, and west--in all directions for hundreds\nof miles--stretched forests and bogs enveloped in a wide-spread veil\nof lichen. Brown-trunked cedars and pines towered on high. Beneath\nthere was a thick, impenetrable jungle of firs, alders, wild-berries,\njunipers, and low-hanging birches. Pungent, deep-sunken, lichen-\ncovered springs of reddish water were hidden amidst undergrowth in\nlittle glades, couched in layers of turf bordered by red bilberries\nand huckleberries.\n\nWith September came the frosts--fifty degrees below zero. The snow\nlay everywhere--crisp and dazzling. There was daylight for three or\nfour hours only; the remainder of the time it was night. The sky was\nlowering, and brooded darkly over the earth. There was a tense hush\nand stillness, only broken in September by the lowing of mating elks.\nIn December came the mournful, sinister howling of the wolves; for\nthe rest of the time--a deep, dreadful, overpowering silence! A\nsilence that can be found only in the wastelands of the world.\n\nA village stood on the hill by the river.\n\nThe bare slope descended to the water's edge, a grey-brown granite,\nand white slatey clay, steep, beaten by wind and rain. Clumsy\ndiscoloured boats were anchored to the bank. The river was broad,\ndark, and cold, its surface broken by sombre, choppy, bluish waves.\nHere and there the grey silhouettes of huts were visible; their high,\nprojecting, boarded roofs were covered by greenish lichen. The\nwindows were shuttered. Nets dried close by. It was the abode of\nhunters who went long excursions into the forests in winter, to fight\nthe wild beasts.\n\nII\n\nIn the spring the rivers--now broad, free and mighty--overflowed\ntheir banks. Heavy waves broke up the face of the waters, which sent\nforth a deep, hoarse, subdued murmur, as restless and disquieting as\nthe season itself. The snow thawed. The pine-trees showed resinous\nlights, and exhaled a strong, pungent odour.\n\nIn the day-time the sky was a broad expanse of blue; at dusk it had a\nsoft murky hue and a melancholy attraction. In the heart of the\nwoods, now that winter was over, the first deed of the beasts was\nbeing accomplished--birth. Eider-ducks, swans, and geese were crying\nnoisily on the river.\n\nAt dusk the sky became greenish and murky, merging into a vast tent\nof deepest blue studded with a myriad of shining golden stars. Then\nthe eider-ducks and swans grew silent and went to roost for the\nnight, and the soft warm air was thrilled by the whines of bear-cubs\nand the cries of land-rails. It was then that the maidens assembled\non the slope to sing of Lada and to dance their ancient dances, while\nstrapping youths came forth from their winter dwellings in the woods\nand listened.\n\nThe slope down to the river was steep; below was the rustling sound\nof water among the reeds. Everything was wrapt in stillness, yet\neverywhere the throb and flow of life could be heard. The maidens sat\nhuddled together on the top of the slope, where the granite and slate\nwere covered with scanty moss and yellow grass.\n\nThey were dressed in gaily-coloured dresses: all of them strong and\nrobust; they sang their love-songs--old and sad and free--and gazed\ninto the gathering opalescent mists. Their songs seemed to overflow\nfrom their hearts, and were sung to the youths who stood around them\nlike sombre, restive shadows, ogling and lustful, like the beasts in\ntheir forest-haunts.\n\nThis festive coupling-time had its law.\n\nThe youths came here to choose their wives; they quarrelled and\nfought, while the maidens remained listless, yielding to them in all.\nThe young men ogled and fought and he who triumphed first chose his\nwife. Then he and she together retired from the festival.\n\nIII\n\nMarina was twenty when she proceeded to the river-bank.\n\nHer tall, somewhat heavy body was wonderfully moulded, with strong\nmuscles and snowy skin. Her chest, back, hips, and limbs were sharply\noutlined; she was strong, supple, and well developed. Her round,\nbroad breast rose high; her hair, eye-brows and eye-lashes were thick\nand dark. The pupils of her eyes were deep and liquid; her cheeks\nshowed a flush of red. Her lips were soft--like a beast's--large,\nsensuous and rosy. She walked slowly, moving her long straight legs\nevenly, and slightly swaying from her hips....\n\nShe joined the maidens on the river slope.\n\nThey were singing their mysterious, alluring and illusive songs.\n\nMarina mingled among the crowd of maidens, lay down upon her back,\nclosed her dreamy eyes, and joined in the festive chorus. The\nmaidens' souls became absorbed in the singing, and their song spread\nfar and wide through all the shadowy recesses of the woods, like\nshining rays of sunlight. Their eyes closed in langour, their full-\nblooded bodies ached with a delicious sensation. Their hearts seemed\nto grow benumbed, the numbness spreading through their blood to their\nlimbs; it deprived them of strength, and their thoughts became\nchaotic.\n\nMarina stretched her limbs sensuously; then became absorbed in the\nsinging, and she also sang. She felt strangely inert; only quivering\nat the sound of the lusty, excited voices of the youths.\n\nAfterwards she lay on a couch in her suffocatingly close room; her\nhands were clasped behind her head; her bosom swelled. She stretched,\nopened her dark pensive eyes wide, compressed her lips, then sank\nagain into the drowsy langour, lying thus for many hours.\n\nShe was twenty, and had grown up free and solitary--with the hunters,\nthe woods, and the steep and the river--from her birth.\n\nIV\n\nDemid lived on his own plot of ground, which, like the village, stood\non a hill above the river. But here the hill was higher and steeper,\nsweeping the edge of the horizon. The wood was nearer, and its grey-\ntrunked cedars and pines rose from their beds of golden moss to shake\ntheir crests to the stars and stretch their dark-green forest hands\nright up to the house. The view was wide and sweeping from here: the\ndark, turbulent river, the marsh beyond, the deep-blue billowing\nwoods fringing the horizon, the heavy lowering sky--all were clearly\nvisible.\n\nThe house, made of huge pines, with timbered walls, plain white-\nwashed ceilings and floors, was bestrewn with pelts of bears, elks,\nwolves, foxes, and ermines. Gunpowder and grape-shot lay on the\ntables. In the corners was a medley of lassoes, snares, and\nwolftraps. Some rifles hung round the walls. There was a strong\npungent odour, as though all the perfumes of the woods were collected\nhere. The house contained two rooms and a kitchen.\n\nIn the centre of one of the rooms stood a large, rough-hewn table;\nround it were some low wooden stools covered with bear-skin. This was\nDemid's own room; in the other was the young bear, Makar.\n\nDemid lay motionless for a long time on his bear-skin bed, listening\nto the vibrations of his great body--how it lived and throbbed, how\nthe rich blood coursed through its veins. Makar, the bear,\napproached, laid his heavy paws on his chest, and amicably sniffed at\nhis body. Demid stroked the beast on its ear, and it seemed as if the\nman and animal understood each other. Outside the window loomed the\nwood.\n\nDemid was rugged and broad-shouldered, a large, quiet, dark-eyed,\ngood man. He smelt of the woods, and was strong and healthy. Like all\nthe hunters, he dressed in furs and a rough, home-woven fabric\nstreaked with red. He wore high, heavy boots made of reindeer hide,\nand his coarse, broad hands were covered with broken chilblains.\n\nMakar was young, and, like all young things, he was foolish. He liked\nto roll about, and was often destructive--he would gnaw the nets and\nskins, break the traps, and lick up the gunpowder. Then Demid\npunished him, whereupon Makar would turn on his heel, make foolish\ngrimaces, and whine plaintively.\n\nV\n\nDemid went to the maidens on the slope and took Marina to his plot of\nland. She became his wife.\n\nVI\n\nThe dark-green, wind-swept grass grew sweet and succulent in summer.\nThe sun seemed to shine from out a deep blue ocean of light. The\nnights were silvery, the sky seemed dissolved into a pale, pellucid\nmist; sunset and dawn co-mingled, and a white wavering haze crept\nover the earth. Here life was strong and swift, for it knew that its\ndays were brief.\n\nMarina was installed in Makar's room, and he was transferred to\nDemid's.\n\nMakar greeted Marina with an inhospitable snarl when he saw her for\nthe first time; then, showing his teeth, he struck her with his paw.\nDemid beat him for this behaviour, and he quieted down. Then Marina\nmade friends with him.\n\nDemid went into the woods in the daytime, and Marina was left alone.\n\nShe decorated her room in her own fashion, with a crude, somewhat\nexaggerated, yet graceful, taste. She hung round in symmetrical order\nthe skins and cloth hangings, brightly embroidered with red and blue\ncocks and reindeers. She placed an image of the God-Mother in the\ncorner; she washed the floor; and her multi-coloured room--smelling\nas before of the woods--began to resemble a forest-chapel, where the\nforest folk pray to their gods.\n\nIn the pale-greenish twilight of the illimitable night, when only\nhorn-owls cried in the woods and bear-cubs snarled by the river,\nDemid went in to Marina. She could not think--her mind moved slowly\nand awkwardly like a great lumbering animal--she could only feel, and\nin those warm, voluptuous, star-drenched nights she yielded herself\nto Demid, desiring to become one with him, his strength, and his\npassion.\n\nThe nights were pale, tremulous, and mysterious. There was a deep,\nheavy, nocturnal stillness. White spirals of mist drifted along the\nground. Night-owls and wood spirits hooted. In the morning was a red\nblaze of glory as the great orb of day rose from the east into the\nazure vault of heaven.\n\nThe days flew by and summer passed.\n\nVII\n\nIt snowed in September.\n\nIt had been noticeable, even in August, how the days drew in and\ndarkened, how the nights lengthened and deepened. The wood all at\nonce grew still and dumb; it seemed as though it were deserted. The\nair grew cold, and the river became locked in ice. The twilight was\nslow and lingering, its deepening shadows turning the snow and ice on\nthe river to a keen, frosty blue.\n\nThrough the nights rang the loud, strange, fierce bellowing of the\nelks as they mated; the walls shook, and the hills re-echoed with\ntheir terrible roar.\n\nMarina was with child in the autumn.\n\nOne night she woke before dawn. The room was stifling from the heat\nof the stove, and she could smell the bear. There was a faint glimmer\nof dawn, and the dark walls showed the window frames in a wan blue\noutline. Somewhere close by an old elk was bellowing: you could tell\nit was old by the hoarse, hissing notes of its hollow cries.\n\nMarina sat up in bed. Her head swam, and she felt nauseated. The bear\nlay beside her; he was already awake and was watching her. His eyes\nshone with quiet, greenish lights; from outside, the thin crepuscular\nlight crept into the room through little crevices.\n\nAgain Marina felt the nausea, and her head swam; the lights in\nMakar's eyes were re-enkindled in Marina's soul into a great,\noverwhelming joy that made her body quiver with emotion . . . Her\nheart beat like a snared bird--all was wavering and misty, like a\nsummer morn.\n\nShe rose from her bed of bear-skin furs, and naked, with swift,\nawkward, uncertain steps, went in to Demid. He was still asleep--she\nput her burning arms about him and drew his head to her deep bosom,\nwhispering to him softly:\n\n\"A child ... it is the child....\"\n\nLittle by little, the night lifted and in through the windows came\nthe daylight. The elk ceased his bellowing The room filled with\nglancing morning shadows. Makar approached, sniffed, and laid his\npaws on the bed. Demid seized his collar with his free hand and\npatting him fondly said:\n\n\"That is right, Makar Ivanych--you know, don't you?\" Then turning to\nMarina, he added: \"What do you think, Marinka? Doesn't he know?\nDoesn't the old bear know, Marinka?\"\n\nMakar licked Demid's hand, and laid his head knowingly on his\nforepaws. The night had gone; rays of lilac-coloured light illumined\nthe snow and entered the house. Round, red, and distant rose the sun.\nBelow the hill lay the blue, ice-bound river, and away beyond it\nstretched the ribbed outline of the vast, marshy Siberian forest.\nDemid did not enter it that day, nor on many of the following days.\n\nVIII\n\nThe winter descended.\n\nThe snow lay in deep layers, blue by day and night, lilac in the\nbrief intervals of sunrise and sunset. The pale, powerless sun seemed\nfar away and strange during the three short hours that it showed over\nthe horizon. The rest of the time it was night. The northern lights\nflashed like quivering arrows across the sky, in their sublime and\nawful majesty. The frost lay like a veil over the earth, enveloping\nall in a dazzling whiteness in which was imprisoned every shade of\ncolour under the sun. Crimsons, purples, softest yellows, tenderest\ngreens, and exquisite blues and pinks flashed and quivered fiercely\nunder the morning rays, shimmering in the brilliance. Over all hung\nthe hush of the trackless desert, the stillness that betokened death!\n\nMarina's eyes had changed--they were no longer dark, limpid, full of\nintoxication; they were wonderfully bright and clear. Her hips had\nwidened, her body had increased, adding a new grace to her stature.\nShe seldom went out, sitting for the most part in her room, which\nresembled a forest-chapel where men prayed to the gods. In the\ndaytime she did her simple houskeeping--chopped wood, heated the\nstove, cooked meat and fish, helped Demid to skin the beasts he had\nslain, and to weed their plot of land. During the long evenings she\nspun and wove clothes for the coming babe. As she sewed she thought\nof the child, and sung and smiled softly.\n\nAn overwhelming joy possessed Marina when she thought of her\napproaching motherhood. Her heart beat faster and her happiness\nincreased. Her own possible sufferings held no place in her thoughts.\n\nIn the lilac glow of dawn, when a round moon, solemn and immense,\nglowed in the south-western sky, Demid took his rifle and Finnish\nknife, and went on his sleigh into the forest.\n\nThe pine-trees and cedars stood starkly under their raiment of snow--\nmighty forest giants--beneath them clustered prickly firs, junipers\nand alders. The stillness was profound. Demid sped from trap to trap,\nfrom snare to snare, over the silent soundless snow. He strangled the\nbeasts; he fired, and the crack of his gun resounded through the\nempty space. He sought for the trail of the elks and wolf-packs. He\ndescended to the river and watched for otters, caught bewildered fish\namidst the broken ice, and set his nets afresh. The scenes all round\nhim were old and familiar. The majesty of day died down in the west\non a flaming pyre of vivid clouds, and the quivering, luminous\nstreamers of the north re-appeared.\n\nStanding in his plot of ground in the evening, he cut up the fish and\nmeat, hung it up to freeze, threw pieces to the bear, ate some\nhimself, washed his hands in ice-cold water, and sat down beside\nMarina--big and rugged, his powerful legs wide apart, his hands\nresting heavily on his knees. The room became stifling with his\npresence. He smiled down quietly and good-naturedly at Marina.\n\nThe lamp shone cheerfully. Outside was snow, frost, and peace. Makar\napproached and lounged on the floor. There was an atmosphere of quiet\njoy and comfort in the chapel-like room. The walls cracked in the\nfrost; some towels embroidered in red and blue with reindeer and\ncocks hung over them. Outside the frozen windows was darkness, cold,\nand night.\n\nDemid rose from his bench, took Marina tenderly and firmly in his\narms, and led her to the bed. The lamp flickered, and in the half-\nlight Makar's eyes glowed. He had grown up during the winter and he\nwas now an adult bear--with a sombre, solemn air and a kind of clumsy\nskill. He had a large flat nose and grave, good-natured eyes.\n\nIX\n\nIt was the last days of December. There had been a merry Christmas\nfestival and the snow had lain thick on house and slope. Wolves were\nnow on the trail. Then Marina felt the first stirring of her child;\nsoft, gentle movements, like the touch of eiderdown upon her body.\nShe was filled with a triumphant joy, and pressed her hands softly\nand tenderly to her side; then sang a lullaby of how her son should\nbecome a great hunter and slay a thousand and three hundred elks, a\nthousand and three hundred bears, a thousand and three hundred\nermines, and take the chief village beauty as his wife!\n\nThere was misty frost, the night, and stillness outside--the\nstillness that whispers of death. Wolves crept up to the plot of\nland, sat on their hind-legs and howled long and dismally at the sky.\n\nIn the spring the shores of the river were strewn with wild flocks of\nswans, geese, and eider-ducks. The forest resounded with the stir of\nthe beasts. Its woody depths echoed with the noise of bears, elks,\nwolves, foxes, owls, and woodcocks. The herbage began to sprout and\nflourish. The nights now drew in, and the days were longer. Dawn and\nsunset were lilac and lingering. The twilight fell in pale green,\nshimmering floods of light, and as it deepened and spread the village\nmaidens gathered again on the river slope and sang their songs of\nLada, the Spring God.\n\nIn the morning the sun rose in a glory of golden splendour and swam\ninto the limpid blue heavens. There, enthroned, it spent the many\nhours of spring. Then came the Easter Festival when, according to the\nlegend, the sun smiled and the people exchanged red eggs as its\nsymbol.\n\nX\n\nOn this Festival, Marina became a mother.\n\nThat night the bear left Demid. He must surely have scented the\nspring and gone into the forest to find himself a mate.\n\nHe left late at night, after breaking down the door. It was dark. A\nscarcely noticeable streak of light lay over the eastern horizon.\nSomewhere afar the village maidens were singing their songs of Lada.\n\n\n_A THOUSAND YEARS_\n\n\"LET THE DEAD BURY THE DEAD.\"--_Matthew_, ch. vii.\n\n\nIt was night time when Prince Constantine arrived at his brother's\nlittle cabin. Young Vilyashev himself opened the door, and throughout\nthe brief conversation that ensued they remained in darkness--not\neven a candle was lighted. Tall, lean, cadaverous, dressed in a much-\nworn day suit, his cap under his arm, Constantine stonily listened to\nVilyashev's terse account of their sister's last moments.\n\n\"She died peacefully,\" the young man told his brother, \"and she was\nquite calm to the end, for she believed in God. But she could not rid\nherself of memories of the past. How could she when the present shows\nsuch an awful contrast? Famine, scurvy, typhus, sorrow brood over the\ncountryside. Our old home is the hands of strangers: we ourselves are\noutcasts living in a peasant's cabin. Imagine what this meant to a\ndelicately nurtured woman! Men are wild beasts, brother.\"\n\n\"There were three of us,\" Constantine said with quiet bitterness--\n\"you, Natalia, and myself. It is ended! I travelled here in a cattle-\ntruck, walking from the station on foot--and was too late for the\nfuneral.\"\n\n\"She was buried yesterday. She knew from the first she was dying, and\nwould not stir a step from here.\"\n\n\"Poor girl,\" sighed Constantine. \"She had lived here all her life.\"\n\nHe left abruptly without a word of farewell, and they did not meet\nagain until the next evening: both had spent the day wandering about\nthe valleys.\n\nAt dawn the following morning Vilyashev ascended a steep hill; on the\nflat summit of a tumulus that crowned it he observed an eagle tearing\na pigeon to pieces. At his approach the bird flew up into the clear,\nempty sky, towards the east, emitting a low, deep, unforgettable cry\nthat echoed dolefully over the fragrant fields.\n\nFrom the hill and tumulus could be seen a vast panorama of meadows,\nthickets, villages, and white steeples of churches. A golden sun rose\nand swung slowly above the hill, gilding the horizon, the clouds,\nhill-ridges, and the tumulus; steeping them in wave upon wave of\nshimmering yellow light.\n\nBelow, in wisps and long slender ribbons, a rosy mist crept over the\nfields; it covered everything with the softest of warmly tinted\nlight. There was a morning frost, and thin sheets of ice crackled in\nthe dykes. An invigorating breeze stirred gently, as if but half-\nawakened, and tenderly ruffled fronds of bracken, sliding softly\nupward from moss and roots, tremulously caressing the sweet-smelling\ngrass, to sweep grandly over the hill-crest in ripples and eddies,\nincreasing in volume as it sped.\n\nThe earth was throbbing: it panted like a thirsty wood-spirit. Cranes\nsent their weird, mournful cries echoing over the undulating plains\nand valleys; birds of passage were a-wing. It was the advent of\nteeming, tumultuous, perennial spring.\n\nBells tolled mournfully over the fragrant earth. Typhus, famine,\ndeath spread like a poisonous vapour through the villages, through\nthe peasants' tiny cabins. The windowless huts waved the rotting\nstraw of their thatch in the wind as they had done five hundred years\nago, when they had been taken down every spring to be carried further\ninto the forests--ever eastward--to the Chuvash tribe.\n\nIn every hut there was hunger. In every hut there was death. In every\none the fever-stricken lay under holy ikons, surrendering their souls\nto the Lord in the same calm, stoical and wise spirit in which they\nhad lived.\n\nThose who survived bore the dead to the churches, and went in\nconsternation and dread through the fields carrying crosses and\nbanners. They dug trenches round the villages and sprinkled the dykes\nwith Holy Water; they prayed for bread and for preservation from\ndeath, while the air resounded with the tolling of bells.\n\nNevertheless, at eventide the maidens came to the tumulus arrayed in\ntheir home-woven dresses, and sang their old, old songs, for it was\nspring and the mating season for all living things. Yet they sang\nalone, for their youths had been given to the Moloch of war: they had\ngone to Uralsk, to Ufa, and to Archangel. Only old men were left to\nplough the fields in the spring.\n\nVilyashev stood dejectedly on the crest of the hill, a solitary,\nlonely figure outlined darkly against the clear blue background of\nsky and distance. He gazed unseeingly into space; thought and\nmovement alike were suspended. He was only conscious of pain. He knew\nall was ended. Thus his errant forbear from the north may have stood\nfive hundred years ago, leaning upon his lance, a sword in his chain\ngirdle.\n\nVilyashev pictured him with a beard like Constantine's. He had had\nglory and conquest awaiting him; he strode the world a victorious\nwarrior! But now--little Natalya who had died of famine-typhus had\nrealized that they were no longer needed, neither she, nor\nConstantine, nor himself! She was calling to him across the great\ngulf; it was as if her words were trembling on the air, telling him\nthe hour had struck. The Vilyashev's power had been great; it had\nbeen achieved by force; by force it had been overthrown, the vulture-\nnest was torn to pieces. Men had become ravenous.\n\nThe Prince descended and made his way to the river Oka, ten miles\ndistant, wandering all day through the fields and dales--a giant full\nseven feet high, with a beard to his waist. The heavy earth clung to\nhis boots. At last he flung himself on to the ground, burying his\nface in his hands, and lay motionless, abandoning himself to an\nanxious, sorrowful reverie.\n\nSnow still lay on the lowlands, but the sky was warm, pellucid,\nexpansive. The Oka broadened out rushing in a mighty, irresistible\ntorrent towards its outlet, and inundating its banks. Purling brooks\ndanced and sang their way through the valleys. The wind breathed a\nfeeling of expectancy--sweet, tender, evanescent, like the day-dream\nof a Russian maiden who has not yet known the secrets of love. With\ndelicate gossamer fingers it gently caressed the barren hill that\nfrowned above the Oka, uttering its gentle poignantly-stirring song\nat the same time.\n\nLarks warbled. From all around echoed the happy cries of birds; the\nvernal air thrilled and vibrated in great running arpeggios to the\nwonder-music of the winds. The river alone preserved a rigid silence.\n\nVilyashev brooded a long while beside the swiftly running waters; but\nat sunset's approach he rose hastily, and returned to the tumulus.\nThe sky was wrapped in its evening shroud of deep, mysterious\ndarkness. Set brightly against the sombre background of the tumulus-\ncrowned hill stood shining silver birch trees and dark shaggy firs:\nthey now looked wan and spectral in the fading light. For a fleeting\nmoment the world glowed like a huge golden ball; then the whole\ncountryside was one vast vista of green, finally merging into a deep\nillimitable purple. Down the valley crept the mist, trailing its\nfilmy veils over point and peak and ridge. The air throbbed with the\ncries of geese and bitterns. The hush of the spring-time night set in\nand covered the world--that hush that is more vibrant than thunder,\nthat gathers the forest sounds and murmurs to itself, and weaves them\nall into a tense, vernal harmony.\n\nPrince Constantine's gaunt form struck a sharp note of discord as he\nwalked straight up to the tumulus. His presence breathed conflict and\nstress that accorded ill with the universal peace of nature.\n\nHe greeted his brother, and began to smoke; the light from his\ncigarette illumined his eagle nose and bony brow; his quiet grey eyes\ngleamed with a wintry look.\n\n\"One longs to fly away like a bird in the spring,\" he murmured; then\nadded with a sharp change of tone; \"How did Natalya die?\"\n\n\"In her right mind, thank God! But, she had lived torn by a madness\nof hatred and contempt, loathing all, despising all.\"\n\n\"What wonder, look around you!\" cried Constantine. He hesitated a\nmoment then said softly: \"To-morrow is the Annunciation--the\nrecollection of that festival made me think. Look around!\"\n\nThe tumulus stood out sheer and stark, a grim relic of a bygone age.\nThere was a faint rustling through last year's wormwood. The air\narose from the plains in a crescendo of quivering chords, gushing\nupward like a welling spring. There was the scent of decaying\nfoliage. The sky beyond had darkened, charged to the brim with\nmystery. The atmosphere became moist and cold; the valley lay\nbeneath--empty, boundless, a region of illimitable space.\n\n\"Do you hear?\" Constantine asked.\n\n\"Hear what?\"\n\n\"The earth's groans.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is waking. Do you hear the soft stir and shudder among the\nroots of the flowers and grass? The whisper of the trees, the tremor\nof leaves and fronds? It is the earth's joyful welcome to the\nSpring.\"\n\nConstantine shook his head: \"Not joy ... sorrow. The air is permeated\nwith the scent of decay. To-morrow will see the Annunciation, a great\nfestival, little brother, and that recollection has set me thinking.\nLook round you! Everywhere are savages--men gone mad with blood and\nterror. Death, famine, barbarity ride the world! Idolatry is still\nrampant: to this day men believe in wood-spirits, witches and the\ndevil--and God, oh yes, men still believe in God! They bury their\ndead when the bodies should be burnt. They seek to drive away typhus\nby religious processions!\"\n\nHe laughed mockingly.\n\n\"I stood the whole time in the train to avoid infection. But the\npeople do not even think of that: their one thought is bread. I\nwanted to sleep through the journey; but a wretched woman, starving\nbefore my very eyes, prevented me. She said she was going to a sister\nso as to get milk to drink. She made me feel sick; she could not say\nbread, meat, milk, and butter, but called them 'brud,' 'mate,'\n'mulk,' and 'buzzer'. 'Ah, for a bit of buzzer--how I will ate it and\nenjoy it!' she kept muttering.\n\n\"I tell you, Vilyashev, the people are bewildered. The world is\nreturning to savagery. Remember the history of all times and of all\npeoples--an endless repetition of schisms, deceptions, stupidity,\nsuperstition and cannibalism--not so long ago--as late as the Thirty\nYears War--there was cannibalism in Europe; human flesh was cooked\nand eaten...."}

As the chief among many, Booker Washington's vision is practical and achievable, and outsiders provide evidence to support his goals.

They must explore different counties, collecting the dust of the land and taking in the expansive fields and the smoking chimneys of local homes. However, one mustn't view walking as only an exercise for the body; it's crucial to keep the senses alive and alert. Sadly, some walkers become so fixated on reaching their destination that they lose sight of the journey, walking forward with their heads down like ancestors of old road-builders. They measure their progress with mileposts or other measures of speed and ignore the beautiful sights around them. I, too, fell victim to this habit on a walk through Wales, turning the stroll into a workout and arriving exhausted in the end. However, walking shouldn't be viewed as merely a way to rest or exercise; one should set out in the morning, refreshed and invigorated, with an exultant mood ready to experience the beauty of the world.

Slay me with your\nsword.\"\n\nBut Powell was wise and his head was cool. He had kept in mind the\nwarning to strike only one blow. He called out loudly, so that all\ncould hear him:\n\n\"I will not repeat that.

The Widow Douglas she took\nme for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough\nliving in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and\ndecent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no\nlonger I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again,\nand was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he\nwas going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back\nto the widow and be respectable.

HARE TRIES TO GET A WIFE\n\nBY ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON\n\nOne day the children's mother told them that she was going to spend a few days at a plantation\nsome miles away, taking with her Aunt Nancy, who was anxious to pay a little visit to a daughter\nliving in that neighborhood. Aunt 'Phrony, she told them, had promised to come and look after\nthem during her absence.\n\n\"Oh, please, mamma,\" they begged, \"let Aunt 'Phrony take us nutting? She told us one day that\nshe knew where there were just lots and lots of walnuts.\" So it was arranged that they should\ntake a luncheon with them and make a day of it, Aunt 'Phrony being perfectly willing, for her\nIndian blood showed itself not only in her appearance, but in her love for a free out-of-door\nlife, and her fondness for tramping. She would readily give up a day's work at any time to\ndischarge some wholly insignificant errand which involved a walk of many miles.\n\nThe day was a bright and beautiful one in October, warm, yet with a faint nip of last night's\nfrost lingering in the air. They made a fine little procession through the woods, Aunt 'Phrony\nleading, followed by children, a darky with baskets, her grandson \"Wi'yum,\" and lastly the\ndogs, frisking and frolicking and darting away every now and then in pursuit of small game.\nA very weary and hungry little party gathered about the baskets at one o'clock, and three little\npairs of white hands were stained almost as brown as those of Aunt 'Phrony and William. But\neverybody was happy, and there was a nice pile of walnuts to go back in the large bag which\nWilliam had brought for the purpose. The dogs sat around and looked longingly on, a squirrel\nfrisked hastily across a log near-by, the birds chattered in the trees high above and looked\ncuriously down on the intruders, and presently a foolish hare went scurrying across the path,\nso near the dogs that they sat still, amazed at his presumption, and forbore to chase him.\n\n\"Hi! there goes 'ol' Hyar'!'\" shouted Ned; \"I'm going to see if I can't catch him.\" But he\nsoon gave up the hopeless chase.\n\n\"Was that your 'ol' Hyar',' Aunt 'Phrony; your ol' Hyar' you tell us all about?\" asked little Kit.\n\n\"Bless de chil'!\" said she. \"Naw, 'twuz de ol', ol' Hyar' I done tol' you 'bout, de gre't-gre't-gre't-sump'n-ru'rr\ngrandaddy er dis one, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Aunt 'Phrony,\" said Janey, \"couldn't you tell us some more about the old hare while we sit\nhere and get rested?\"\n\n\"Now de laws-a-mussy,\" said 'Phrony, \"ef we gwine 'mence on de ol' tales I reckon I mought\nez well mek up my min' ter spen' de res' er de day right yer on dis spot,\" and she leaned back\nagainst a pine tree and closed her eyes resignedly.

The\nsearch for divine truth is like gold washing; nothing is of any value\nuntil most has been swept away.\n\n\n2. HERESIES OF SPECULATION\n\n\nOne sort of heresies stands apart from the rest. It is infinitely the\nmost various sort. It includes all those heresies which result from\nwrong-headed mental elaboration, as distinguished from those which are\nthe result of hasty and imperfect apprehension, the heresies of the\nclever rather than the heresies of the obtuse. The former are of endless\nvariety and complexity; the latter are in comparison natural, simple\nconfusions. The former are the errors of the study, the latter the\nsuperstitions that spring by the wayside, or are brought down to us in\nour social structure out of a barbaric past.\n\nTo the heresies of thought and speculation belong the elaborate\ndoctrine of the Trinity, dogmas about God's absolute qualities, such odd\ndeductions as the accepted Christian teachings about the virginity of\nMary and Joseph, and the like. All these things are parts of orthodox\nChristianity. Yet none of them did Christ, even by the Christian\naccount, expound or recommend. He treated them as negligible. It was\nleft for the Alexandrians, for Alexander, for little, red-haired,\nbusy, wire-pulling Athanasius to find out exactly what their Master was\ndriving at, three centuries after their Master was dead. . . .\n\nMen still sit at little desks remote from God or life, and rack their\ninadequate brains to meet fancied difficulties and state unnecessary\nperfections. They seek God by logic, ignoring the marginal error\nthat creeps into every syllogism. Their conceit blinds them to the\nlimitations upon their thinking. They weave spider-like webs of muddle\nand disputation across the path by which men come to God. It would not\nmatter very much if it were not that simpler souls are caught in these\nwebs. Every great religious system in the world is choked by such webs;\neach system has its own. Of all the blood-stained tangled heresies which\nmake up doctrinal Christianity and imprison the mind of the western\nworld to-day, not one seems to have been known to the nominal founder\nof Christianity. Jesus Christ never certainly claimed to be the Messiah;\nnever spoke clearly of the Trinity; was vague upon the scheme of\nsalvation and the significance of his martyrdom. We are asked to suppose\nthat he left his apostles without instructions, that were necessary to\ntheir eternal happiness, that he could give them the Lord's Prayer but\nleave them to guess at the all-important Creed,* and that the Church\nstaggered along blindly, putting its foot in and out of damnation,\nuntil the \"experts\" of Nicaea, that \"garland of priests,\" marshalled by\nConstantine's officials, came to its rescue."}

The guards\nreported they tried to escape and were shot in the attempt. Their fellow-prisoners told a different\nstory. \"The two men were deliberately taken out on the platform between the cars and fired\nupon.

Warning off the interference of any other foreign\nnation, under the policy known as the \"Monroe Doctrine,\" the American people witnessed the\nrepeated efforts of a less favored nation of this hemisphere to release itself from the grasp\nof the oppressor. They witnessed at the periods of each of these revolts their own ships of\nwar patroling the southern coast and the waters adjacent to Cuba to intercept any young Americans\nwhose sympathies might lead them to join the Cuban cause, and they acquiesced, because the\nlaw as it stood exacted it.

{"ID": 1473, "text": "\nMr. Delancy Potts was tall, limp, blond, and, from years of only dubious recognition, rather\nquerulous. He had a solemn eye under a fringe of whitened eyebrow, a long nose, that his wife\noften fondly alluded to as \"aristocratic\" (they were keen on \"blood,\" the Delancy Pottses),\nand a very retreating chin that one saw sometimes in disastrous silhouette against the light.\nDraped in the flowing fullness of hair and beard, his face showed a pseudo-dignity.\n\nImogen saw the Pottses with a very candid eye, and her mind drifted from that distant disposal\nof them to the contrast of the recent meeting, recalling their gestures and postures as they\nsat, with an uneasy assumption of ease, before her mother, of whom, for so many years, they\nhad disapproved more, almost, than they disapproved of municipal corruption and \"the smart\nset.\" As onlooker she had been forced to own that her mother's manner toward them had been\nquite perfect. She had accepted them as her husband's mourners; had accepted them as Imogen's\nfriends; had, indeed, so thoroughly accepted them, in whatever capacity they were offered to\nher, that Imogen felt that a slight enlightenment would be necessary, and that her mother must\nbe made to feel that her own, even her father's acceptance of the Pottses, had had always its\nreservations.\n\nAnd some acceptances, some atonements, came too late. The Pottses had not been the only members\nof the little circle gathered about her father who had called forth her mother's wounding levity.\nShe had taken refuge on many other occasions in the half-playful, half-decisive, \"I hate 'em,\"\nas if to throw up the final barrier of her own perversity before pursuit. Not that she hadn't\nbeen decent enough in her actual treatment, it was rather that she would never take the Pottses,\nor any of the others--oddities she evidently considered them-seriously; it was, most of all,\nthat she would never let them come near enough to try to take her seriously. She held herself\naloof, not disdainful, but indifferently gay, from her father's instruments, her father's friends,\nher father's aims.\n\nLater on, as Imogen grew into girlhood, her mother lost most of the gaiety and all of the levity.\nImogen guessed that storms, more violent than any she was allowed to witness, intervened between\nyoung rebellion and the cautious peace, the hostility that no longer laughed and no longer\nlost its temper, but that, quiet, kind, observant, went its own way, leaving her father to\ngo his. The last memory that came up for her was of what had followed such a storm. It seemed\nto mark an epoch, to close the chapter of struggle and initiate that of acceptance. What the\ncontest had been she never knew, but she remembered in every detail its sequel, remembered\nlying in bed in her placid, fire-lit room and hearing in her mother's room next hers the sound\nof violent sobbing.\n\nImogen had felt, while she listened, a vague, alarmed pity, a pity mingled with condemnation.\nHer father never lost his self-control and had taught her that to do so was selfish; so that,\nas she listened to the undisciplined grief, and thought that it might be well for her to go\nin to her mother and console her, she thought, too, of the line that, tenderly, she would say\nto her--for Imogen, now, was fourteen years old, with an excellent taste in poetry:\n\n    \"The gods approve\n  The depth, but not the tumult, of the soul.\"\n\nIt was a line her father often quoted to her and she always thought of him when she thought of it.\n\nBut, just as she was rising to go on this errand of mercy, her father himself had come in.\nHe sat down in silence by her bed and put out his hand to hers and then she seemed to understand\nall from the very contrast that his silence made. The sobs they listened to were those of a\npassionate, a punished child, of a child, too, who could use unchildlike weapons, could cut,\ncould pierce; she must not leave her father to go to it. After a little while the sobs were\nstill and, as her father, without speaking, sat on, stroking her hair and hand, the door softly\nopened and her mother came in. Imogen could see her, in her long white dressing-gown, with\nher wide braids falling on either side, all the traces of weeping carefully effaced. She often\ncame in so to kiss Imogen good-night, gently, and with a slight touch of shyness, as though\nshe knew herself shut away from the inner chamber of the child's heart, and the moment was\ntheir tenderest, for Imogen, understanding, though powerless to respond, never felt so sorry\nor so fond as then. But to-night her mother, seeing them there together hand in hand, seeing\nthat they must have listened to her own intemperate grief,--their eyes gravely, unitedly judging\nher told her that,--seeing that her husband, as at the very beginning, had found at once his\nally, drew back quickly and went away without a word. Whatever the cause of contest, Imogen\nknew that in this silent confrontation of each other in her presence was the final severance.\nAfter that her mother had acquiesced.\n\nShe acquiesced, but she yielded nothing, confessed nothing. One couldn't tell whether she,\ntoo, judged, but one suspected it, and the dim sense of an alien standard placed over against\nthem more and more closely drew Imogen and her father together for mutual sustainment. If,\nhowever, her mother judged, she never expressed judgment; and if she felt the need of sustainment,\nshe never claimed it. It would, indeed, have been rather fruitless to claim it from the fourth\nmember of the family group. Eddy seemed so little to belong to the group. As far as he went,\nto be sure, he went always with her and against his father, but then Eddy never went far enough\nto form any sort of a bulwark. A cheerful, smiling, hard young pagan, Eddy, frankly bored by\nhis father, coolly fond of his mother, avoiding the one, but capable of little effective demonstration\ntoward the other. Eddy liked achievement, exactitude, a serene, smiling outlook, and was happily\nabsorbed in his own interests.\n\nSo it had all gone on,--Imogen traced it, sitting there in her quiet corner, holding balances\nin fair, firm hands,--her mother drifting into a place of mere conventionality in the family\nlife; and Imogen, even now, could not see quite clearly whether it had been she who had judged\nand abandoned her husband, or he who had judged and put her aside. In either case she could\nsum it up, her eyes lifted once more to the portrait's steady eyes, with, \"Poor, wonderful papa.\"\n\nHe was gone, the dear, the wonderful one, and she was left single-handed to carry on his work.\nWhat this work was loomed largely, though vaguely, for her. The three slender volumes, literary\nand ethical, were the only permanent testament that her father had given to the world; and\ndealing, as in the main they did, with ultimate problems, their keynote an illumined democracy\nthat saw in most of the results as yet achieved by his country a base travesty of the doctrine,\nthe largeness of their grasp was perhaps a trifle loose. Imogen did not see it. Her appreciation\nwas more of aims than of achievements; but she felt that her father's writings were the body,\nonly, of his message; its spirit lived--lived in herself and in all those with whom he had\ncome in fruitful--contact. It was to hand on the meaning of that spirit that she felt herself\ndedicated. Perfect, unflinching truth; the unfaltering bearing witness to all men of his conception\nof right; the seeing of her own personality as but an instrument in the service of good--these\nwere the chief words of the gospel. Life in its realest sense meant only this dedication. To\nserve, to love, to be the truth. Her eyes on her father's pictured eyes, Imogen smiled into\nthem, promising him and herself that she would not fail.\n\nVII\n\nIt was in the library next morning that Valerie asked Imogen to join her, and the girl, who\nhad come into the room with her light, soft step, paused to kiss her mother's forehead before\ngoing to the opposite seat.\n\n\"Deep in ways and means, mamma dear?\" she asked her. \"Why, you are quite a business woman.\"\n\"Quite,\" Valerie replied. \"I have been going over things with Mr. Haliwell, you know.\" She\nsmiled thoughtfully at Imogen, preoccupied, as the girl could see, by what she had to say.\n\nImogen was slightly ruffled by the flavor of assurance that she felt in her mother, as of someone\nwho, after gently and vaguely fumbling about for a clue to her own meaning in new conditions,\nhad suddenly found something to which she held very firmly. Imogen was rejoiced for her that\nshe should find a field of real usefulness-were it only that of housekeeping and seeing to\nweekly bills; but there was certainly a touch of the inappropriate, perhaps of the grotesque,\nin any assumption on her mother's part of maturity and competence. She therefore smiled back\nat her with much the same tolerantly interested smile that a parent might bestow on a child's\nbrick-building of a castle.\n\n\"I'm so glad that you have that to give yourself to, mama dear,\" she said. \"You shall most\ncertainly be our business woman and add figures and keep an eye on investment to your heart's\ncontent. I know absolutely nothing of the technical side of money--I've thought of it only\nas an instrument, a responsibility, a power given me in trust for others.\"\n\nValerie, whose warmth of tint and softness of outline seemed dimmed and sharpened, as though\nby a controlled anxiety, glanced at her daughter, gravely and a little timidly. And as, in\nsilence, she lightly dotted her pen over the paper under her hand, uncertain, apparently, with\nwhat words to approach the subject, it was Imogen, again, who spoke, kindly, but with a touch\nof impatience.\n\n\"We mustn't be too long over our talk, dear. I must meet Miss Bocock at twelve.\"\n\n\"Miss Bocock?\" Valerie was vague. \"Have I met her?\"\n\n\"Not yet. She is a _prot\u00e9g\u00e9e_ of mine--English--a Newnham woman--a folk-lorist. I heard of\nher from some Boston friends, read her books, and induced her to come over and lecture to us\nthis winter. We are arranging about the lectures now. I've got up a big class for her--when\nI say 'I,' I mean, of course, with the help of all my dear, good friends who are always so\nready to back me up in my undertakings. She is an immensely interesting woman; ugly, dresses\ntastelessly; but one doesn't think of that when one is listening to her. She has a wonderful\nmind; strong, disciplined, stimulating. I'm very happy that I've been able to give America\nto her and her to America.\"\n\n\"She must be very interesting,\" said Valerie. \"I shall like hearing her. We will get through\nour business as soon as possible so that you may keep your appointment.\" And now, after this\ndigression, she seemed to find it easier to plunge. \"You knew that your father had left very\nlittle money, Imogen.\"\n\nImogen, her hands lightly folded in her lap, sat across the table, all mild attention.\n\n\"No, I didn't, mama. We never talked about money, he and I.\"\n\n\"No; still--you spent it.\"\n\n\"Papa considered himself only a steward for what he had. He used his money, he did not hoard\nit, mama dear. Indeed, I know that his feeling against accumulations of capital, against all\nprivate property, unless used for the benefit of all, was very strong.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Valerie, after a slight pause, in which she did not raise her eyes from the paper\nwhere her pen now drew a few neat lines. \"Yes. But he has left very little for Eddy, very little\nfor you; it was that I was thinking of.\"\n\nAt this Imogen's face from gentle grew very grave.\n\n\"Mama dear, I don't think that you and papa would have agreed about the upbringing of a man.\nYou have the European standpoint; we don't hold with that over here. We believe in equipping\nthe man, giving him power for independence, and we expect him to make his own way. Papa would\nrather have had Eddy work on the roads for his bread than turn him into a _fain\u00e9ant_.\"\n\nValerie drew her lines into a square before saying, \"I, you know, with Mr. Haliwell, am one\nof your trustees. He tells me that your father gave you a great deal.\"\n\n\"Whatever I asked. He had perfect trust in me. Our aims were the same.\"\n\n\"And how did you spend it? Don't imagine that I'm finding fault.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know that you couldn't well do that!\" said Imogen with a smile a little bitter. \"I spent\nvery little on myself.\" And she continued, with somewhat the manner of humoring an exacting\nchild: \"You see, I helped a great many people; I sent two girls to college; I sent a boy--such\na dear, fine boy--for three years' art-study in Paris; he is getting on so well. There is my\ngirls' club on the East side, my girls' club in Vermont; there is the Crippled Children's Home,--quite\nnumberless charities I'm interested in. It's been one thing after another, money has not lacked,--but\ntime has, to answer all the claims upon me. And then,\" here Imogen smiled again, \"I believe\nin the claims of the self, too, when they are disciplined and harmonized into a larger experience.\nThere has been music to keep up; friends to see and to make things nice for; flowers to send\nto sick friends; concerts to send poor friends to; dinners and lunches to give so that friends\nmay meet--all the thousand and one little things that a large, rich life demands of one.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Valerie, who had nodded at intervals during the list. \"I quite see all that.\nYou are a dear, generous child and love to give pleasure; and your father refused you nothing.\nIt's my fault, too. My more mercenary mind should have been near to keep watch. Because, as\na, result, there's very little, dear, very, very little.\"\n\n\"Oh, your being here would not have changed our ideas as to the right way to spend money, mama.\nDon't blame yourself for that. We should have bled _you_, too!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you wouldn't,\" Valerie said quickly. \"I've too much of the instinctive, selfish mother-thing\nin me to have allowed myself to be bled for cripples and clubs and artistic boys. I don't care\nabout them a bit compared to you and Eddy. But this is all beside the mark. The question now\nis, What are we to do? Because that generous, expensive life of yours has come to an end, for\nthe present at all events.\"\n\nImogen at this sat silent for some moments, fixing eyes of deep, and somewhat confused, cogitation\nupon her mother's face.\n\n\"Why--but--I supposed that you _had_ minded for Eddy and me, mama,\" she said at last.\n\n\"I have very little money, Imogen.\"\n\nImogen hesitated, blushing a little, before saying, \"Surely you were quite rich when papa married\nyou.\"\n\n\"Hardly rich; but, yes, quite well off.\"\n\n\"And you spent it all--on yourself?\"\n\nValerie's color, too, had faintly risen. \"Not so much on myself, Imogen, though I wish now\nthat I had been more economical; but I was ignorant of your father's rather reckless expenditure.\nIn the first years of my marriage, before the selfish mother-thing was developed in me, I handed\na good deal of my capital over to him, for his work, his various projects; in order to leave\nhim as free for these projects as possible, I educated you and Eddy--that, too, came out of\nmy capital. And the building of the house in Vermont swallowed a good deal of money.\"\n\nImogen's blush had deepened. \"Of course,\" she said, \"there is no more reckless expenditure\npossible--since you use the term, mama--than keeping up two establishments for one family;\nthat, of course, was your own choice. But, putting that aside, you must surely, still, have\na good deal left. See how you live; see how you are taken care of, with a maid,--I've never\nhad a maid, papa, as you know, thought them self-indulgences,--see how you dress,\" she cast\na glance upon the refinements of her mother's black.\n\n\"How I dress, my child! May I ask what that dress you have on cost you?\"\n\n\"I believe only in getting the best. This, for the best, was inexpensive. One hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"Twenty pounds,\" Valerie translated, as if to impress the sum more fully on her mind. \"I know\nthat clothes over here are ruinous. Now mine cost only eight pounds and was made by a very\nlittle woman in London.\"\n\nImogen cast another glance, now of some helpless wonder, at the dress.\n\n\"Of course you are so clever about such things; I shouldn't wish to spend my thought--and I\ncouldn't spend my time--on clothes. And then the standard of wages is so scandalously low in\nEurope; I confess that I would rather not profit by it.\"\n\n\"I am a very economical woman, Imogen,\" said Valerie, with some briskness of utterance. \"My\ncottage in Surrey costs me fifty pounds a year. I keep two maids, my own maid, a cook, a gardener;\nthere's a pony and trap and a stable-boy. I have friends with me constantly and pay a good\nmany visits. Yet my income is only eight hundred pounds a year.\"\n\n\"Eight hundred--four thousand dollars,\" Imogen translated, a note of sharp alarm in her voice.\n\"That, of course, would not be nearly enough for all of us.\"\n\n\"Not living as you have, certainly, dear.\"\n\n\"But papa? Surely papa has left something! He must have made money at his legal practice.\"\n\n\"Never much. His profession was always a by-issue with him. I find that his affairs are a good\ndeal involved; when all the encumbrances are cleared off, we think, Mr. Haliwell and I, that\nwe may secure an amount that will bring our whole income to about five thousand dollars a year.\nIf we go on living in New York it will require the greatest care to be comfortable on that.\nWe must find a flat somewhere, unless you cared to live in England, where we could be very\ncomfortable indeed, without effort, on what we have.\"\n\nImogen was keeping a quiet face, but her mother, with a pang of helpless pity and compunction,\nsaw tears near the surface, and that, to control them, she fixed herself on the meaning of\nthe last words. \"Live out of my own country! Never!\"\n\n\"No, dear, I didn't think that you would want to; I didn't want it for you, either; I only\nsuggested it so that you might see clearly just where we stand, and in case you might prefer\nit, with our limited means.\"\n\nImogen's next words broke out even more vehemently. \"I can't leave this house! I _can't_! It\nis my home.\" The tears ran down her face.\n\n\"My poor darling!\" her mother exclaimed. She rose quickly and came round the table to her,\nputting her arm around her and trying to draw her near.\n\nBut Imogen, covering her eyes with one hand, held her off. \"It's wrong. It's unfair. I should\nhave been told before.\"\n\n\"Imogen, _I_ did not know. I was not admitted to your father's confidence. I used to speak\nto you sometimes, you must remember, about being careful.\"\n\n\"I never thought about it. I thought he made a great deal--I thought you had a great deal of\nmoney,\" Imogen sobbed.\n\n\"It _is_ my fault, in one sense, I know,\" her mother said, still standing beside her, her hand\non her shoulder. \"If I had been here I could have prevented some of it. But--it has seemed\nso inevitable.\" The tears rose in Valerie's eyes also; she looked away to conquer them. \"Don't\nblame me too much, dear. I shall try to do my best now. And then, after all, it's not of such\ntragic importance, is it? We can be very happy with what we have.\"\n\nImogen wept on: \"Leave my home!\"\n\n\"There, there. Don't cry so. We won't leave it. We will manage somehow. We will stay on here,\nfor a time at least--until you marry, Imogen. You will probably marry,\" and Valerie attempted\na softly rallying smile, \"before so very long.\"\n\nBut the attempt was an unfortunately timed one. \"Oh, mama! don't--don't--bring your horrible\nEuropean point of view into _that_, too!\" cried Imogen.\n\n\"What point of view? Indeed, indeed, dear, I didn't mean to hurt you, to be indiscreet--\"\n\n\"The economic, materialistic, worldly point of view--that money problems can be solved by a\nthing that is sacred, sacred!\" Imogen passionately declared, her face still hidden.\n\nHer mother now guessed that the self-abandonment was over and that, with recovered control,\nshe found it difficult to pick up her usual dignity. The insight added to her tenderness. She\ntouched the girl's hair softly, said, in a soothing voice, that she had meant nothing, nothing\ngross or unfeeling, and, seeing that her nearness was not, at the moment, welcome, returned\nto her own place at the other end of the table.\n\nImogen now dried her eyes. In the consternation that her mother's statements had caused her\nthere had, indeed, almost at once, arisen the consoling figure of Jack Pennington, and she\ndid not know whether she were the more humiliated by her own grief, for such a mercenary cause,\nor by this stilling of it, this swift realization that the cramped life need last no longer,\nfor herself, than she chose."}
{"ID": 909, "text": "There are also _N. Devonensis_, bearing flowers of a brilliant\nred, which often measure from twelve to fourteen inches across, are\nstar-shaped, and very beautiful. _N. c\u00e6rulea_, a native of Egypt, has\nlight blue flowers, and light green leaves; the flowers are very\nfragrant. _N. flava_ has yellowish flowers, sometimes beautifully\nvariegated with brown. There is quite a number of other interesting\nspecies, but those already mentioned are the best. The cultivation of\nWater Lilies is very simple, they can be grown with success in tubs or\ntanks, or in little artificial ponds, constructed to accommodate them. A\nhogshead sunk in the ground in the open air, in some sunny location,\nwill answer to grow them in. Fill a hogshead half full of the compost\nrecommended for aquatics, then set the plants in the compost, press\ndown firmly, and fill the cask with pure water. If possible connect a\nflow and waste pipe with the barrel, to keep the water fresh, as this is\nhighly essential in growing these plants in this manner.\n\nA Mr. Sturtevant, we believe, now of Burlington Co., N. J., is an\nenthusiast on the cultivation of Water Lilies, and no doubt an excellent\nauthority, He has written some valuable hints on the culture of\naquatics, from which we are tempted to quote. He says, \"I will add here\na few words on the possibilities of aquatic gardening. One argument in\nfavor of cultivating tropical lilies in the open air is, that larger\nleaves and flowers are obtained, and in case of the colored kinds,\ngreater depth of color than when under glass.\" And again, \"Let us\nsuppose that you wish to have an aquatic garden, fifty, sixty, or a\nhundred feet in diameter. We will not build it in the stiff form of a\ncircle or oval. There is a small bay, across which we will throw a\nrustic bridge to a peninsula: somewhere on the margin we will build a\nrustic summer-house.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now let us suppose that all has been planted, and come to mid-summer\nperfection. Some morning, before the night-blooming lilies (there are\nvarieties that bloom only in the night), have taken their mid-day sleep,\nlet us ascend the tower, and take a view of the picture.\" He graphically\ndescribes the beauty of this miniature Eden, with all its rare and\nbeautiful tropical plants, which certainly must be enchanting for any\nwho love the beautiful. It is surprising that many people of ample\nmeans, and with good facilities for growing aquatics, and who have a\ntaste for flowers, do not take more interest in domesticating these\nplants. Any one who keeps a gardener can have a very fine show of these\nbeautiful flowers, and a comparatively small outlay will bring good\nresults in a short time. Let those who can, try it.\n\n\nSOIL FOR GROWING AQUATIC PLANTS.\n\nThe best soil for growing aquatics, is that obtained from the bed of a\npond, or a slow, swampy stream, but when this is not readily obtainable,\na mixture of equal parts of good, rich garden loam and stable manure\nwill be almost as good."}

He is convinced that the want of specific acknowledgment will only be felt\nby those who have no idea of the labour and difficulty attendant on the hurried management\nof such a work, and of the impossibility of sometimes giving an explanation, when there really\nis one which would quite satisfy the writer, for the delay or non-insertion of his communication.\nCorrespondents in such cases have no reason, and if they understood an editor's position they\nwould feel that they have no right, to consider themselves under-valued; but nothing short\nof personal experience in editorship would explain to them the perplexities and evil consequences\narising from an opposite course.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPASQUIN will find his suggestion attended to very shortly.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED--W.B.B.--E.H.--R.V.--Philo.--J.B.-- Philobiblion.--J.M.W.--W.--Anglo\nCambrian (with many thanks for his excellent suggestion).--A.T.--Odo.--J.

I am  to leave the door open\nfor a sequel if the public take to it, and  this will save me from butchering a lot of good\nmaterial to no  purpose.  Your letter from Carlisle was pretty like yourself, sir,  as I was\npleased to see; the hand of Jekyll, not the hand of Hyde.   I am for action quite unfit, and\neven a letter is beyond me; so  pray take these scraps at a vast deal more than their intrinsic\nworth.  I am in great spirits about David, Colvin agreeing with  Henley, Fanny, and myself\nin thinking it far the most human of my  labours hitherto.  As to whether the long-eared British\npublic may  take to it, all think it more than doubtful; I wish they would, for  I could do\na second volume with ease and pleasure, and Colvin  thinks it sin and folly to throw away David\nand Alan Breck upon so  small a field as this one. - Ever your affectionate son,\n\nR. L. S.\n\nLetter:  TO MRS. FLEEMING JENKIN\n\n[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], APRIL 15 OR 16 (THE HOUR NOT BEING  KNOWN), 1886.\n\nMY DEAR MRS. JENKIN, - It is I know not what hour of the night; but  I cannot sleep, have lit\nthe gas, and here goes.\n\nFirst, all your packet arrived:  I have dipped into the Schumann  already with great pleasure.\nSurely, in what concerns us there is  a sweet little chirrup; the GOOD WORDS arrived in the\nmorning just  when I needed it, and the famous notes that I had lost were  recovered also in\nthe nick of time.\n\nAnd now I am going to bother you with my affairs:  premising,  first, that this is PRIVATE;\nsecond, that whatever I do the LIFE  shall be done first, and I am getting on with it well;\nand third,  that I do not quite know why I consult you, but something tells me  you will hear\nwith fairness.\n\nHere is my problem.  The Curtin women are still miserable  prisoners; no one dare buy their\nfarm of them, all the manhood of  England and the world stands aghast before a threat of murder.\n(1)  Now, my work can be done anywhere; hence I can take up without loss  a back-going Irish\nfarm, and live on, though not (as I had  originally written) in it:  First Reason.  (2) If\nI should be  killed, there are a good many who would feel it:  writers are so  much in the\npublic eye, that a writer being murdered would attract  attention, throw a bull's-eye light\nupon this cowardly business:   Second Reason.  (3) I am not unknown in the States, from which\nthe  funds come that pay for these brutalities:  to some faint extent,  my death (if I should\nbe killed) would tell there:  Third Reason.   (4) NOBODY ELSE IS TAKING UP THIS OBVIOUS AND\nCRYING DULY:  Fourth  Reason.  (5) I have a crazy health and may die at any moment, my  life\nis of no purchase in an insurance office, it is the less  account to husband it, and the business\nof husbanding a life is  dreary and demoralising:  Fifth Reason.\n\nI state these in no order, but as they occur to me.  And I shall do  the like with the objections.\n\nFirst Objection:  It will do no good; you have seen Gordon die and  nobody minded; nobody will\nmind if you die.  This is plainly of the  devil.  Second Objection:  You will not even be murdered,\nthe  climate will miserably kill you, you will strangle out in a rotten  damp heat, in congestion,\netc.  Well, what then?  It changes  nothing:  the purpose is to brave crime; let me brave it,\nfor such  time and to such an extent as God allows.  Third Objection:  The  Curtin women are\nprobably highly uninteresting females.  I haven't  a doubt of it.  But the Government cannot,\nmen will not, protect  them.  If I am the only one to see this public duty, it is to the  public\nand the Right I should perform it - not to Mesdames Curtin.   Fourth Objection:  I am married.\n'I have married a wife!'  I seem  to have heard it before.  It smells ancient! what was the\ncontext?   Fifth Objection:  My wife has had a mean life (1), loves me (2),  could not bear\nto lose me (3).  (1) I admit:  I am sorry.  (2) But  what does she love me for? and (3) she\nmust lose me soon or late.   And after all, because we run this risk, it does not follow we\nshould fail.  Sixth Objection:  My wife wouldn't like it.  No, she  wouldn't.  Who would? \nBut the Curtins don't like it.  And all  those who are to suffer if this goes on, won't like\nit.  And if  there is a great wrong, somebody must suffer.  Seventh Objection:   I won't like\nit.  No, I will not; I have thought it through, and I  will not.  But what of that?  And both\nshe and I may like it more  than we suppose.  We shall lose friends, all comforts, all society:\nso has everybody who has ever done anything; but we shall have some  excitement, and that's\na fine thing; and we shall be trying to do  the right, and that's not to be despised.  Eighth\nObjection:  I am  an author with my work before me.  See Second Reason.  Ninth  Objection:\nBut am I not taken with the hope of excitement?  I was  at first.  I am not much now.  I see\nwhat a dreary, friendless,  miserable, God-forgotten business it will be.  And anyway, is not\nexcitement the proper reward of doing anything both right and a  little dangerous?  Tenth Objection:\nBut am I not taken with a  notion of glory?  I dare say I am.  Yet I see quite clearly how\nall  points to nothing coming, to a quite inglorious death by disease  and from the lack of\nattendance; or even if I should be knocked on  the head, as these poor Irish promise, how little\nany one will  care.  It will be a smile at a thousand breakfast-tables.  I am  nearly forty\nnow; I have not many illusions.  And if I had?  I do  not love this health-tending, housekeeping\nlife of mine.  I have a  taste for danger, which is human, like the fear of it.  Here is a\nfair cause; a just cause; no knight ever set lance in rest for a  juster.  Yet it needs not\nthe strength I have not, only the passive  courage that I hope I could muster, and the watchfulness\nthat I am  sure I could learn.\n\nHere is a long midnight dissertation; with myself; with you.   Please let me hear.  But I charge\nyou this:  if you see in this  idea of mine the finger of duty, do not dissuade me.  I am nearing\nforty, I begin to love my ease and my home and my habits, I never  knew how much till this\narose; do not falsely counsel me to put my  head under the bed-clothes.  And I will say this\nto you:  my wife,  who hates the idea, does not refuse.  'It is nonsense,' says she,  'but\nif you go, I will go.'  Poor girl, and her home and her garden  that she was so proud of! \nI feel her garden most of all, because  it is a pleasure (I suppose) that I do not feel myself\nto share.\n\n1. Here is a great wrong. 2. \" growing wrong. 3. \" wrong founded on crime. 4. \" crime that\nthe Government cannot prevent. 5. \" crime that it occurs to no man to defy. 6. But it has occurred\nto me. 7. Being a known person, some will notice my defiance. 8. Being a writer, I can MAKE\npeople notice it. 9. And, I think, MAKE people imitate me. 10. Which would destroy in time\nthis whole scaffolding of  oppression. 11. And if I fail, however ignominiously, that is not\nmy concern.   It is, with an odd mixture of reverence and humorous remembrances  of Dickens,\nbe it said - it is A-nother's.\n\nAnd here, at I cannot think what hour of the morning, I shall dry  up, and remain, - Yours,\nreally in want of a little help,\n\nR. L S.\n\nSleepless at midnight's dewy hour.\n     \"          \"       witching \"\n     \"          \"       maudlin \"\n     \"          \"       etc.\n\nNEXT MORNING. - Eleventh Objection:  I have a father and mother.   And who has not?  Macduff's\nwas a rare case; if we must wait for a  Macduff.  Besides, my father will not perhaps be long\nhere.   Twelfth Objection:  The cause of England in Ireland is not worth  supporting.  A QUI\nLE DITES-VOUS?  And I am not supporting that.   Home Rule, if you like.  Cause of decency,\nthe idea that  populations should not be taught to gain public ends by private  crime, the\nidea that for all men to bow before a threat of crime is  to loosen and degrade beyond redemption\nthe whole fabric of man's  decency.\n\nLetter:  TO MRS. FLEEMING JENKIN\n\n[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, APRIL 1886.]\n\nMY DEAR MRS. JENKIN, - The Book - It is all drafted:  I hope soon  to send you for comments\nChapters III., IV., and V.  Chapter VII.  is roughly but satisfactorily drafted:  a very little\nwork should  put that to rights.  But Chapter VI. is no joke; it is a MARE  MAGNUM:  I swim\nand drown and come up again; and it is all broken  ends and mystification:  moreover, I perceive\nI am in want of more  matter.  I must have, first of all, a little letter from Mr. Ewing  about\nthe phonograph work:  IF you think he would understand it is  quite a matter of chance whether\nI use a word or a fact out of it.   If you think he would not:  I will go without.  Also, could\nI have  a look at Ewing's PRECIS?  And lastly, I perceive I must interview  you again about\na few points; they are very few, and might come to  little; and I propose to go on getting\nthings as well together as I  can in the meanwhile, and rather have a final time when all is\nready and only to be criticised.  I do still think it will be good.   I wonder if Trelat would\nlet me cut?  But no, I think I wouldn't  after all; 'tis so quaint and pretty and clever and\nsimple and  French, and gives such a good sight of Fleeming:  the plum of the  book, I think.\n\nYou misunderstood me in one point:  I always hoped to found such a  society; that was the outside\nof my dream, and would mean entire  success.  BUT - I cannot play Peter the Hermit.  In these\ndays of  the Fleet Street journalist, I cannot send out better men than  myself, with wives\nor mothers just as good as mine, and sisters (I  may at least say) better, to a danger and\na long-drawn dreariness  that I do not share.  My wife says it's cowardice; what brave men\nare the leader-writers!  Call it cowardice; it is mine.  Mind you,  I may end by trying to\ndo it by the pen only:  I shall not love  myself if I do; and is it ever a good thing to do\na thing for which  you despise yourself? - even in the doing?  And if the thing you do  is\nto call upon others to do the thing you neglect?  I have never  dared to say what I feel about\nmen's lives, because my own was in  the wrong:  shall I dare to send them to death?  The physician\nmust  heal himself; he must honestly TRY the path he recommends:  if he  does not even try,\nshould he not be silent?\n\nI thank you very heartily for your letter, and for the seriousness  you brought to it.  You\nknow, I think when a serious thing is your  own, you keep a saner man by laughing at it and\nyourself as you go.   So I do not write possibly with all the really somewhat sickened  gravity\nI feel.  And indeed, what with the book, and this business  to which I referred, and Ireland,\nI am scarcely in an enviable  state.  Well, I ought to be glad, after ten years of the worst\ntraining on earth - valetudinarianism - that I can still be  troubled by a duty.  You shall\nhear more in time; so far, I am at  least decided:  I will go and see Balfour when I get to London.\n\nWe have all had a great pleasure:  a Mrs. Rawlinson came and  brought with her a nineteen-year-old\ndaughter, simple, human, as  beautiful as - herself; I never admired a girl before, you know\nit  was my weakness:  we are all three dead in love with her.  How nice  to be able to do so\nmuch good to harassed people by - yourself!   Ever yours,\n\nR. L. S.\n\nLetter:  TO MISS RAWLINSON\n\n[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, APRIL 1886.]\n\nOF the many flowers you brought me, Only some were meant to stay, And the flower I thought\nthe sweetest Was the flower that went away.\n\nOf the many flowers you brought me, All were fair and fresh and gay, But the flower I thought\nthe sweetest Was the blossom of the May.\n\nROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\n\nLetter:  TO MISS MONROE\n\nSKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, MAY 25TH, 1886.\n\nDEAR MISS MONROE, - (I hope I have this rightly) I must lose no  time in thanking you for a\nletter singularly pleasant to receive.   It may interest you to know that I read to the signature\nwithout  suspecting my correspondent was a woman; though in one point (a  reference to the\nCountess) I might have found a hint of the truth.   You are not pleased with Otto; since I\njudge you do not like  weakness; and no more do I.  And yet I have more than tolerance for\nOtto, whose faults are the faults of weakness, but never of ignoble  weakness, and who seeks\nbefore all to be both kind and just.   Seeks, not succeeds.  But what is man?  So much of cynicism\nto  recognise that nobody does right is the best equipment for those  who do not wish to be\ncynics in good earnest.  Think better of  Otto, if my plea can influence you; and this I mean\nfor your own  sake - not his, poor fellow, as he will never learn your opinion;  but for yours,\nbecause, as men go in this world (and women too),  you will not go far wrong if you light upon\nso fine a fellow; and  to light upon one and not perceive his merits is a calamity.  In  the\nflesh, of course, I mean; in the book the fault, of course, is  with my stumbling pen.  Seraphina\nmade a mistake about her Otto; it  begins to swim before me dimly that you may have some traits\nof  Seraphina?\n\nWith true ingratitude you see me pitch upon your exception; but it  is easier to defend oneself\ngracefully than to acknowledge praise.   I am truly glad that you should like my books; for\nI think I see  from what you write that you are a reader worth convincing.  Your  name, if\nI have properly deciphered it, suggests that you may be  also something of my countrywoman;\nfor it is hard to see where  Monroe came from, if not from Scotland.  I seem to have here a\ndouble claim on your good nature:  being myself pure Scotch and  having appreciated your letter,\nmake up two undeniable merits  which, perhaps, if it should be quite without trouble, you might\nreward with your photograph. - Yours truly,\n\nROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\n\nLetter:  TO MISS MONROE\n\n[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, JUNE 1886.]\n\nMY DEAR MISS MONROE, - I am ill in bed and stupid, incoherently  stupid; yet I have to answer\nyour letter, and if the answer is  incomprehensible you must forgive me.  You say my letter\ncaused you  pleasure; I am sure, as it fell out, not near so much as yours has  brought to\nme.  The interest taken in an author is fragile:  his  next book, or your next year of culture,\nmight see the interest  frosted or outgrown; and himself, in spite of all, you might  probably\nfind the most distasteful person upon earth.  My case is  different.  I have bad health, am\noften condemned to silence for  days together - was so once for six weeks, so that my voice\nwas  awful to hear when I first used it, like the whisper of a shadow -  have outlived all\nmy chief pleasures, which were active and  adventurous, and ran in the open air:  and being\na person who  prefers life to art, and who knows it is a far finer thing to be in  love, or\nto risk a danger, than to paint the finest picture or  write the noblest book, I begin to regard\nwhat remains to me of my  life as very shadowy.  From a variety of reasons, I am ashamed to\nconfess I was much in this humour when your letter came.  I had a  good many troubles; was\nregretting a high average of sins; had been  recently reminded that I had outlived some friends,\nand wondering  if I had not outlived some friendships; and had just, while  boasting of better\nhealth, been struck down again by my haunting  enemy, an enemy who was exciting at first, but\nhas now, by the  iteration of his strokes, become merely annoying and inexpressibly  irksome.\nCan you fancy that to a person drawing towards the  elderly this sort of conjunction of circumstances\nbrings a rather  aching sense of the past and the future?  Well, it was just then  that your\nletter and your photograph were brought to me in bed; and  there came to me at once the most\nagreeable sense of triumph.  My  books were still young; my words had their good health and\ncould go  about the world and make themselves welcome; and even (in a shadowy  and distant\nsense) make something in the nature of friends for the  sheer hulk that stays at home and bites\nhis pen over the  manuscripts.  It amused me very much to remember that I had been in  Chicago,\nnot so many years ago, in my proper person; where I had  failed to awaken much remark, except\nfrom the ticket collector; and  to think how much more gallant and persuasive were the fellows\nthat  I now send instead of me, and how these are welcome in that quarter  to the sitter of\nHerr Platz, while their author was not very  welcome even in the villainous restaurant where\nhe tried to eat a  meal and rather failed.\n\nAnd this leads me directly to a confession.  The photograph which  shall accompany this is\nnot chosen as the most like, but the best- looking.  Put yourself in my place, and you will\ncall this  pardonable.  Even as it is, even putting forth a flattered  presentment, I am a\nlittle pained; and very glad it is a photograph  and not myself that has to go; for in this\ncase, if it please you,  you can tell yourself it is my image - and if it displeased you, \nyou can lay the blame on the photographer; but in that, there were  no help, and the poor author\nmight belie his labours.\n\nKIDNAPPED should soon appear; I am afraid you may not like it, as  it is very unlike PRINCE\nOTTO in every way; but I am myself a great  admirer of the two chief characters, Alan and David.\nVIRGINIBUS  PUERISQUE has never been issued in the States.  I do not think it  is a book that\nhas much charm for publishers in any land; but I am  to bring out a new edition in England\nshortly, a copy of which I  must try to remember to send you.  I say try to remember, because\nI  have some superficial acquaintance with myself:  and I have  determined, after a galling\ndiscipline, to promise nothing more  until the day of my death:  at least, in this way, I shall\nno more  break my word, and I must now try being churlish instead of being  false.\n\nI do not believe you to be the least like Seraphina.  Your  photograph has no trace of her,\nwhich somewhat relieves me, as I am  a good deal afraid of Seraphinas - they do not always\ngo into the  woods and see the sunrise, and some are so well-mailed that even  that experience\nwould leave them unaffected and unsoftened.  The  'hair and eyes of several complexions' was\na trait taken from  myself; and I do not bind myself to the opinions of Sir John.  In  this\ncase, perhaps - but no, if the peculiarity is shared by two  such pleasant persons as you and\nI (as you and me - the grammatical  nut is hard), it must be a very good thing indeed, and\nSir John  must be an ass."}
{"ID": 1741, "text": "The pseudo-scientific spirit, or rather, the\nundeveloped stage of our philanthropy, is perhaps most clearly revealed\nin our tendency to lay constant stress on negative action. \"Don't give;\"\n\"don't break down self-respect,\" we are constantly told. We distrust the\nhuman impulse as well as the teachings of our own experience, and in\ntheir stead substitute dogmatic rules for conduct. We forget that the\naccumulation of knowledge and the holding of convictions must finally\nresult in the application of that knowledge and those convictions to\nlife itself; that the necessity for activity and a pull upon the\nsympathies is so severe, that all the knowledge in the possession of the\nvisitor is constantly applied, and she has a reasonable chance for an\nultimate intellectual comprehension. Indeed, part of the perplexity in\nthe administration of charity comes from the fact that the type of\nperson drawn to it is the one who insists that her convictions shall not\nbe unrelated to action. Her moral concepts constantly tend to float away\nfrom her, unless they have a basis in the concrete relation of life. She\nis confronted with the task of reducing her scruples to action, and of\nconverging many wills, so as to unite the strength of all of them into\none accomplishment, the value of which no one can foresee.\n\nOn the other hand, the young woman who has succeeded in expressing her\nsocial compunction through charitable effort finds that the wider\nsocial activity, and the contact with the larger experience, not only\nincreases her sense of social obligation but at the same time recasts\nher social ideals. She is chagrined to discover that in the actual task\nof reducing her social scruples to action, her humble beneficiaries are\nfar in advance of her, not in charity or singleness of purpose, but in\nself-sacrificing action. She reaches the old-time virtue of humility by\na social process, not in the old way, as the man who sits by the side of\nthe road and puts dust upon his head, calling himself a contrite sinner,\nbut she gets the dust upon her head because she has stumbled and fallen\nin the road through her efforts to push forward the mass, to march with\nher fellows. She has socialized her virtues not only through a social\naim but by a social process.\n\nThe Hebrew prophet made three requirements from those who would join the\ngreat forward-moving procession led by Jehovah. \"To love mercy\" and at\nthe same time \"to do justly\" is the difficult task; to fulfil the first\nrequirement alone is to fall into the error of indiscriminate giving\nwith all its disastrous results; to fulfil the second solely is to\nobtain the stern policy of withholding, and it results in such a dreary\nlack of sympathy and understanding that the establishment of justice is\nimpossible. It may be that the combination of the two can never be\nattained save as we fulfil still the third requirement--\"to walk humbly\nwith God,\" which may mean to walk for many dreary miles beside the\nlowliest of His creatures, not even in that peace of mind which the\ncompany of the humble is popularly supposed to afford, but rather with\nthe pangs and throes to which the poor human understanding is subjected\nwhenever it attempts to comprehend the meaning of life.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nFILIAL RELATIONS\n\n\nThere are many people in every community who have not felt the \"social\ncompunction,\" who do not share the effort toward a higher social\nmorality, who are even unable to sympathetically interpret it. Some of\nthese have been shielded from the inevitable and salutary failures which\nthe trial of new powers involve, because they are content to attain\nstandards of virtue demanded by an easy public opinion, and others of\nthem have exhausted their moral energy in attaining to the current\nstandard of individual and family righteousness.\n\nSuch people, who form the bulk of contented society, demand that the\nradical, the reformer, shall be without stain or question in his\npersonal and family relations, and judge most harshly any deviation\nfrom the established standards. There is a certain justice in this: it\nexpresses the inherent conservatism of the mass of men, that none of the\nestablished virtues which have been so slowly and hardly acquired shall\nbe sacrificed for the sake of making problematic advance; that the\nindividual, in his attempt to develop and use the new and exalted\nvirtue, shall not fall into the easy temptation of letting the ordinary\nones slip through his fingers.\n\nThis instinct to conserve the old standards, combined with a distrust of\nthe new standard, is a constant difficulty in the way of those\nexperiments and advances depending upon the initiative of women, both\nbecause women are the more sensitive to the individual and family\nclaims, and because their training has tended to make them content with\nthe response to these claims alone.\n\nThere is no doubt that, in the effort to sustain the moral energy\nnecessary to work out a more satisfactory social relation, the\nindividual often sacrifices the energy which should legitimately go\ninto the fulfilment of personal and family claims, to what he considers\nthe higher claim.\n\nIn considering the changes which our increasing democracy is constantly\nmaking upon various relationships, it is impossible to ignore the filial\nrelation. This chapter deals with the relation between parents and their\ngrown-up daughters, as affording an explicit illustration of the\nperplexity and mal-adjustment brought about by the various attempts of\nyoung women to secure a more active share in the community life. We\nconstantly see parents very much disconcerted and perplexed in regard to\ntheir daughters when these daughters undertake work lying quite outside\nof traditional and family interests. These parents insist that the girl\nis carried away by a foolish enthusiasm, that she is in search of a\ncareer, that she is restless and does not know what she wants. They will\ngive any reason, almost, rather than the recognition of a genuine and\ndignified claim. Possibly all this is due to the fact that for so many\nhundreds of years women have had no larger interests, no participation\nin the affairs lying quite outside personal and family claims. Any\nattempt that the individual woman formerly made to subordinate or\nrenounce the family claim was inevitably construed to mean that she was\nsetting up her own will against that of her family's for selfish ends.\nIt was concluded that she could have no motive larger than a desire to\nserve her family, and her attempt to break away must therefore be wilful\nand self-indulgent.\n\nThe family logically consented to give her up at her marriage, when she\nwas enlarging the family tie by founding another family. It was easy to\nunderstand that they permitted and even promoted her going to college,\ntravelling in Europe, or any other means of self-improvement, because\nthese merely meant the development and cultivation of one of its own\nmembers. When, however, she responded to her impulse to fulfil the\nsocial or democratic claim, she violated every tradition.\n\nThe mind of each one of us reaches back to our first struggles as we\nemerged from self-willed childhood into a recognition of family\nobligations. We have all gradually learned to respond to them, and yet\nmost of us have had at least fleeting glimpses of what it might be to\ndisregard them and the elemental claim they make upon us. We have\nyielded at times to the temptation of ignoring them for selfish aims, of\nconsidering the individual and not the family convenience, and we\nremember with shame the self-pity which inevitably followed. But just as\nwe have learned to adjust the personal and family claims, and to find an\norderly development impossible without recognition of both, so perhaps\nwe are called upon now to make a second adjustment between the family\nand the social claim, in which neither shall lose and both be ennobled.\n\nThe attempt to bring about a healing compromise in which the two shall\nbe adjusted in proper relation is not an easy one. It is difficult to\ndistinguish between the outward act of him who in following one\nlegitimate claim has been led into the temporary violation of another,\nand the outward act of him who deliberately renounces a just claim and\nthrows aside all obligation for the sake of his own selfish and\nindividual development. The man, for instance, who deserts his family\nthat he may cultivate an artistic sensibility, or acquire what he\nconsiders more fulness of life for himself, must always arouse our\ncontempt. Breaking the marriage tie as Ibsen's \"Nora\" did, to obtain a\nlarger self-development, or holding to it as George Eliot's \"Romola\"\ndid, because of the larger claim of the state and society, must always\nremain two distinct paths. The collision of interests, each of which has\na real moral basis and a right to its own place in life, is bound to be\nmore or less tragic. It is the struggle between two claims, the\ndestruction of either of which would bring ruin to the ethical life.\nCuriously enough, it is almost exactly this contradiction which is the\ntragedy set forth by the Greek dramatist, who asserted that the gods who\nwatch over the sanctity of the family bond must yield to the higher\nclaims of the gods of the state. The failure to recognize the social\nclaim as legitimate causes the trouble; the suspicion constantly remains\nthat woman's public efforts are merely selfish and captious, and are not\ndirected to the general good. This suspicion will never be dissipated\nuntil parents, as well as daughters, feel the democratic impulse and\nrecognize the social claim.\n\nOur democracy is making inroads upon the family, the oldest of human\ninstitutions, and a claim is being advanced which in a certain sense is\nlarger than the family claim. The claim of the state in time of war has\nlong been recognized, so that in its name the family has given up sons\nand husbands and even the fathers of little children. If we can once see\nthe claims of society in any such light, if its misery and need can be\nmade clear and urged as an explicit claim, as the state urges its claims\nin the time of danger, then for the first time the daughter who desires\nto minister to that need will be recognized as acting conscientiously.\nThis recognition may easily come first through the emotions, and may be\nadmitted as a response to pity and mercy long before it is formulated\nand perceived by the intellect.\n\nThe family as well as the state we are all called upon to maintain as\nthe highest institutions which the race has evolved for its safeguard\nand protection. But merely to preserve these institutions is not enough.\nThere come periods of reconstruction, during which the task is laid upon\na passing generation, to enlarge the function and carry forward the\nideal of a long-established institution. There is no doubt that many\nwomen, consciously and unconsciously, are struggling with this task. The\nfamily, like every other element of human life, is susceptible of\nprogress, and from epoch to epoch its tendencies and aspirations are\nenlarged, although its duties can never be abrogated and its obligations\ncan never be cancelled. It is impossible to bring about the higher\ndevelopment by any self-assertion or breaking away of the individual\nwill. The new growth in the plant swelling against the sheath, which at\nthe same time imprisons and protects it, must still be the truest type\nof progress. The family in its entirety must be carried out into the\nlarger life. Its various members together must recognize and acknowledge\nthe validity of the social obligation. When this does not occur we have\na most flagrant example of the ill-adjustment and misery arising when an\nethical code is applied too rigorously and too conscientiously to\nconditions which are no longer the same as when the code was instituted,\nand for which it was never designed. We have all seen parental control\nand the family claim assert their authority in fields of effort which\nbelong to the adult judgment of the child and pertain to activity quite\noutside the family life. Probably the distinctively family tragedy of\nwhich we all catch glimpses now and then, is the assertion of this\nauthority through all the entanglements of wounded affection and\nmisunderstanding. We see parents and children acting from conscientious\nmotives and with the tenderest affection, yet bringing about a misery\nwhich can scarcely be hidden.\n\nSuch glimpses remind us of that tragedy enacted centuries ago in Assisi,\nwhen the eager young noble cast his very clothing at his father's feet,\ndramatically renouncing his filial allegiance, and formally subjecting\nthe narrow family claim to the wider and more universal duty. All the\nconflict of tragedy ensued which might have been averted, had the father\nrecognized the higher claim, and had he been willing to subordinate and\nadjust his own claim to it. The father considered his son disrespectful\nand hard-hearted, yet we know St. Francis to have been the most tender\nand loving of men, responsive to all possible ties, even to those of\ninanimate nature. We know that by his affections he freed the frozen\nlife of his time. The elements of tragedy lay in the narrowness of the\nfather's mind; in his lack of comprehension and his lack of sympathy\nwith the power which was moving his son, and which was but part of the\nreligious revival which swept Europe from end to end in the early part\nof the thirteenth century; the same power which built the cathedrals of\nthe North, and produced the saints and sages of the South. But the\nfather's situation was nevertheless genuine; he felt his heart sore and\nangry, and his dignity covered with disrespect. He could not, indeed,\nhave felt otherwise, unless he had been touched by the fire of the same\nrevival, and lifted out of and away from the contemplation of himself\nand his narrower claim. It is another proof that the notion of a larger\nobligation can only come through the response to an enlarged interest\nin life and in the social movements around us.\n\nThe grown-up son has so long been considered a citizen with well-defined\nduties and a need of \"making his way in the world,\" that the family\nclaim is urged much less strenuously in his case, and as a matter of\nauthority, it ceases gradually to be made at all. In the case of the\ngrown-up daughter, however, who is under no necessity of earning a\nliving, and who has no strong artistic bent, taking her to Paris to\nstudy painting or to Germany to study music, the years immediately\nfollowing her graduation from college are too often filled with a\nrestlessness and unhappiness which might be avoided by a little clear\nthinking, and by an adaptation of our code of family ethics to modern\nconditions.\n\nIt is always difficult for the family to regard the daughter otherwise\nthan as a family possession. From her babyhood she has been the charm\nand grace of the household, and it is hard to think of her as an\nintegral part of the social order, hard to believe that she has duties\noutside of the family, to the state and to society in the larger sense.\nThis assumption that the daughter is solely an inspiration and\nrefinement to the family itself and its own immediate circle, that her\ndelicacy and polish are but outward symbols of her father's protection\nand prosperity, worked very smoothly for the most part so long as her\neducation was in line with it. When there was absolutely no recognition\nof the entity of woman's life beyond the family, when the outside claims\nupon her were still wholly unrecognized, the situation was simple, and\nthe finishing school harmoniously and elegantly answered all\nrequirements. She was fitted to grace the fireside and to add lustre to\nthat social circle which her parents selected for her. But this family\nassumption has been notably broken into, and educational ideas no longer\nfit it. Modern education recognizes woman quite apart from family or\nsociety claims, and gives her the training which for many years has\nbeen deemed successful for highly developing a man's individuality and\nfreeing his powers for independent action. Perplexities often occur when\nthe daughter returns from college and finds that this recognition has\nbeen but partially accomplished. When she attempts to act upon the\nassumption of its accomplishment, she finds herself jarring upon ideals\nwhich are so entwined with filial piety, so rooted in the tenderest\naffections of which the human heart is capable, that both daughter and\nparents are shocked and startled when they discover what is happening,\nand they scarcely venture to analyze the situation. The ideal for the\neducation of woman has changed under the pressure of a new claim. The\nfamily has responded to the extent of granting the education, but they\nare jealous of the new claim and assert the family claim as over against\nit.\n\nThe modern woman finds herself educated to recognize a stress of social\nobligation which her family did not in the least anticipate when they\nsent her to college. She finds herself, in addition, under an impulse to\nact her part as a citizen of the world. She accepts her family\ninheritance with loyalty and affection, but she has entered into a wider\ninheritance as well, which, for lack of a better phrase, we call the\nsocial claim. This claim has been recognized for four years in her\ntraining, but after her return from college the family claim is again\nexclusively and strenuously asserted. The situation has all the\ndiscomfort of transition and compromise. The daughter finds a constant\nand totally unnecessary conflict between the social and the family\nclaims. In most cases the former is repressed and gives way to the\nfamily claim, because the latter is concrete and definitely asserted,\nwhile the social demand is vague and unformulated. In such instances the\ngirl quietly submits, but she feels wronged whenever she allows her mind\nto dwell upon the situation. She either hides her hurt, and splendid\nreserves of enthusiasm and capacity go to waste, or her zeal and\nemotions are turned inward, and the result is an unhappy woman, whose\nheart is consumed by vain regrets and desires.\n\nIf the college woman is not thus quietly reabsorbed, she is even\nreproached for her discontent. She is told to be devoted to her family,\ninspiring and responsive to her social circle, and to give the rest of\nher time to further self-improvement and enjoyment. She expects to do\nthis, and responds to these claims to the best of her ability, even\nheroically sometimes. But where is the larger life of which she has\ndreamed so long? That life which surrounds and completes the individual\nand family life? She has been taught that it is her duty to share this\nlife, and her highest privilege to extend it. This divergence between\nher self-centred existence and her best convictions becomes constantly\nmore apparent. But the situation is not even so simple as a conflict\nbetween her affections and her intellectual convictions, although even\nthat is tumultuous enough, also the emotional nature is divided against\nitself. The social claim is a demand upon the emotions as well as upon\nthe intellect, and in ignoring it she represses not only her convictions\nbut lowers her springs of vitality. Her life is full of contradictions.\nShe looks out into the world, longing that some demand be made upon her\npowers, for they are too untrained to furnish an initiative. When her\nhealth gives way under this strain, as it often does, her physician\ninvariably advises a rest. But to be put to bed and fed on milk is not\nwhat she requires. What she needs is simple, health-giving activity,\nwhich, involving the use of all her faculties, shall be a response to\nall the claims which she so keenly feels.\n\nIt is quite true that the family often resents her first attempts to be\npart of a life quite outside their own, because the college woman\nfrequently makes these first attempts most awkwardly; her faculties have\nnot been trained in the line of action. She lacks the ability to apply\nher knowledge and theories to life itself and to its complicated\nsituations. This is largely the fault of her training and of the\none-sidedness of educational methods. The colleges have long been full\nof the best ethical teaching, insisting that the good of the whole must\nultimately be the measure of effort, and that the individual can only\nsecure his own rights as he labors to secure those of others. But while\nthe teaching has included an ever-broadening range of obligation and has\ninsisted upon the recognition of the claims of human brotherhood, the\ntraining has been singularly individualistic; it has fostered ambitions\nfor personal distinction, and has trained the faculties almost\nexclusively in the direction of intellectual accumulation. Doubtless,\nwoman's education is at fault, in that it has failed to recognize\ncertain needs, and has failed to cultivate and guide the larger desires\nof which all generous young hearts are full.\n\nDuring the most formative years of life, it gives the young girl no\ncontact with the feebleness of childhood, the pathos of suffering, or\nthe needs of old age. It gathers together crude youth in contact only\nwith each other and with mature men and women who are there for the\npurpose of their mental direction. The tenderest promptings are bidden\nto bide their time. This could only be justifiable if a definite outlet\nwere provided when they leave college. Doubtless the need does not\ndiffer widely in men and women, but women not absorbed in professional\nor business life, in the years immediately following college, are baldly\nbrought face to face with the deficiencies of their training. Apparently\nevery obstacle is removed, and the college woman is at last free to\nbegin the active life, for which, during so many years, she has been\npreparing. But during this so-called preparation, her faculties have\nbeen trained solely for accumulation, and she has learned to utterly\ndistrust the finer impulses of her nature, which would naturally have\nconnected her with human interests outside of her family and her own\nimmediate social circle. All through school and college the young soul\ndreamed of self-sacrifice, of succor to the helpless and of tenderness\nto the unfortunate. We persistently distrust these desires, and, unless\nthey follow well-defined lines, we repress them with every device of\nconvention and caution.\n\nOne summer the writer went from a two weeks' residence in East London,\nwhere she had become sick and bewildered by the sights and sounds\nencountered there, directly to Switzerland. She found the beaten routes\nof travel filled with young English men and women who could walk many\nmiles a day, and who could climb peaks so inaccessible that the feats\nreceived honorable mention in Alpine journals,--a result which filled\ntheir families with joy and pride. These young people knew to a nicety\nthe proper diet and clothing which would best contribute toward\nendurance. Everything was very fine about them save their motive power.\nThe writer does not refer to the hard-worked men and women who were\ntaking a vacation, but to the leisured young people, to whom this period\nwas the most serious of the year, and filled with the most strenuous\nexertion. They did not, of course, thoroughly enjoy it, for we are too\ncomplicated to be content with mere exercise. Civilization has bound us\ntoo closely with our brethren for any one of us to be long happy in the\ncultivation of mere individual force or in the accumulation of mere\nmuscular energy.\n\nWith Whitechapel constantly in mind, it was difficult not to advise\nthese young people to use some of this muscular energy of which they\nwere so proud, in cleaning neglected alleys and paving soggy streets.\nTheir stores of enthusiasm might stir to energy the listless men and\nwomen of East London and utilize latent social forces. The exercise\nwould be quite as good, the need of endurance as great, the care for\nproper dress and food as important; but the motives for action would be\nturned from selfish ones into social ones. Such an appeal would\ndoubtless be met with a certain response from the young people, but\nwould never be countenanced by their families for an instant.\n\nFortunately a beginning has been made in another direction, and a few\nparents have already begun to consider even their little children in\nrelation to society as well as to the family. The young mothers who\nattend \"Child Study\" classes have a larger notion of parenthood and\nexpect given characteristics from their children, at certain ages and\nunder certain conditions. They quite calmly watch the various attempts\nof a child to assert his individuality, which so often takes the form of\nopposition to the wishes of the family and to the rule of the household.\nThey recognize as acting under the same law of development the little\nchild of three who persistently runs away and pretends not to hear his\nmother's voice, the boy of ten who violently, although temporarily,\nresents control of any sort, and the grown-up son who, by an\nindividualized and trained personality, is drawn into pursuits and\ninterests quite alien to those of his family.\n\nThis attempt to take the parental relation somewhat away from mere\npersonal experience, as well as the increasing tendency of parents to\nshare their children's pursuits and interests, will doubtless finally\nresult in a better understanding of the social obligation. The\nunderstanding, which results from identity of interests, would seem to\nconfirm the conviction that in the complicated life of to-day there is\nno education so admirable as that education which comes from\nparticipation in the constant trend of events. There is no doubt that\nmost of the misunderstandings of life are due to partial intelligence,\nbecause our experiences have been so unlike that we cannot comprehend\neach other. The old difficulties incident to the clash of two codes of\nmorals must drop away, as the experiences of various members of the\nfamily become larger and more identical.\n\nAt the present moment, however, many of those difficulties still exist\nand may be seen all about us. In order to illustrate the situation\nbaldly, and at the same time to put it dramatically, it may be well to\ntake an instance concerning which we have no personal feeling. The\ntragedy of King Lear has been selected, although we have been accustomed\nso long to give him our sympathy as the victim of the ingratitude of his\ntwo older daughters, and of the apparent coldness of Cordelia, that we\nhave not sufficiently considered the weakness of his fatherhood,\nrevealed by the fact that he should get himself into so entangled and\nunhappy a relation to all of his children."}

He had become a contractor, first\nfor little things, such as half a mile or so of a railway embankment, or three or four canal\nbridges, and then a contractor for great things, such as Government hospitals, locks, docks,\nand quays, and had latterly had in his hands the making of whole lines of railway.\n\nHe had been occasionally in partnership with one man for one thing, and then with another for\nanother; but had, on the whole, kept his interests to himself, and now at the time of our story,\nhe was a very rich man.\n\nAnd he had acquired more than wealth. There had been a time when the Government wanted the\nimmediate performance of some extraordinary piece of work, and Roger Scatcherd had been the\nman to do it. There had been some extremely necessary bit of a railway to be made in half the\ntime that such work would properly demand, some speculation to be incurred requiring great\nmeans and courage as well, and Roger Scatcherd had been found to be the man for the time. He\nwas then elevated for the moment to the dizzy pinnacle of a newspaper hero, and became one\nof those \"whom the king delighteth to honour.\" He went up one day to kiss Her Majesty's hand,\nand come down to his new grand house at Boxall Hill, Sir Roger Scatcherd, Bart.\n\n\"And now, my lady,\" said he, when he explained to his wife the high state to which she had\nbeen called by his exertions and the Queen's prerogative, \"let's have a bit of dinner, and\na drop of som'at hot.\" Now the drop of som'at hot signified a dose of alcohol sufficient to\nsend three ordinary men very drunk to bed.\n\nWhile conquering the world Roger Scatcherd had not conquered his old bad habits. Indeed, he\nwas the same man at all points that he had been when formerly seen about the streets of Barchester\nwith his stone-mason's apron tucked up round his waist. The apron he had abandoned, but not\nthe heavy prominent thoughtful brow, with the wildly flashing eye beneath it. He was still\nthe same good companion, and still also the same hard-working hero. In this only had he changed,\nthat now he would work, and some said equally well, whether he were drunk or sober. Those who\nwere mostly inclined to make a miracle of him--and there was a school of worshippers ready\nto adore him as their idea of a divine, superhuman, miracle-moving, inspired prophet--declared\nthat his wondrous work was best done, his calculations most quickly and most truly made, that\nhe saw with most accurate eye into the far-distant balance of profit and loss, when he was\nunder the influence of the rosy god. To these worshippers his breakings-out, as his periods\nof intemperance were called in his own set, were his moments of peculiar inspiration--his divine\nfrenzies, in which he communicated most closely with those deities who preside over trade transactions;\nhis Eleusinian mysteries, to approach him in which was permitted only to a few of the most\nfavoured.\n\n\"Scatcherd has been drunk this week past,\" they would say one to another, when the moment came\nat which it was to be decided whose offer should be accepted for constructing a harbour to\nhold all the commerce of Lancashire, or to make a railway from Bombay to Canton. \"Scatcherd\nhas been drunk this week past; I am told that he has taken over three gallons of brandy.\" And\nthen they felt sure that none but Scatcherd would be called upon to construct the dock or make\nthe railway.\n\nBut be this as it may, be it true or false that Sir Roger was most efficacious when in his\ncups, there can be no doubt that he could not wallow for a week in brandy, six or seven times\nevery year, without in a great measure injuring, and permanently injuring, the outward man.\nWhatever immediate effect such symposiums might have on the inner mind--symposiums indeed they\nwere not; posiums I will call them, if I may be allowed; for in latter life, when he drank\nheavily, he drank alone--however little for evil, or however much for good the working of his\nbrain might be affected, his body suffered greatly. It was not that he became feeble or emaciated,\nold-looking or inactive, that his hand shook, or that his eye was watery; but that in the moments\nof his intemperance his life was often not worth a day's purchase. The frame which God had\ngiven to him was powerful beyond the power of ordinary men; powerful to act in spite of these\nviolent perturbations; powerful to repress and conquer the qualms and headaches and inward\nsicknesses to which the votaries of Bacchus are ordinarily subject; but this power was not\nwithout its limit. If encroached on too far, it would break and fall and come asunder, and\nthen the strong man would at once become a corpse.\n\nScatcherd had but one friend in the world. And, indeed, this friend was no friend in the ordinary\nacceptance of the word. He neither ate with him nor drank with him, nor even frequently talked\nwith him. Their pursuits in life were wide asunder. Their tastes were all different. The society\nin which each moved very seldom came together. Scatcherd had nothing in unison with this solitary\nfriend; but he trusted him, and he trusted no other living creature on God's earth.\n\nHe trusted this man; but even him he did not trust thoroughly; not at least as one friend should\ntrust another. He believed that this man would not rob him; would probably not lie to him;\nwould not endeavour to make money of him; would not count him up or speculate on him, and make\nout a balance of profit and loss; and, therefore, he determined to use him. But he put no trust\nwhatever in his friend's counsel, in his modes of thought; none in his theory, and none in\nhis practice. He disliked his friend's counsel, and, in fact, disliked his society, for his\nfriend was somewhat apt to speak to him in a manner approaching to severity. Now Roger Scatcherd\nhad done many things in the world, and made much money; whereas his friend had done but few\nthings, and made no money. It was not to be endured that the practical, efficient man should\nbe taken to task by the man who proved himself to be neither practical nor efficient; not to\nbe endured, certainly, by Roger Scatcherd, who looked on men of his own class as the men of\nthe day, and on himself as by no means the least among them.\n\nThe friend was our friend Dr Thorne.\n\nThe doctor's first acquaintance with Scatcherd has been already explained. He was necessarily\nthrown into communication with the man at the time of the trial, and Scatcherd then had not\nonly sufficient sense, but sufficient feeling also to know that the doctor behaved very well.\nThis communication had in different ways been kept up between them. Soon after the trial Scatcherd\nhad begun to rise, and his first savings had been entrusted to the doctor's care. This had\nbeen the beginning of a pecuniary connexion which had never wholly ceased, and which had led\nto the purchase of Boxall Hill, and to the loan of large sums of money to the squire.\n\nIn another way also there had been a close alliance between them, and one not always of a very\npleasant description. The doctor was, and long had been, Sir Roger's medical attendant, and,\nin his unceasing attempts to rescue the drunkard from the fate which was so much to be dreaded,\nhe not unfrequently was driven into a quarrel with his patient.\n\nOne thing further must be told of Sir Roger. In politics he was as violent a Radical as ever,\nand was very anxious to obtain a position in which he could bring his violence to bear. With\nthis view he was about to contest his native borough of Barchester, in the hope of being returned\nin opposition to the de Courcy candidate; and with this object he had now come down to Boxall Hill.\n\nNor were his claims to sit for Barchester such as could be despised. If money were to be of\navail, he had plenty of it, and was prepared to spend it; whereas, rumour said that Mr Moffat\nwas equally determined to do nothing so foolish. Then again, Sir Roger had a sort of rough\neloquence, and was able to address the men of Barchester in language that would come home to\ntheir hearts, in words that would endear him to one party while they made him offensively odious\nto the other; but Mr Moffat could make neither friends nor enemies by his eloquence. The Barchester\nroughs called him a dumb dog that could not bark, and sometimes sarcastically added that neither\ncould he bite. The de Courcy interest, however, was at his back, and he had also the advantage\nof possession. Sir Roger, therefore, knew that the battle was not to be won without a struggle.\n\nDr Thorne got safely back from Silverbridge that evening, and found Mary waiting to give him\nhis tea. He had been called there to a consultation with Dr Century, that amiable old gentleman\nhaving so far fallen away from the high Fillgrave tenets as to consent to the occasional endurance\nof such degradation.\n\nThe next morning he breakfasted early, and, having mounted his strong iron-grey cob, started\nfor Boxall Hill. Not only had he there to negotiate the squire's further loan, but also to\nexercise his medical skill. Sir Roger having been declared contractor for cutting a canal from\nsea to sea, through the Isthmus of Panama, had been making a week of it; and the result was\nthat Lady Scatcherd had written rather peremptorily to her husband's medical friend.\n\nThe doctor consequently trotted off to Boxall Hill on his iron-grey cob. Among his other merits\nwas that of being a good horseman, and he did much of his work on horseback. The fact that\nhe occasionally took a day with the East Barsetshires, and that when he did so he thoroughly\nenjoyed it, had probably not failed to add something to the strength of the squire's friendship.\n\n\"Well, my lady, how is he? Not much the matter, I hope?\" said the doctor, as he shook hands\nwith the titled mistress of Boxall Hill in a small breakfast-parlour in the rear of the house.\nThe show-rooms of Boxall Hill were furnished most magnificently, but they were set apart for\ncompany; and as the company never came--seeing that they were never invited--the grand rooms\nand the grand furniture were not of much material use to Lady Scatcherd.\n\n\"Indeed then, doctor, he's just bad enough,\" said her ladyship, not in a very happy tone of\nvoice; \"just bad enough. There's been some'at at the back of his head, rapping, and rapping,\nand rapping; and if you don't do something, I'm thinking it will rap him too hard yet.\"\n\n\"Is he in bed?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, he is in bed; for when he was first took he couldn't very well help hisself, so\nwe put him to bed. And then, he don't seem to be quite right yet about the legs, so he hasn't\ngot up; but he's got that Winterbones with him to write for him, and when Winterbones is there,\nScatcherd might as well be up for any good that bed'll do him.\"\n\nMr Winterbones was confidential clerk to Sir Roger. That is to say, he was a writing-machine\nof which Sir Roger made use to do certain work which could not well be adjusted without some\ncontrivance."}

That\nrow of them must be the nearest that nature has ever come to counterfeiting a colonnade. These\ntrees are all the same height, say sixty feet; the trunks as gray as granite, with a very gradual\nand perfect taper; without sign of branch or knot or flaw; the surface not looking like bark,\nbut like granite that has been dressed and not polished.  Thus all the way up the diminishing\nshaft for fifty feet; then it begins to take the appearance of being closely wrapped, spool-fashion,\nwith gray cord, or of having been turned in a lathe.

{"ID": 78, "text": "\nCHAPTER XI\n\nCANNES\n\nOf one-half of Tarascon the prince whom Tartarin met in Algiers displayed an astonishingly\ndetailed knowledge.  Concerning the rest of the town he was as astonishingly noncommittal.\nWhen it leaked out that the prince had been in the Tarascon jail long enough to become familiar\nwith what could be seen from one window, Tartarin understood his limitation.  My picture of\nCannes is as indelible as the prince's picture of Tarascon.  For most of my Riviera days were\nspent in a villa across the Golfe de la Napoule from Cannes.  Not infrequently our baby Hope\ngave us the privilege of seeing Cannes by sunrise.  We ate and worked on a terrace below our\nbedroom windows.  Every evening we watched Cannes disappear or become fairyland in the moonlight.\n\nWhat we saw from the Villa \u00c9toile was the Golfe de la Napoule from the Pointe de l'Esquillon\nto the Cap de la Croisette.  The Corniche de l'Est\u00e9rel rounded the Esquillon and came down\nto sea level at Th\u00e9oule through a forest of pines.  It passed our villa.  The curve of the\ngulf between us and Cannes was only seven miles.  First came La Napoule, above whose old tower\non the sea rose a hill crowned with the ruins of a chapel.  A viaduct with narrow arches carried\nthe railway across the last ravine of the Est\u00e9rel.  In the plain, between two little rivers,\nthe Siagne and the Riou, was a grove of umbrella pines.  Here began the Boulevard Jean Hibert,\nprotected by a sea-wall in concrete, leading into Cannes.  The town of Cannes, flanked on the\nleft by Mont Chevalier and on the right by La Croisette, displayed a solid mass of hotels on\nthe water front.  Red-roofed villas climbed to Le Cannet and La Californie, elbowing each other\nin the town and scattering in the suburbs until the upper villas were almost lost in foliage.\nBehind were the Maritime Alps.  Not far beyond La Croisette, the Cap d'Antibes jutted out into\nthe sea.  At night the lighthouses of Cannes and Antibes flashed alternately red and green,\nand between them Cannes sparkled.  Inland to the left of Cannes were Mougins on a hill and\nGrasse above on the mountain side.  Occasional trails of smoke marked the main line of the\nrailway along the coast and the branch line from Cannes to Grasse.  In the sea lay the Iles\nde L\u00e9rins, Sainte-Marguerite almost touching the point of La Croisette.\n\n[Illustration: \"La Napoule, above whose tower on the sea rose a hill crowned with the ruins\nof a chapel.  Behind were the Maritime Alps.\"]\n\nBut unlike the Prince, we did have a chance to see Cannes at other angles.  Cannes was the\nmetropolis to which we went hopefully to hire cooks, find amusement, and buy food and drink.\nTh\u00e9oule had neither stores nor caf\u00e9s, and after the Artist came we were glad to vary the monotony\nof suburban life.  It is always that way with city folk.  How wonderful the quiet, how delightful\nthe seclusion of the \"real country\"!  But after a few weeks, while you may hate yourself for\nwanting noise and lights, while you may still affect to despise the herding instinct, you find\nyourself quite willing to commune with nature a little less intimately than in the first enthusiastic\ndays of your escape from the whirl and the turmoil of your accustomed atmosphere.  Not that\nCannes is ever exactly \"whirl and turmoil;\" but you could have tea at Rumpelmayer's, you could\ndance and listen to music and see shows at the Casino, and you could look in shop windows.\nOn the terrace of the Villa \u00c9toile we thanked God that we were out in the country, and we loved\nour walks on the Corniche road and back into the Est\u00e9rel.  But it was a comfort to have Cannes\nso near!  We were not dependent upon the twice-a-day _omnibus_ train, which made all the stops\nbetween Marseilles and Nice.  An hour and a half of brisker walking than one would have cared\nto indulge in farther east on the Riviera took us to Cannes, and the _cochers_ were always\nreasonable about driving out to Th\u00e9oule in the evening.\n\nFrom our villa to La Napoule we were still in the Est\u00e9rel.  Then we crossed the mouth of the\nSiagne by a bridge, and came down to the sea on the Boulevard Jean Hibert.  Between the mouth\nof the Siagne and Mont Chevalier are the original villas of Cannes and the hotels of the Second\nEmpire.  Here Lord Brougham built the Villa Eleonore Louise in 1834, when Cannes was a fishing\nvillage, not better known than any other hamlet along the coast.  Here are the Ch\u00e2teau Vallombrosa\n(now the H\u00f4tel du Pare), the Villa Larochefoucauld and the Villa Rothschild, whose unrivaled\ngardens are shut off by high walls and shrubbery.  They are well worth a visit: but you must\nknow when and how to get into them.  As you near Mont Chevalier, the sea wall, no longer needed\nto protect the railway (which for a couple of miles had to run right on the sea to avoid the\ngrounds and villas laid out before it was dreamed of), recedes for a few hundred feet and leaves\na beach.\n\nOn Mont Chevalier is the Old Town, grouped around a ruined castle and an eleventh-century tower.\nThe parish church is of the thirteenth century.  The buildings on the quay below, facing the\nport, are of the middle of the nineteenth century.  But they look much older.  For they were\nbuilt by townspeople, and serve the needs of the small portion of the population which would\nbe living in Cannes if it were not a fashionable watering place.  Despite its marvelous growth,\nNice has always maintained a life and industries apart from tourists and residents of the leisure\nclass.  Cannes, on the other hand, with the exception of the little Quartier du Suquet, is\na watering place.  It needs Mont Chevalier, as Monte Carlo needs Monaco, to make us realize\nthat Cannes existed before this spot was taken up and developed by French and British nobility.\nThe square tower and the cluster of buildings around it, the hotels and restaurants of fishermen\non the Quai Saint Pierre, dominate the port.  This bit out of the past, and of another world\nin the present, is at the end of the vista as one walks along the Promenade de la Croisette:\nand the Boulevard Jean Hibert runs right into it.  The touch of antiquity would otherwise be\nlacking, and the Artist would scarcely have considered it worth his while to take his kit when\nwe went to Cannes.\n\nThe port is formed by a breakwater extending out from the point of Mont Chevalier, with a jetty\nopposite.  Except for the fishermen, who are strong individualists and sell their catch right\nfrom their boat, the harbor's business is in keeping with the city's business.  Its shipping\nconsists of pleasure craft.  Among the yachts whose home is Cannes one used to see the _Lysistrata_\nof Commodore James Gordon Bennett.  How many times have I received irate messages and the other\nkind, too, both alike for my own good, sent from that vessel!  In the garden of his beautiful\nhome at Beaulieu, between Villefranche and Monaco, the Commodore told me of the offer he had\nreceived from the Russian Government for this famous yacht.  Not many months after the _Lysistrata_\ndisappeared from its anchorage at Cannes, the man who had been the reason--and means--of Riviera\nvisits to more journalists than myself died at Beaulieu.\n\nOnly on the side of Mont Chevalier has the harbor a quay.  The inner side is bordered by the\nAll\u00e9es de la Libert\u00e9, a huge rectangle with rows of old trees under which the flower market\nis held every morning. At the Old Town end is the H\u00f4tel de Ville and at the east end the Casino.\nRunning out seaward from beside the Casino is the Jet\u00e9e Albert Edouard.  To its very end the\njetty is paved, and when a stiff sea wind is blowing you can drink in the spray to your heart's\ncontent.  Behind the Casino is a generous beach.  This is one great advantage of Cannes over\nNice, where instead of sand you have gravel and pebbles.  The Riviera is largely deserted before\nthe bathing season sets in, but one does miss the sand.  At Cannes kiddies are not deprived\nof pails and shovels and grownups can stretch out their blankets and plant their umbrellas.\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette runs along the sea from the Casino to the Restaurant de la R\u00e9serve\non La Croisette.  The difference between the Promenade de la Croisette and the Promenade des\nAnglais was summed up by an English friend of mine in five words.  \"More go-carts and less\ndogs,\" he said.  \"More wives and less _cocottes_,\" the Artist put it. Of course there are some\nchildren at Nice and some _cocottes_ at Cannes.  And where fashion reigns the difference between\n_mondaine_ and _demi-mondaine_ is unfortunately not always apparent.  Gold frequently glitters.\nBut Cannes is less garish than Nice in buildings and in people.\n\nDoubling the Cap de la Croisette, we are in the Golfe Juan, with the Cap d'Antibes beyond.\nHere Napoleon, fearing his possible reception at Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, landed on his return from Elba.\nA column marks the spot.  Bound for the final test of arms at Waterloo, Napoleon little dreamed\nthat twenty years later his English foes would begin to make a peaceable conquest of this coast,\nand that within a hundred years French and English would be fighting side by side on French\nsoil against the Germans.  How much did the Englishman's love of the Riviera have to do with\nthe Entente Cordiale?  What part did the Riviera play in the Franco-Russian Alliance?  British\nand Russian sovereigns always showed as passionate a fondness for this corner of France as\ntheir subjects.  There were even English and Russian churches at Cannes and Nice.  Men who\nplayed a vital part in forming political alliances were regular visitors to the Riviera.  At\nthe beginning of the Promenade de la Croisette, only three miles from the Napoleon column,\nstands Puech's remarkable statue of Edward VII, who spoke French with a German accent, but\nwho never concealed his preference for France over the land of his ancestors.\n\nOne charm of Cannes is the feeling one has of not being crowded.  At Nice and along the eastern\nRiviera hotels and villas jostle each other. Around Cannes the gardens are more important than\nthe buildings. Striking straight inland from the Casino past the railway station, the broad\nBoulevard Carnot gradually ascends to Le Cannet.  This is the only straight road out of Cannes.\nAll the other roads wind and turn, bringing you constantly around unexpected corners until\nyou have lost your sense of direction.  Branches of trees stick out over garden walls overhung\nwith vines.  Many of the largest hotels can be reached only by these _chemins_.  You realize\nthat the city has grown haphazard, and that no methodical city architect was allowed to make\nboulevards and streets that would disturb the seclusion of the villa-builders, who plotted\nout their grounds with never a thought of those who might later build higher up.  So roads\nskirted properties.  The result does not commend itself to those who are in a hurry.  But it\ngives suburban Cannes an aspect unique on the Riviera.  Many of the hotels thus hidden away\nare built on private estates, and if you want to get to them you have to follow all the curves.\n\nThe labyrinthine approach adds greatly to the delight of a climb to La Californie.  If you\ngo by carriage, unless you have a map, you are tempted to feel that the _cocher_ is taking\na roundabout route to justify the high price he asked you.  But if you go afoot--and without\na map--you may find yourself back at the point of departure before you know it.  But however\nextended your wanderings, the beauty of the roads is ample compensation, and when you reach\nat last the Square du Splendide-Panorama, nearly eight hundred feet above the city, you are\nrewarded by a view of mountains and sea, from Nice to Cap Roux, which makes you say once more--as\nyou have so often done in Riviera explorations--\"This is the best!\"\n\nAfter lunch at the observatory we decided to walk on to Vallauris and look up our friend of\nAntibes at the pottery.  A _cocher_ without a fare persuaded us to visit the aqueduct at Clausonne\nen route to Vallauris.  He painted the glories of the scenery and of Roman masonry. \"You will\nnever regret listening to me,\" he urged.  We followed the wave of his hand, and climbed meekly\naboard, although at lunch we had been carrying on an antiphonal hymn of praise to the pleasure\nand benefit of shanks' mare.\n\nWe did not regret abandoning our walk.  I managed to get the Artist by the Chapelle de Saint-Antoine\non the Col de Vallauris and to limit him to a hasty _croquis_ of the Clausonne Aqueduct.  We\nwere out for pleasure, with no thought of articles.  When you feel that you are going to have\nto turn your adventures to a practical use, it does take away from the sense of relaxation\nthat a writer like anyone else craves for on his day off.  On the road to Vallauris we were\nmore struck by the heather than any other form of vegetation.  The mountains and hills were\ncovered with it, and whatever else we saw, heather was always in the picture on the hills and\nmimosa along the roadside.  From the roots of transplanted Mediterranean heather--and not from\nbriar--are made what we call briarwood pipes.  When a salesman assures you that the pipe he\noffers is \"genuine briar,\" if it really was briar, you would think it wasn't.  When names have\nbecome trademarks, we have to persist in their misuse.\n\nVallauris was called the golden valley (_vallis aurea_) because of the pottery the Romans discovered\nthe natives making from the fine clay of the banks of the little stream that runs into the\nGolfe Juan.  For twenty centuries the inhabitants of Vallauris have found no reason to change\ntheir _m\u00e9tier_.  They are still making dishes and vases and statuettes, and there is still\nplenty of clay.  Moreover, modern methods have not found a substitute either for the potter\nat his wheel or for the little ovens of limited capacity when it comes to turning out work\nthat is flawless and bears the stamp of individuality.  We can manufacture almost everything\nen masse and in series except pottery. Joseph-Marie was not in evidence at Vallauris: but we\nfound the potters glad to show us their work, seemingly for the pride they had in it.  Of course\nyou did have a chance to buy: but salesmanship was not obtrusive.\n\nThe great industry of Cannes is fresh cut flowers.  The flower market of a morning in the All\u00e9es\nde la Libert\u00e9 is richer in variety than that of Nice.  There is less charm, however, in the\nsellers.  In Nice you simply cannot help buying what is offered you.  Pretty faces and soft\npleading voices draw the money from your pocket.  You look from the flowers to those who offer\nthem: and then you buy the flowers.  At Cannes, on the other hand, you ask yourself first what\nin the world you are going to do with them after you have them.  Perhaps this difference in\nyour mood is the reason of the enormous industry that has been developed in Cannes.  You are\nnot asked to buy flowers because a seller wants you to and is able to lure you with a smile.\nYou are told that here is the unique chance to send your friends in Paris and London a bit\nof the springtime fragrance of the Riviera.\n\n\"Three francs, five francs, ten francs, _monsieur_, and tomorrow morning in Paris or tomorrow\nevening in London the postman will deliver the flowers to your friend.\"\n\nPen and ink, cards, gummed labels or tags are put under your nose.  You are shown the little\nreed baskets, in rectangular form, that will carry your gift.  If your Paris or London friend\nknows Latin, and thinks a minute, he will realize that Cannes is living up to her name in thus\nutilizing her reeds to send out over Europe an Easter greeting, jonquils, carnations, roses,\ngeraniums with the smell of lemons, orange blossoms, cassia, jessamine, lilacs, violets and mimosa.\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nMOUGINS\n\nWe were about to enter the Casino at Cannes.  The coin had been flipped to decide which of\nus should pay, and we were starting up the steps when a yell and a clatter of horses' hoofs\nmade us look around.  A victoria was bearing down upon us.  The _cocher_ was waving his whip\nin our direction.  We recognized the man who had driven us to Grasse.\n\n\"A superb afternoon,\" he explained, \"and Mougins is only twelve kilometers away.  With Mougins\nat twelve kilometers, it is incredible to think that you would be spending an afternoon like\nthis in the Casino.  I would surely be lacking in my duty--\"\n\n\"What is Mougins?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"All that is beautiful,\" explained the _cocher_ enthusiastically.  \"A city on a hill.  A glorious\nview.\"\n\n\"That settles it,\" said the Artist, turning away.  \"Every city is on a hill, and all views\nare glorious.\"\n\n\"But Mougins is different,\" insisted the _cocher_, \"and the view is different.  Besides, the\nwine is unique.  It is sparkling, and can be taken at five o'clock with little cakes.  There\nare roads you have not seen, and pretty girls at work in the rose fields.  We shall drive slowly.\"\n\nThere had been much wandering during the past fortnight and we were ready for a quiet afternoon\nat the Casino.  But we allowed ourselves to be persuaded.  The Casino was always there, and\nwe had never heard of _vin mousseux_ on the Riviera.  Baedeker, as if in duty bound to miss\nnothing, records the existence of Mougins, three kilometers east of the Cannes-Grasse road\nafter you pass the ten-kilometer stone on the way to Grasse--then gives the next town.  Mougins\nis not starred, and nothing around Mougins is starred.  Was not that a reason for going there?\n\nEnglish royalty used to come to Cannes, and every season more middle class Britishers woke\nup to the fact that it would be pleasant to write home to one's friends from Cannes.  H\u00f4tels\nand villas increased rapidly.  When English royalty went elsewhere, Russian Grand Dukes and\nBalkan princelings saved the day for the snobs.  Consequently, the town has spread annoyingly\ninto the country.  A row of hotels faces the sea, and on side streets are less pretentious\nhotels, invariably advertised as a minute's walk from the sea.  A mile inland is another quarter\nof fashionable hotels for those whom the splashing of the waves makes nervous.  Then the interminable\nsuburbs of villas and _pensions_ commence.\n\nWhen city people seek a change of climate, they do not always want a change of environment.\nThey are intent upon living the same life as at home, upon following the same round of amusements.\nThey cannot be happy without their comforts and conveniences, and this means the impossibility\nof getting away from streets and buildings and noises and crowds."}
{"ID": 1009, "text": "There may, however, be a remnant of readers willing\nto accompany me, and for their sakes I proceed. A hundred compounds might be named which, like\nthe ammonia, are transparent to light, but more or less opaque--often, indeed, intensely opaque--to\nthe rays of heat from obscure sources. Now the difference between these latter rays and the\nlight rays is purely a difference of period of vibration. The vibrations in the case of light\nare more rapid, and the ether waves which they produce are shorter, than in the case of obscure\nheat. Why, then, should the ultra-red waves be intercepted by bodies like ammonia, while the\nmore rapidly recurrent waves of the whole visible spectrum are allowed free transmission? The\nanswer I hold to be that, by the act of chemical combination, the vibrations of the constituent\natoms of the molecules are rendered so sluggish as to synchronize with the motions of the longer\nwaves. They resemble loaded piano strings, or slowly descending water jets, requiring notes\nof low pitch to set them in motion.\n\nThe influence of synchronism between the \"radiant\" and the \"absorbent\" is well shown by the\nbehavior of carbonic acid gas. To the complex emission from our heated stove, carbonic acid\nwould be one of the most transparent of gases. For such waves olefiant gas, for example, would\nvastly transcend it in absorbing power. But when we select a radiant with whose waves the atoms\nof carbonic acid are in accord, the case is entirely altered. Such a radiant is found in a\ncarbonic oxide flame, where the radiating body is really hot carbonic acid. To this special\nradiation carbonic acid is the most opaque of gases.\n\nAnd here we find ourselves face to face with a question of great delicacy and importance. Both\nas a radiator and as an absorber, carbonic acid is, in general, a feeble gas. It is beaten\nin this respect by chloride of methyl, ethylene, ammonia, sulphurous acid, nitrous oxide, and\nmarsh gas. Compared with some of these gases, its behavior, in fact, approaches that of elementary\nbodies. May it not help to explain their neutrality? The doctrine is now very generally accepted\nthat atoms of the same kind may, like atoms of different kinds, group themselves to molecules.\nAffinity exists between hydrogen and hydrogen and between chlorine and chlorine, as well as\nbetween hydrogen and chlorine. We have thus homogeneous molecules as well as heterogeneous\nmolecules, and the neutrality so strikingly exhibited by the elements may be due to a quality\nof which carbonic acid furnishes a partial illustration."}

{"ID": 16, "text": "Mrs. Bywank quickly responded to Rollo's question, saying that Miss Wych had indeed mentioned her intention to go out, although her mind could change suddenly at times. She expressed her delight in seeing Rollo again and offered him breakfast, inviting him to take his usual seat. Rollo acknowledged that Miss Wych always ended up in the right place, to which Mrs. Bywank let out a sigh and gazed at a small picture. She then proceeded to fill Rollo's cup, continuing their conversation by sharing that Miss Wych was adored by many, receiving compliments, flowers, and serenades. However, she also mentioned that Miss Wych viewed the world through her own eyes and that nobody could change that.\n\nRollo asked if Miss Wych shared her thoughts and plans with Mrs. Bywank, to which she replied that Miss Wych told her everything, from what dress she would wear to what she would do, and why her head was not turned despite all the attention she received. The old housekeeper was puzzled by this and wondered if handling so many hearts might change Miss Wych. Rollo went on to inform Mrs. Bywank that Mrs. Coles had returned and that she might cause mischief, to which Mrs. Bywank agreed, acknowledging that the world was not as simple as Miss Wych believed. Rollo assured her that he would be there to help if needed and that he wished she would call him if she had any doubts or concerns.\n\nMrs. Bywank hesitated, saying that she could not call him unless the conditions of the will were to be carried out. Rollo assured her that they would be carried out, and Mrs. Bywank was visibly relieved. She then shared that Miss Wych had been wanting to ride all summer, but Mr. Falkirk had never allowed her to do so, adding that she would rather ask Rollo than Mr. Falkirk for permission. Rollo stated that he was legally qualified to act and had made the requisite declarations in the presence of Mr. Falkirk and Dr. Maryland. He also mentioned that Miss Wych did not know about this and it was best that she did not for the time being.\n\nMrs. Bywank agreed, saying that Miss Wych disliked being questioned about her actions and always thought she had done something wrong. She recalled how Miss Wych used to cry over a word from Mr. Kennedy, but never did so for Mr. Falkirk. They ended their conversation as Mrs. Bywank called for some hot waffles and apologized for bringing up the subject.Mr. Rollo was not alarmed by the comment that nobody ever sees Wych Hazel. Instead, he responded with a playful expression that was difficult to define. It was not authoritative or arrogant, but it conveyed a message that he intended to be different from other men. He acknowledged the difficulty of Wych Hazel's situation and was glad that she had a good friend in both Mrs. Bywank and himself. Mrs. Bywank expressed her concerns about Miss Fisher, who she believed was trying to influence Wych Hazel's behavior and dress. \n\nSuddenly, Wych Hazel entered the room, feeling anxious about being seen by Mr. Rollo. However, he welcomed her calmly and helped her with breakfast. After some minor adjustments to the table setting, Wych Hazel teased Mr. Rollo about the jar of marmalade, which he had not finished.\"If only the bears had known where it was,\" Wych Hazel commented. She had noticed Mr. Falkirk's unusually irritable demeanor that morning and how it had affected everyone in the house. She had even engaged in a playful argument with Gotham over it, which resulted in her requesting Byo to bring her some fruit.\n\nBut to her disappointment, there was none to be had in the house except for a basket of a variety of fruits kept in her room, which she never ate. However, as she rummaged through the basket to set aside the fruits she liked, she stumbled upon a sealed note. Startled, she dropped it and retrieved only to read its mysterious contents.\n\nHastily placing the basket on the floor, she offered the fruits to Rollo who had been waiting patiently. As he washed his fingers, he perused the fruits before him and selected a bunch of grapes and apricots for Wych Hazel. \"Will you accept these from me?\" he asked. \"They are my own property, and are offered to you. Taste and see if they are as good as they ought to be.\"\n\nWych Hazel played along, taking a grape and declaring it \"quite good and not at all sour,\" while also making a sly comment at Mrs. Bywank. Their playful banter was interrupted when Dingee, the houseboy, brought in a card with a message. Wych Hazel was annoyed by the interruption and scribbled a \"No\" across the lines before sending him away.\n\nRollo found amusement in Wych Hazel's disciplinary tactics and even offered her a peach, which she accepted gratefully. They continued their playful conversation as General Merrick and Major Seaton arrived, causing Wych Hazel to flare up at the insinuation that she had not been clear about something the previous night. Nonetheless, she managed to reconnect with the fun and had a good laugh.Her laughter, clear and joyful, rang out as if there were no troubles in the world.\"That's one option,\" she said. Rollo chuckled, \"Sounds peaceful, but I'm not convinced. It might be too severe. What is your verdict from that statement?\" \"There is no appeal. I am a Mede and a Persian combined,\" Hazel replied. \"By the way, why don't you serve Mr. Rollo cream with his peaches and save me for another time?\" Rollo chimed in, \"She'll have to postpone me too. I have to go. Shall I pick you up at four o'clock? It's going to be too hot before then, and we have a long way to go.\" \n\nIn anticipation of her ride, Hazel visited Mr. Falkirk's study, where she proposed a few questions related to riding with Major Seaton and Mr. Rollo on Thursday and this afternoon, respectively. Mr. Falkirk did not object and the conversation veered to the availability of a horse. Hazel was not certain if her horse would arrive that afternoon, but Mr. Falkirk seemed unfazed, \"I suppose Rollo will see to that.\" \n\nWhen Hazel reached the front of Chickaree, a brown mare was waiting with a side saddle, and Rollo appeared to be the only one attending to the horses. Although Rollo's horse was new, it was lively and restless. Hazel raised a question, \"But was there nobody about the place to do that but Mr. Rollo?\" silently worrying about the unexpected turn of events. Soon, Rollo finished tending to both horses, and they were on their way.This man was a skilled equestrian, effortlessly moving with his horse in complete harmony. While others had varying levels of skill and comfort, he exuded a natural ease and grace. As they rode through the picturesque countryside, he showed off his brown mare's impressive qualities and even engaged in a thrilling run. The woman riding with him appreciated his skill and was smitten with his charm. However, as they approached the dark, dreary settlement of Morton Hollow, she expressed concern that his friend may live there. The dismal atmosphere only added to the tension of their journey."}

Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and\ndesire had come to meet it on the way.\n\n\"And what do you propose to do?\" said Lord Henry at last.\n\n\"I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act.  I\nhave not the slightest fear of the result.  You are certain to\nacknowledge her genius.  Then we must get her out of the Jew's hands.\nShe is bound to him for three years--at least for two years and eight\nmonths--from the present time.  I shall have to pay him something, of\ncourse.  When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and\nbring her out properly.  She will make the world as mad as she has made\nme.\"\n\n\"That would be impossible, my dear boy.\"\n\n\"Yes, she will.  She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in\nher, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it\nis personalities, not principles, that move the age.\"\n\n\"Well, what night shall we go?\"\n\n\"Let me see.  To-day is Tuesday.  Let us fix to-morrow. She plays\nJuliet to-morrow.\"\n\n\"All right.  The Bristol at eight o'clock; and I will get Basil.\"\n\n\"Not eight, Harry, please.  Half-past six.  We must be there before the\ncurtain rises.  You must see her in the first act, where she meets\nRomeo.\"\n\n\"Half-past six!  What an hour!  It will be like having a meat-tea, or\nreading an English novel.  It must be seven.  No gentleman dines before\nseven.  Shall you see Basil between this and then?  Or shall I write to\nhim?\"\n\n\"Dear Basil!  I have not laid eyes on him for a week.  It is rather\nhorrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful\nframe, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous\nof the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit\nthat I delight in it.  Perhaps you had better write to him.  I don't\nwant to see him alone.  He says things that annoy me.  He gives me good\nadvice.\"\n\nLord Henry smiled.  \"People are very fond of giving away what they need\nmost themselves.  It is what I call the depth of generosity.\"\n\n\"Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit\nof a Philistine.  Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered\nthat.\"\n\n\"Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his\nwork.  The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his\nprejudices, his principles, and his common sense.  The only artists I\nhave ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists.  Good\nartists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly\nuninteresting in what they are.  A great poet, a really great poet, is\nthe most unpoetical of all creatures.  But inferior poets are\nabsolutely fascinating.  The worse their rhymes are, the more\npicturesque they look.  The mere fact of having published a book of\nsecond-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible.  He lives the\npoetry that he cannot write.  The others write the poetry that they\ndare not realize.\"\n\n\"I wonder is that really so, Harry?\" said Dorian Gray, putting some\nperfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that\nstood on the table.  \"It must be, if you say it.  And now I am off.\nImogen is waiting for me.  Don't forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.\"\n\nAs he left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began\nto think.  Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as\nDorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused\nhim not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy.  He was pleased by\nit.  It made him a more interesting study.  He had been always\nenthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary\nsubject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no\nimport.  And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by\nvivisecting others.  Human life--that appeared to him the one thing\nworth investigating.  Compared to it there was nothing else of any\nvalue.  It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of\npain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass,\nnor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the\nimagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.  There\nwere poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken\nof them.  There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through\nthem if one sought to understand their nature.  And, yet, what a great\nreward one received!  How wonderful the whole world became to one!  To\nnote the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life\nof the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated,\nat what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at\ndiscord--there was a delight in that!  What matter what the cost was?\nOne could never pay too high a price for any sensation.\n\nHe was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his\nbrown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his, musical\nwords said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned\nto this white girl and bowed in worship before her.  To a large extent\nthe lad was his own creation.  He had made him premature.  That was\nsomething.  Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its\nsecrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were\nrevealed before the veil was drawn away.  Sometimes this was the effect\nof art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately\nwith the passions and the intellect.  But now and then a complex\npersonality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,\nin its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,\njust as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.\n\nYes, the lad was premature.  He was gathering his harvest while it was\nyet spring.  The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was\nbecoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him.  With his\nbeautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at.\nIt was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end.  He was like\none of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem\nto be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty,\nand whose wounds are like red roses.\n\nSoul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they were!  There was\nanimalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.\nThe senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade.  Who could\nsay where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began?\nHow shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!\nAnd yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various\nschools!  Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?  Or was the\nbody really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?  The separation of\nspirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter\nwas a mystery also.\n\nHe began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a\nscience that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.  As it\nwas, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.\nExperience was of no ethical value.  It was merely the name men gave to\ntheir mistakes.  Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of\nwarning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation\nof character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow\nand showed us what to avoid.  But there was no motive power in\nexperience.  It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.\nAll that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same\nas our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we\nwould do many times, and with joy.\n\nIt was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by\nwhich one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and\ncertainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to\npromise rich and fruitful results.  His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane\nwas a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.  There was no\ndoubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire\nfor new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex\npassion.  What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of\nboyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,\nchanged into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from\nsense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous.  It was the\npassions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most\nstrongly over us.  Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we\nwere conscious.  It often happened that when we thought we were\nexperimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.\n\nWhile Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the\ndoor, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for\ndinner.  He got up and looked out into the street.  The sunset had\nsmitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite.\nThe panes glowed like plates of heated metal.  The sky above was like a\nfaded rose.  He thought of his friend's young fiery-coloured life and\nwondered how it was all going to end.\n\nWhen he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a telegram\nlying on the hall table.  He opened it and found it was from Dorian\nGray.  It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl\nVane.\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\"Mother, Mother, I am so happy!\" whispered the girl, burying her face\nin the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to\nthe shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their\ndingy sitting-room contained.  \"I am so happy!\" she repeated, \"and you\nmust be happy, too!\"\n\nMrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her\ndaughter's head.  \"Happy!\" she echoed, \"I am only happy, Sibyl, when I\nsee you act.  You must not think of anything but your acting.  Mr.\nIsaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money.\"\n\nThe girl looked up and pouted.  \"Money, Mother?\" she cried, \"what does\nmoney matter?  Love is more than money.\"\n\n\"Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to\nget a proper outfit for James.  You must not forget that, Sibyl.  Fifty\npounds is a very large sum.  Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.\"\n\n\"He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,\"\nsaid the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.\n\n\"I don't know how we could manage without him,\" answered the elder\nwoman querulously.\n\nSibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed.  \"We don't want him any more,\nMother.  Prince Charming rules life for us now.\" Then she paused.  A\nrose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks.  Quick breath parted\nthe petals of her lips.  They trembled.  Some southern wind of passion\nswept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress.  \"I love\nhim,\" she said simply.\n\n\"Foolish child! foolish child!\" was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.\nThe waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the\nwords.\n\nThe girl laughed again.  The joy of a caged bird was in her voice.  Her\neyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a\nmoment, as though to hide their secret.  When they opened, the mist of\na dream had passed across them.\n\nThin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at\nprudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name\nof common sense.  She did not listen.  She was free in her prison of\npassion.  Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her.  She had called on\nmemory to remake him.  She had sent her soul to search for him, and it\nhad brought him back.  His kiss burned again upon her mouth.  Her\neyelids were warm with his breath.\n\nThen wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery.  This\nyoung man might be rich.  If so, marriage should be thought of.\nAgainst the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning.  The\narrows of craft shot by her.  She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.\n\nSuddenly she felt the need to speak.  The wordy silence troubled her.\n\"Mother, Mother,\" she cried, \"why does he love me so much?  I know why\nI love him.  I love him because he is like what love himself should be.\nBut what does he see in me?  I am not worthy of him.  And yet--why, I\ncannot tell--though I feel so much beneath him, I don't feel humble.  I\nfeel proud, terribly proud.  Mother, did you love my father as I love\nPrince Charming?\"\n\nThe elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her\ncheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain.  Sybil rushed\nto her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her.  \"Forgive me,\nMother.  I know it pains you to talk about our father.  But it only\npains you because you loved him so much.  Don't look so sad.  I am as\nhappy to-day as you were twenty years ago.  Ah! let me be happy for\never!\"\n\n\"My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love.  Besides,\nwhat do you know of this young man?  You don't even know his name.  The\nwhole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away\nto Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you\nshould have shown more consideration.  However, as I said before, if he\nis rich ...\"\n\n\"Ah!  Mother, Mother, let me be happy!\"\n\nMrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical\ngestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a\nstage-player, clasped her in her arms.  At this moment, the door opened\nand a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room.  He was\nthick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat\nclumsy in movement.  He was not so finely bred as his sister.  One\nwould hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between\nthem.  Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile.  She\nmentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience.  She felt sure\nthat the tableau was interesting.\n\n\"You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,\" said the\nlad with a good-natured grumble.\n\n\"Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim,\" she cried.  \"You are a\ndreadful old bear.\"  And she ran across the room and hugged him.\n\nJames Vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness.  \"I want you\nto come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.  I don't suppose I shall ever\nsee this horrid London again.  I am sure I don't want to.\"\n\n\"My son, don't say such dreadful things,\" murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up\na tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it.  She\nfelt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group.  It would\nhave increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.\n\n\"Why not, Mother?  I mean it.\"\n\n\"You pain me, my son.  I trust you will return from Australia in a\nposition of affluence.  I believe there is no society of any kind in\nthe Colonies--nothing that I would call society--so when you have made\nyour fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.\"\n\n\"Society!\" muttered the lad.  \"I don't want to know anything about\nthat.  I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the\nstage.  I hate it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jim!\" said Sibyl, laughing, \"how unkind of you!  But are you\nreally going for a walk with me?  That will be nice!  I was afraid you\nwere going to say good-bye to some of your friends--to Tom Hardy, who\ngave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for\nsmoking it.  It is very sweet of you to let me have your last\nafternoon.  Where shall we go?  Let us go to the park.\"\n\n\"I am too shabby,\" he answered, frowning.  \"Only swell people go to the\npark.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Jim,\" she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.\n\nHe hesitated for a moment.  \"Very well,\" he said at last, \"but don't be\ntoo long dressing.\"  She danced out of the door.  One could hear her\nsinging as she ran upstairs.  Her little feet pattered overhead.\n\nHe walked up and down the room two or three times.  Then he turned to\nthe still figure in the chair.  \"Mother, are my things ready?\" he asked.\n\n\"Quite ready, James,\" she answered, keeping her eyes on her work.  For\nsome months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this\nrough stern son of hers.  Her shallow secret nature was troubled when\ntheir eyes met.  She used to wonder if he suspected anything.  The\nsilence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.\nShe began to complain.  Women defend themselves by attacking, just as\nthey attack by sudden and strange surrenders.  \"I hope you will be\ncontented, James, with your sea-faring life,\" she said.  \"You must\nremember that it is your own choice.  You might have entered a\nsolicitor's office.  Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in\nthe country often dine with the best families.\"\n\n\"I hate offices, and I hate clerks,\" he replied.  \"But you are quite\nright.  I have chosen my own life.  All I say is, watch over Sibyl.\nDon't let her come to any harm.  Mother, you must watch over her.\"\n\n\"James, you really talk very strangely.  Of course I watch over Sibyl.\"\n\n\"I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to\ntalk to her.  Is that right?  What about that?\"\n\n\"You are speaking about things you don't understand, James.  In the\nprofession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying\nattention.  I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time.  That\nwas when acting was really understood.  As for Sibyl, I do not know at\npresent whether her attachment is serious or not.  But there is no\ndoubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman.  He is\nalways most polite to me.  Besides, he has the appearance of being\nrich, and the flowers he sends are lovely.\"\n\n\"You don't know his name, though,\" said the lad harshly.\n\n\"No,\" answered his mother with a placid expression in her face.  \"He\nhas not yet revealed his real name.  I think it is quite romantic of\nhim.  He is probably a member of the aristocracy.\"\n\nJames Vane bit his lip.  \"Watch over Sibyl, Mother,\" he cried, \"watch\nover her.\"\n\n\"My son, you distress me very much.  Sibyl is always under my special\ncare.  Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why\nshe should not contract an alliance with him.  I trust he is one of the\naristocracy.  He has all the appearance of it, I must say.  It might be\na most brilliant marriage for Sibyl.  They would make a charming\ncouple.  His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices\nthem.\"\n\nThe lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane\nwith his coarse fingers.  He had just turned round to say something\nwhen the door opened and Sibyl ran in.\n\n\"How serious you both are!\" she cried.  \"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he answered.  \"I suppose one must be serious sometimes.\nGood-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock. Everything is\npacked, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my son,\" she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.\n\nShe was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and\nthere was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.\n\n\"Kiss me, Mother,\" said the girl.  Her flowerlike lips touched the\nwithered cheek and warmed its frost.\n\n\"My child! my child!\" cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in\nsearch of an imaginary gallery.\n\n\"Come, Sibyl,\" said her brother impatiently.  He hated his mother's\naffectations.\n\nThey went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled\ndown the dreary Euston Road.  The passersby glanced in wonder at the\nsullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the\ncompany of such a graceful, refined-looking girl.  He was like a common\ngardener walking with a rose.\n\nJim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of\nsome stranger.  He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on\ngeniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace.  Sibyl,\nhowever, was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing.  Her\nlove was trembling in laughter on her lips.  She was thinking of Prince\nCharming, and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not\ntalk of him, but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to\nsail, about the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful\nheiress whose life he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted\nbushrangers.  For he was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or\nwhatever he was going to be.  Oh, no!  A sailor's existence was\ndreadful.  Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse,\nhump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts\ndown and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands!  He was to\nleave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain,\nand go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to\ncome across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had\never been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon\nguarded by six mounted policemen.  The bushrangers were to attack them\nthree times, and be defeated with immense slaughter.  Or, no.  He was\nnot to go to the gold-fields at all.  They were horrid places, where\nmen got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad\nlanguage.  He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he was\nriding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a\nrobber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her.  Of course,\nshe would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get\nmarried, and come home, and live in an immense house in London.  Yes,\nthere were delightful things in store for him.  But he must be very\ngood, and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly.  She was\nonly a year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life.  He\nmust be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his\nprayers each night before he went to sleep.  God was very good, and\nwould watch over him.  She would pray for him, too, and in a few years\nhe would come back quite rich and happy.\n\nThe lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer.  He was heart-sick\nat leaving home.\n\nYet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.\nInexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger\nof Sibyl's position.  This young dandy who was making love to her could\nmean her no good.  He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated\nhim through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,\nand which for that reason was all the more dominant within him.  He was\nconscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother's nature,\nand in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness.\nChildren begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge\nthem; sometimes they forgive them.\n\nHis mother!  He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that\nhe had brooded on for many months of silence.  A chance phrase that he\nhad heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears\none night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of\nhorrible thoughts.  He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a\nhunting-crop across his face.  His brows knit together into a wedgelike\nfurrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.\n\n\"You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,\" cried Sibyl, \"and I\nam making the most delightful plans for your future.  Do say something.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to say?\"\n\n\"Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,\" she answered,\nsmiling at him.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  \"You are more likely to forget me than I am\nto forget you, Sibyl.\"\n\nShe flushed.  \"What do you mean, Jim?\" she asked.\n\n\"You have a new friend, I hear.  Who is he?  Why have you not told me\nabout him?  He means you no good.\"\n\n\"Stop, Jim!\" she exclaimed.  \"You must not say anything against him.  I\nlove him.\"\n\n\"Why, you don't even know his name,\" answered the lad.  \"Who is he?  I\nhave a right to know.\"\n\n\"He is called Prince Charming.  Don't you like the name.  Oh! you silly\nboy! you should never forget it.  If you only saw him, you would think\nhim the most wonderful person in the world.  Some day you will meet\nhim--when you come back from Australia.  You will like him so much.\nEverybody likes him, and I ... love him.  I wish you could come to the\ntheatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet.\nOh! how I shall play it!  Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet!\nTo have him sitting there!  To play for his delight!  I am afraid I may\nfrighten the company, frighten or enthrall them."}

{"ID": 342, "text": " This,\nhowever, needed some interest with the great, which Harley or his\nfather never possessed.\n\nHis neighbour, Mr. Walton, having heard of this affair, generously\noffered his assistance to accomplish it.  He told him, that though\nhe had long been a stranger to courtiers, yet he believed there were\nsome of them who might pay regard to his recommendation; and that,\nif he thought it worth the while to take a London journey upon the\nbusiness, he would furnish him with a letter of introduction to a\nbaronet of his acquaintance, who had a great deal to say with the\nfirst lord of the treasury.\n\nWhen his friends heard of this offer, they pressed him with the\nutmost earnestness to accept of it.\n\nThey did not fail to enumerate the many advantages which a certain\ndegree of spirit and assurance gives a man who would make a figure\nin the world:  they repeated their instances of good fortune in\nothers, ascribed them all to a happy forwardness of disposition; and\nmade so copious a recital of the disadvantages which attend the\nopposite weakness, that a stranger, who had heard them, would have\nbeen led to imagine, that in the British code there was some\ndisqualifying statute against any citizen who should be convicted\nof--modesty.\n\nHarley, though he had no great relish for the attempt, yet could not\nresist the torrent of motives that assaulted him; and as he needed\nbut little preparation for his journey, a day, not very distant, was\nfixed for his departure.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--THE MAN OF FEELING IN LOVE\n\n\nThe day before that on which he set out, he went to take leave of\nMr. Walton.--We would conceal nothing;--there was another person of\nthe family to whom also the visit was intended, on whose account,\nperhaps, there were some tenderer feelings in the bosom of Harley\nthan his gratitude for the friendly notice of that gentleman (though\nhe was seldom deficient in that virtue) could inspire.  Mr. Walton\nhad a daughter; and such a daughter! we will attempt some\ndescription of her by and by.\n\nHarley's notions of the ?a???, or beautiful, were not always to be\ndefined, nor indeed such as the world would always assent to, though\nwe could define them.  A blush, a phrase of affability to an\ninferior, a tear at a moving tale, were to him, like the Cestus of\nCytherea, unequalled in conferring beauty.  For all these Miss\nWalton was remarkable; but as these, like the above-mentioned\nCestus, are perhaps still more powerful when the wearer is possessed\nof souse degree of beauty, commonly so called, it happened, that,\nfrom this cause, they had more than usual power in the person of\nthat young lady.\n\nShe was now arrived at that period of life which takes, or is\nsupposed to take, from the flippancy of girlhood those\nsprightlinesses with which some good-natured old maids oblige the\nworld at three-score."}

They\npestered Mr. Korley to bring them up the last novels. But his mind\nwas too full of stocks; he always forgot the novels. On Saturday he\nwent over to Newtown, hearing there was a circulating library there.\nHe found the sign, but no books. \"I had some books once,\" the\nproprietor explained, \"but the Wheathedge folks carried them all off\nand never returned them.\" Thus it happened that when the week after\nmy visit to the free reading-room, I met Mr. Korley on board the\ntrain, he remarked to me, \"We ought to have a circulating library at\nWheathedge.\"\n\n\"And a reading-room with it,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" said he. \"That's a fact. A good reading-room would be a\ncapital thing.\"\n\n\"Think of the scores of young men,\" said I, \"that are going down to\nruin there. They have no home, no decent shelter even for a winter's\nevening, except the grog-shop.\"\n\n\"I don't care so much about the young men,\" said Mr. Korley, \"as I\ndo about the middle-aged ones: My Jennie pesters me almost to death\nevery time I go down, to buy her something to read. Of course I\nalways forget it. Besides, I would like a place where I could see\nthe papers and periodicals myself. I would give fifty dollars to see\na good library and reading-room in Wheathedge.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said I, \"I will put you down for that amount.\" So I\ntook out my pocket-book and made a memorandum.\n\n\"What! are you taking subscriptions?\" asked Mr. Korley.\n\n\"Have taken one,\" said I.\n\nThat was the beginning. That night I took a blank book and drew up a\nsubscription paper. It was very simple. It read as follows:\n\n\"We, the undersigned, for the purpose of establishing a library and\nreading-room in Wheathedge, subscribe the sums set opposite our\nnames, and agree that when $500 is subscribed the first subscribers\nshall call a meeting of the others to form an organization.\"\n\nI put Mr. Korley's name down for $50, which started it well. Mr.\nJowett could do no less than Mr. Korley, and Mr. Wheaton no less\nthan Mr. Jowett; and so, the subscription once started, grew very\nrapidly, like a boy's snowball, to adequate proportions. The second\nTuesday in July I was enabled to give notice to all the subcribers\nto meet at my house. My parlors were well filled. I had taken pains\nto get some lady subscribers, and they were there as well as the\ngentlemen. I read to the company the law of the State providing for\nthe organization of a library association. Resolutions were drawn up\nand adopted. Stock was fixed at $5, that everybody might be a\nstockholder. The annual dues were made $2, imposed alike on\nstockholders and on outsiders. A Board of trustees was elected. And\nso our little boat was fairly launched.\n\nWe began in a very humble way. The school trustees loaned us during\nthe summer vacation a couple of recitation-rooms which we converted\ninto a library and conversation-room. The former we furnished in the\nfirst instance with the popular magazines and two or three of the\ndaily newspapers. We forthwith began also to accumulate something of\na library. Mr. Wheaton presented us with a full assortment of Patent\nOffice reports, which will be very valuable for reference if any\nbody should ever want to refer to them. We also have two shelves\nfull chiefly of old school-books, which a committee on donations\nsucceeded in raising in the neighborhood.\n\nBut apart from these treasures of knowledge our collection is\neminently readable. Maurice Mapleson is on the library committee,\nand Maurice Mapleson is fortunately a very sensible man. \"The first\nthing,\" he says, \"is to get books that people will read. Valuable\nbooks that they won't read may as well stay on the publishers'\nshelves as on ours.\" So as yet we buy only current literature. We\nrarely purchase any book in more than two volumes. We have a good\nliberal assortment of modern novels-but they are selected with some\ncare. We sprinkle in a good proportion of popular history and\npopular science. The consequence is our library is used. The books\nreally circulate. Our conversation-room has proved quite as popular\nas the library. It is furnished with chess and checkers. What is\nmore important it is furnished with young ladies. For the Wheathedge\nlibrary knows neither male nor female. And the young men find our\ncheckers more attractive than Tom Poole's cards. They are ready to\nexchange the stale tobacco smoke and bad whiskey of his bar-room for\nthe fair, fresh faces that make our reading-room so attractive. The\nboys, too, as a class are very willing to give up the shameless\npictorial literature of his free reading-room for Harper's and the\nIllustrated Christian Weekly. In a word the Wheathedge library\nbecame so universally popular that when the opening of the school\nthreatened to crowd us out of our quarters, there was no difficulty\nin raising the money to build a small house, large enough for our\npresent and prospective needs. The only objection was Mr. Hardcap.\nFor Mr. Hardcap does not approve of novels.\n\nThis objection came out when I first asked him for a subscription,\npayable in work on the new building.\n\n\"Do you have novels in your library?\" said he.\n\n\"Of course,\" said I.\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"don't come to me for any help. I won't do anything\nto encourage the reading of novels.\"\n\n\"You do not approve of novels, then, I judge, Mr. Hardcap?\" said I.\n\n\"Approve of novels!\" said he, energetically. \"If I had my way, the\npestiferous things should never come near my house. I totally\ncondemn them. I don't see how any consistent Christian can suffer\nthem. They're a pack of lies, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Do you not think,\" said I, \"that we ought to discriminate; that\nthere are different sorts of novels, and that we ought not to\ncondemn the good with the bad?\"\n\n\"I don't believe in no kind of fiction, nohow,\" said Mr. Hardcap,\nemphatically. \"What we want is facts, Mr. Laicus-hard facts. That's\nwhat I was brought up on when I was a boy, and that's what I mean to\nbring my boys up on.\"\n\nI thought of Mr. Gradgrind, but said nothing.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Hardcap, half soliloquizing, \"there is Charles\nDickens. He was nothing in the world but a novel writer, and they\nburied him in Westminster Cathedral, as though he were a saint; and\npreached sermons about him, and glorified him in our religious\npapers. Sallie is crazy to get a copy of his works, and even wife\nwants to read some of them. But they'll have to go out of my house\nto do it, I tell ye. Why, they couldn't make more to do if it was\nBunyan or Milton.\"\n\n\"Bunyan?\" said I. \"Do you mean the author of Pilgrim's Progress?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he: \"that is a book. Why, it's worth a hundred of your\nmodern novels.\"\n\n\"How is that?\" said I. \"Pilgrim's Progress, if I mistake not, is\nfiction.\"\n\n\"Oh! well,\" said .Mr. Hardcap, \"that's a very different thing. It\nisn't a novel. It's a allegory. That's altogether different.\"\n\n\"What is the difference?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh! well,\" said he, \"that's altogether different. I suppose it is\nfictitious; but then it's altogether different. It's a allegory.\"\n\n\"Now I don't approve,\" continued Mr. Hardcap, without explaining\nhimself any further, \"of our modern Sunday-school libraries. I have\ncomplained a good deal, but it's no use. Tom brings home a story\nbook every Sunday. I can't very well say he shan't take any books\nout of the library, and I don't want to take him out of\nSunday-school. But I don't like these Sunday-school stories. They\nare nothing but little novels anyhow. And they're all lies. I don't\nbelieve in telling stories to teach children. If I had my way, there\nwouldn't be but one book in the library. That would be the Bible.\"\n\n\"You could hardly leave in all the Bible,\" said I. \"You would have\nto cross out the parable of the prodigal son.\"\n\n\"The parable of the prodigal son!\" exclaimed Mr. Hardcap, in\nastonishment.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I: \"that is, if you did not allow any fiction in your\nSunday reading.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said he, \"that's very different. That's not fiction; that's a\nparable. That's entirely different. Besides,\" continued he, \"I don't\nknow what right you have to assume that it is a story at all. I have\nno doubt that it is true. Christ says distinctly that a man had two\nsons, and one came and asked him for his portion. He tells it all\nfor a fact, and I think it very dishonoring to him to assume that it\nis not. I have no doubt that he knew just such a case.\"\n\n\"And the same thing is true of the parable of the lost sheep, and\nthe lost piece of money, and the sower, and the merchantman, and the\npearl, and the unfaithful steward?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I have no doubt of it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"that is at least a new view of Scripture teaching.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt it is the correct one,\" said he. \"I don't believe\nthere is any fiction in the Bible at all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"when you get home you read Jotham's story of the\ntrees, in the Book of Judges; I think it's about the ninth chapter.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said he; \"but if it's in the Bible I have no doubt it is\ntrue, no doubt whatever.\"\n\nBut in spite of Mr. Hardcap, the Wheathedge library flourished; and\nnext week our new quarters are to be dedicated to the cause of\nliterature and temperance by a public meeting. And I am assured by\nthose that know, that Tom Poole's business was never so poor as it\nhas been since we started our opposition to his free reading-room.\n\nMiss Moore asked Maurice Mapleson last week to suggest a subject for\nan illuminated motto to hang on the wall of the reading-room over\nthe librarian's desk.\n\n\"Overcome evil with good,\" said he.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nMaurice Mapleson Tries an Experiment.\n\n\nFIVE or six weeks ago Maurice came to me in some excitement. \"Mr.\nLaicus,\" said he, \"is it true that ten of you gentlemen have to\ncontribute thirty dollars a piece this year to make up my salary?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\n\"Why, John,\" said Jennie.\n\n\"We didn't have to do it,\" I continued. But in point of fact we do\nit.\"\n\n\"I don't like that,\" said he soberly. \"If the church can't pay me\nfifteen hundred dollars a year I do not want to receive it. I\nthought the church was strong and well able to do all it professed\nto do.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Mapleson,\" said I, \"you attend to the spiritual\ninterests of the church and leave its finances to us. If we cannot\npay you all we have promised, we will come and beg off. Till then\nyou just take it for granted that it's all right.\"\n\nMaurice shook his head.\n\n\"Why, my dear friend,\" said I, \"how much do you suppose I pay for\npew rent?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea,\" said he.\n\n\"Fifty dollars,\" said I. \"That provides myself and wife and Harry\nwith a pew in church twice on the Sabbath if we want it. It pays for\nHarry's Sabbath-school instruction and for your service as a pastor\nto me and to mine. But we will make no account of that. Fifty\ndollars a Sabbath is a dollar a week, fifty cents a service, twenty\ncents a head. Harry half price, and the Sabbath-school, and the\nprayer-meetings, and the pastoral work thrown in. It is cheaper than\nany lecturer would give it to us, and a great deal better quality\ntoo. My pew rent isn't what I pay for the support of the Gospel. It\nis what I pay for my own spiritual bread and butter. It won't hurt\nme, nor Deacon Goodsole, nor Mr. Wheaton, nor Mr. Gowett, nor any\none else on that list to contribute thirty dollars more for the\ncause of Christ and the good of the community.\"\n\nMaurice shook his head thoughtfully, but said nothing more about it\nthen, and the matter dropped.\n\nThe last week in December we have our annual meeting. It is\ngenerally rather a stupid affair. The nine or ten gentlemen who\nconstitute the board of trustees meet in the capacity of an\necclesiastical society. In the capacity of a board of trustees they\nreport to themselves in the capacity of a society. In the capacity\nof a society they accept the report which they have presented in the\ncapacity of a board of trustees, and pass unanimously a resolution\nof thanks to the board, i. e. themselves, for the efficient and\nenergetic manner in which they have discharged their duties. They\nthen ballot in a solemn manner for themselves for the ensuing year\nand elect the ticket without opposition. And the annual meeting is\nover.\n\nBut this year our annual meeting was a very different affair. The\nSabbath preceding, the parson preached a sermon on the text: \"The\npoor have the Gospel preached to them.\" In this sermon he advocated\na free-pew system. His arguments were not very fresh or new (there\nis not much that is new to be said on the subject) till he came to\nthe close. Then he startled us all by making the following\nproposition:\n\n\"The chief objection,\" said he, \"to the free-pew system is the\nquestion, 'Where shall the money come from?' From God, I answer. I\nbelieve if we feed his poor, he will feed us. I, for one, am willing\nto trust Him, at least for one year.\"\n\nIt slipped out very naturally, and there was a little laugh in the\ncongregation at the preacher's expense. But he was very much in\nearnest.\n\n\"I propose to the society to throw open the doors of this church,\nand declare all the pews free. Provide envelopes and papers, and\nscatter them through the pews. Let each man write thereon what he is\nwilling to pay for the support of the Gospel, and whether he will\npay it weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-quarterly or annually. Give\nthese sealed envelopes to me. No one shall know what they contain\nbut myself and the treasurer. I will pay out of the proceeds all the\ncurrent expenses of the church, except the interest. Whatever\nremains, I will take as my salary. The interest, the trustees will\nprovide out of the plate collections and with the aid of the ladies.\nThis is my proposition. Consider it seriously, earnestly,\nprayerfully, and come together next Wednesday night to act\nintelligently upon it.\"\n\nI hardly think the minister's eloquence would have sufficed to carry\nthis plan, but the treasurer's balance-sheet helped his case\namazingly.\n\nI supposed there would be a small deficit, but thought I knew it\ncould not be very great. But I had not reckoned on the genius for\nincapacity which characterises church boards. To have the unusual\ndeficit, which was involved by the increase of the parson's salary,\nprovided for by a special subscription was more than they could\nbear. They had regarded it as their duty, made plain by the example\nof their predecessors in office for many years, to bring the church\nin debt, and nobly had they fulfilled their duty. On the strength of\nthat extraordinary subscription they had rushed into extraordinary\nexpenditures with a looseness that was marvellous to behold.\n\nHere is the annual exhibit as it appears in the treasurer's report:\n\nBALANCE SHEET.\nCr.\nPew-rents\n$1,250.00\nSunday Collections\n325.25\nReceived by a Ladies' Fair\n113.34\nSpecial Subscription\n300.00\n\n$1,988.59\n\nDr.\nMinister's Salary\n$1,500.00\nOrganist (a new expenditure advocated by Mr. Wheaton because of the Special\nSubscription), Six months' salary\n100.00\nChurch Repairs, (a new fence and new blinds, &c., advocated by Mr. Wheaton\nbecause of the Special Subscription)\n134.75\nReed Organ for the Sabbath-School (advocated by Mr. Wheaton because of the\nSpecial Subscription)\n150.00\nInterest on Mortgage\n315.00\nSexton\n200.00\nFire, lights and incidentals\n225.00\nCommission for collecting pew-rents\n55.75\n\n$2,680.50\n\n1,988.59\nDeficit\n$691.91\n\nOf course, the minister's salary was behind; and, of course, the\nminister was behind to the grocer, and the baker, and the butcher,\nand the dry-goods dealer; and, of course, everybody felt blue. There\nwas a good deal of informal discussion before the parson's\nproposition was taken up. Mr. Hardcap wanted to decrease the\nminister's salary. Mr. Wheaton wanted to raise the pew rents. Mr.\nLeacock thought Mr. Wheaton could afford to give up his mortgage on\nthe church. Mr. Line proposed to take up a subscription, pay the\nbalance off on the spot, and begin the new year afresh. Mr. Gazbag\nthought it ought to be left to the ladies to clear off the debt with\na concert or something of that sort. Mr. Cerulian thought (though he\nsaid it very quietly) that if we had a minister who could draw\nbetter, we shouldn't have any difficulty."}

{"ID": 1505, "text": "The opening in the ceiling may be formed simply by the space between the four cross-beams,\nor it may be supported by a pillar--of marble or of brick cased with marble--at each corner,\nor it may rest upon a greater number of such pillars. It is this opening which lets in the\nlight and air to the hall, and it should always be remembered that the Italian house had more\noccasion to seek coolness and freshness than warmth. On a day of glaring sunshine and heat\nit was always possible to spread under the opening an awning or curtain of purple or other\ncolour, of which the reflected hues meanwhile lent a richness to the space below. If we take\none of the finer houses, we shall see, in glancing at the ceiling which covers the rest of\nthe hall, that it is divided into sunken panels or coffers, which are adorned with reliefs\nin stucco and are painted, or else are decorated with copper, gold or ivory. The height may\nbe whatever the owner wishes, but perhaps 25 feet would be a modest average estimate. The floor\nin such a house will generally consist of slabs of marble or of marble tiles arranged in patterns.\nIn houses of less show it may be made of the same materials as those described for the entrance\npassage. To right and left are various chambers, shut off by lofty doors or by porti\u00e8res or\nboth. To these light is admitted their doors and the gratings over them, from the high window-slits\nalready mentioned in the outer wall, or sometimes, when there is no upper storey, from sky-lights.\nAnd here let it be observed that the notion that the Romans of this date used very little glass\nis altogether erroneous, as the discoveries at Pompeii and elsewhere sufficiently prove.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Interior of Roman House. (Looking from Reception-hall to Peristyle.)]\n\nThe walls of the hall are in the better instances either coated with panels of tinted marble,\nor parcelled out in bright bands or oblongs of paint, or decorated with pictures of mythological,\narchitectural, and other subjects worked in bright colours upon darkened stucco. To our own\ntaste these colours--red, yellow, bluish-green, and others--as seen at Pompeii, are often excessively\ncrude and badly harmonised. But while it is true that the ancients appear to have been actually\nsomewhat deficient in colour-sense, it must be borne in mind that many of the Pompeian houses\nwere decorated by journeymen rather than by artists, and, above all, full allowance must be\nmade for the comparatively subdued light in which most of the paintings would be seen. The\nhall might also contain statuary placed against the walls or against the supporting pillars,\nwhere these existed. At the farther end from the entrance you will perceive to right and left\ntwo large recesses or bays, generally with pilasters on either side. These \"wings\" were utilised\nfor a variety of purposes. One of them might occasionally serve for a smaller dining-room,\nor it might hold presses and cupboards. In noble houses one of them would contain certain family\npossessions of which the occupants were especially proud. These were the effigies of distinguished\nancestors, which served as a family-tree represented in a highly objective form. At our chosen\ndate there would be a series of portrait busts or else of portrait medallions, in relief or\npainted, while in special receptacles, labelled underneath with name and rank, were kept life-like\nwax masks of the line of distinguished persons, which could be brought out and carried in procession\nat the funeral of a member of the family. Though there was no \"College of Heralds\" in antiquity,\nit was commonly quite possible for a wealthy parvenu to get a pedigree invented for him. It\nis true that by use and wont the \"right of effigies\" was confined to those families which had\nheld the higher offices of state, but there was no specific law on the subject, and the Roman\n_nouveau riche_ could act exactly like his modern representative in securing his \"portraits\nof ancestors.\"\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--HOUSE OF CORNELIUS RUFUS. (Pompeii.)]\n\nHaving thus glanced to right and left, to the ceiling and the floor, we now look at the end\nof the hall facing us. The middle section of this is open, and is framed by a couple of high\npillars or pilasters and a cornice, which together formed perhaps the most distinguishing feature\nof this part of the house. Between the pillars is an apartment which may or may not be raised\na step or two above the level of the hall. This, unlike the hall itself, is of the nature of\na sitting-room, reception-room, or \"parlour\" (in the old sense of that word), and contains\nappropriate furniture. In it the master receives a guest, interviews his clients, makes up\nhis accounts, and transacts such other private business as may fall to his lot. At the back\nit may be entirely closed, or it may contain a large window, through which we can catch a vista\nof the colonnaded and planted court beyond. The floor may here consist of a large carpet-like\nmosaic, such as that famous piece, taken from the House of the Faun at Pompeii and now in the\nNaples Museum, which represents a battle between Alexander and the Persians. To one side of\nthe entrance to this \"parlour\" there will often stand on a pedestal the bust of the owner,\nas \"Genius of the home.\" On the other side there is a passage serving as the means of access\nto the second or inner division of the house.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--PERISTYLE WITH GARDEN AND AL FRESCO DINING-TABLE.]\n\nOn making our way through this passage we find ourselves in a space still more open than the\nhall. It is commonly an unroofed, quadrangular court surrounded by a roofed colonnade, and\nthence known as the \"peristyle.\" Or the colonnade may extend only round three sides, the back\nbeing free to the garden. In the uncovered space lying between the rows of pillars there are\nornamental shrubs and flowers, marble tables, a cistern of water containing goldfish, a fountain,\nand marble basins into which fresh water is spouted from bronze or marble statuettes, from\nfigures of animals, or from masks. Under the colonnade are marble floors or other more or less\nrich pavements, decorated walls, and such works of art as the owner most affects.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--PERISTYLE IN HOUSE OF THE VETTII. (Present state.)]\n\nWhen it seems desirable for shade and coolness, coloured curtains or awnings may be suspended\nbetween the columns, so that one can sit or walk with comfort under the cloistered portion.\nAt the sides are apartments for different purposes. At the far end, or elsewhere, there is\nregularly the largest dining-room, often with mosaic floor and generally with pictured walls.\nWhereabouts in the house the family or an invited party should dine would depend partly on\nthe number to be present, partly on the season of the year, and partly on some passing inclination.\nA house of any pretensions would possess several rooms used, or capable of being used, for\nthis purpose. Some dining-rooms had what we should call French windows on three sides, permitting\nthe diners to enjoy the view of the garden or the shrubbery outside.\n\nOther large and airy apartments or saloons off the peristyle were used for social conversation,\nor as drawing-rooms. Farther back still, approached by another passage or door, there was often\nto be found a garden, containing an arbour or a terrace covered with a trailing vine, of the\nkind known in modern Italy as a _pergola_. In suitable weather _al fresco_ meals were often\ntaken here, and occasionally there were fixed couches and tables of masonry always ready for\nthat purpose.\n\nComing back from the garden into the court, we might explore other passages, leading to the\nkitchen or to the bathrooms of hot, warm, and cold water. These offices would be respectively\nsituated wherever circumstances made them most convenient. In the kitchen the part corresponding\nto our \"range\" consisted of a flat structure of masonry, on which the fire was lighted. The\ncooking pots were placed either upon ridges of masonry running across the fire or upon three\nlegged stands of iron. The accompanying illustrations will sufficiently show what is meant.\nThe bedrooms, little better than cells, of the slaves, and also the storerooms, were variously\ndistributed. Underground cellars were apparently exceptional, although examples may be seen\nat Pompeii.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--KITCHEN HEARTH IN THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII.]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--KITCHEN HEARTHS (Drawing).]\n\nSomewhere in one of the bays of the hall, at the back of the peristyle court, or elsewhere,\nwould be found a small shrine for the worship of the domestic gods. This was variously constructed.\nSometimes it was a niche or recess containing paintings or little effigies and with an altar\nor altar-shelf beneath, sometimes a miniature temple erected against the wall. There was apparently\nno special place to which, rather than any other, it was to be assigned. To the nature and\nmeaning of the household gods we may refer again when dealing with the general subject of religion.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--SHRINE (IN BACKGROUND) IN HOUSE OF THE TRAGIC POET.]\n\nIn the homes of persons of culture there would also be included a library and, perhaps less\nregularly, a picture-gallery. The library, which sometimes comprised thousands of rolls, would\nbe a room not only surrounded by large pigeon-holes or open cupboards containing the round\nboxes for the parchment rolls, but also traversed by lower partitions provided on either side\nwith similar shelves. About the room, over or by the shelves, stand portrait busts or medallions\nof great authors, both Greek and Roman, the \"blind\" Homer being represented in traditional\nform, but the majority, from Aeschylus and Thucydides down to Virgil and Livy, being authentic\nand excellent likenesses. In the picture-gallery would be found paintings either done upon\nthe stucco walls in a frame-like setting or upon panels of wood attached to the walls, very\nmuch as we hang our modern pictures.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--HOUSEHOLD SHRINE.]\n\nIt was scarcely ever the case that a second storey--where one existed at all--extended over\nthe whole house. If upper rooms were used, they were placed over those parts where they would\ninterfere least with the light, the comfort, and the appearance of the ground-floor arrangements.\nThe stairs leading to them were variously disposed and as little as possible in evidence. In\nsuch upper apartments there was naturally not the same risk from the curious or the burglar\nas in the case of the lower, and windows of perhaps 4 by 2-1/2 feet were therefore freely employed.\nIn some instances, though we cannot tell how frequently, the second storey projected on strong\nbeams over the street, as in the example at Pompeii known as the \"House of the Hanging Balcony.\"\n\nIt remains to make brief observations upon one or two matters interesting to any practical\nhouseholder. These are the questions of water-supply, drainage, warming, and roofing.\n\nIn respect of water there was no difficulty. It was brought in the ordinary way, from those\nreservoirs which formed the ends of the aqueducts or conduits, by means of pipes, mostly made\nof lead, though sometimes of bronze. These were conducted to the points where they were required,\nand there the flow was manipulated by means of taps and plugs. In order to make a water-pipe,\na sheet of lead or bronze was rolled into a cylinder, the joining of the two edges taking the\nshape of a raised ridge, which was soldered. One end of a section was squeezed or narrowed\nso that it might be inserted into the widened end of the next. Lead pipes of no inconsiderable\nsize, stamped with the name of the owner, are to be seen preserved in the Palatine House of\nLivia, and a number of smaller ones remain at Pompeii. For drainage there the sewers, and also\npipes to carry the less offensive overflow of water into the street channels, which in their\nturn led into underground drains.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 88 A.--LEADEN PIPES IN HOUSE OF LIVIA. (Palatine.)]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--PORTABLE BRAZIERS.]\n\nFor the warming of a house the Romans not only portable braziers with charcoal for fuel, but\nin the larger establishments there existed a system of \"central\" heating, by which hot air\nwas conducted from a furnace in the basement through flues running beneath the floor and up\nthrough the walls, where its effect might be regulated by adjustable openings or registers.\nThe only fixed fire-place in a town house was in the kitchen. From this the smoke was carried\noff by a flue, constituting to all intents and purposes a chimney. The belief that the Romans\nwere unacquainted with such things as chimneys has been proved to be untrue.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--MANNER OF ROOFING WITH TILES.]\n\nThe roofing, when constructed, as it most frequently was, in a gabled form, consisted of terra-cotta\ntiles arranged on a regular system. First came the flat layers, each higher row overlapping\nthe lower. The descending edges of a row of these flat plates, as they lay side by side, were\nturned up into a kind of flange of about 2-1/4 inches in height, so that at the points of contact\na ridge was formed down the roof. Over this line was laid a series of other tiles shaped into\na half-cylinder, the lower end of each tile overlapping the next. By this means the rain was\nprevented from penetrating the crevice between the flanges. At the bottom, above the eaves,\nthe line of semicircular tiles ended in a flower-like or mask-like ornament, which broke the\nmonotony of the horizontal edge of the roof.\n\nAfter this description of what may be considered a representative Roman house, it is necessary\nto repeat that it is but typical. Many were considerably smaller, containing, for example,\nno peristyle. Many on the contrary were far more spacious and sumptuous, possessing more than\none hall and more than one peristyle, and varying the nature as well as the number and position\nof those portions of the house. In exceptional cases the hall had no opening in the ceiling\nand therefore no basin below, but was covered with a simple gabled roof which shed the rain-water\ninto the street. In exceptional cases also there was no \"parlour\" of the kind described a little\nwhile ago. The situation of the house, enlargements made after the main part was built, the\njoining of two houses into one, or other causes, often modified the rectangular and symmetrical\nappearance presented in the plan hitherto given. Such modifications are, however, better illustrated\nby a comparison of the plans of two well-known Pompeian houses than by any amount of verbal\ndescription. The first is that of Pansa, which forms the main portion of a whole block, smaller\ndwellings and shops unconnected with the Pansa establishment being built round and into it\nat various points. The arrangements of this house closely approach the normal or simple type\ndescribed in this chapter. The second is the famous house of the Vettii, which departs somewhat\nfreely from the customary disposition of apartments.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--HOUSE OF PANSA AT POMPEII.]\n\nThe parts within the dark lines belong to the one house; the rest are other houses and shops\nbuilt into the block.\n\n 1.

A second storey extended over the\ncorners and front parts included under the nine small crosses.]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 43--SPECIMEN OF PAINTED ROOM.]\n\nIt would be tempting to indulge in rhetoric and to dwell upon the magnificence of some of the\nmore luxurious houses of the wealthy Romans; to describe their ostentation of rich marbles\nin pillar, wall, or floor--the white marbles of Carrara, Paros, and Hymettus; the Phrygian\nmarble or \"pavonazzetto\" its streakings of crimson or violet; the orange-golden glow of the\nNumidian stone of \"giallo antico\"; the Carystian marble or \"cipollino\" with its onion-like\nlayers of white and pale-green; the serpentine variety from Laconia, and the porphyry from\nEgypt. We might descant upon the lavish wall-paintings, representing landscapes real and imaginary,\nscenes from mythology and semi-history, floating figures, genre pictures, and pictures of still\nlife; or upon the mosaics in floor and wall depicting similar subjects and often serving to\nthe occupants not so much in the place of pictorial art as in the place of wall-papers and\nof Brussels or Kidderminster carpets. We might speak of the profuse collections of statuary,\nof the gilding on ceiling and cornices, of the colours shed by the rich curtains and awnings\nof purple and crimson, of the grateful sound of water plashing in the fountains and basins\nor babbling over a series of steps like a broken cascade in miniature. But perhaps too much\nof such description might only encourage still further the erroneous notion that the Roman\nhouses were all of this nature, and that even the average Roman lived in the midst of an abundance\nof such domestic luxury and art. It requires but a little sober thought to realise that such\nhomes were, as they have always been, the exception. It would be as reasonable to judge of\nan average London house by the most opulent specimens in Park Lane, or of an American house\nby the richest at Newport, as to judge of the abodes of Romans in the time of Nero by the examples\nwhich appeal so strongly to the novelist or the romancing historian. Suffice it that beside\nthe modest and frugal homes, the tenement flat, and the hovel, there were houses distinguished\nby immense luxury; and, since Romans have at all times sought the ostentatious and grandiose,\nperhaps such dwellings were larger and more pretentious in proportion to wealth than they are\nin most civilised countries at the present day. Seneca, who made himself extremely comfortable\nin the days of Nero, exclaims upon the rage for costly decoration. Says he of the bathing of\nthe plutocrat: \"He seems to himself poor and mean, unless the walls shine with great costly\nslabs, unless marbles of Alexandria are picked out with reliefs of Numidian stone, unless the\nwhole ceiling is elaborately worked with all the variety of a painting, unless Thasian stone\nencloses the swimming baths, unless the water is poured out from silver taps.\" These, indeed,\nare comparatively humble. \"What of the baths of the freedmen? a mass of statues! What a multitude\nof pillars supporting nothing, but put there only for ornament! What an amount of water running\nover steps with a purling noise--and all for show!\"\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--SPECIMEN OF WALL-PAINTING. (Pompeii.)]\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE COUNTRY HOMESTEAD AND COUNTRY SEAT\n\nThroughout the romanized parts of the empire--in other words, wherever Romans settled, in Italy,\nSpain, Gaul, Britain, and also wherever the richer natives imitated the Roman fashions--the\nhouse in any city or considerable town was built as nearly as possible after the type described.\n\nIn the country the poor naturally had their much simpler cottages and cabins of a room or two,\ncommonly thatched or shingled, knowing nothing of hall and court and all these arrangements\nof art and luxury. In the case of the more well-to-do country people of Italy--the larger farmers,\nwine-growers, olive-growers, and the like--the homestead was of a kind which made for simplicity\nand comfort. It was in such homes that one would find the most wholesome life and the soundest\nmoral fibre of the time.\n\nNormally the homestead would be a large, and often a rambling, building of one storey, except\nwhere a tower served as a store-room for the mellowing wine or a loft for the mellowing fruit.\nWhen we read in Horace about the liberal stack of wood to be kept in readiness near the hearth,\nand about the wine-jar drinking in the smoke in the store-room we must think of his country\nhomestead on the Sabine Hills, not of a house in Rome, for at Rome there was no blazing hearth\nto sit round and no smoky tower-loft for the ripening of the Caecuban.\n\nYou enter an open court or yard, round the sides of which may run the stalls of the horses\nand oxen of the farm, the tool-rooms, the lofts of hay and corn, the quarters of the labourers--herdsmen,\nploughmen, vine-dressers--and the great farm-kitchen. It is in this kitchen that you will find\nthe bright hearth in winter-time, where all the members of the homestead gather round the fire.\nIt is here that they then all eat, and in it the women of the establishment perform their work,\nspinning and weaving and mending. Off from the court will be situated the wine-press, or the\nolive-press, the-granaries, the fruit mellowing on mats, and the various rooms or bins where\nwine is fermented and stored, or where the olive-oil is treated and stocked. Commonly a more\nretired court will contain the private rooms of the owner, and somewhere in the homestead will\nbe found the fowl-yard, with its hens, ducks, geese, and guinea-fowl, the sties, and the preserves\nfor various toothsome animals, including perhaps dormice and snails.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--PLAN OF HOMESTEAD AT BOSCOREALE.]\n\nFrequently a Roman of the city affected a country house of this character, to which he would\nflee during the tyrannous reign of the Dogstar or the Lion---in other words, during that hot\nseason of the year which requires no description for those who have been so ill-advised as\nto sojourn in Rome in July, August, and early September. Many of his town slaves he would take\nwith him, and what was a holiday for him was also a holiday for them. His rural homestead would\npossess great charm for the quieter type of man who had no real love for the pomps and shows\nthe rattle and tumult, of the city. The vision of wholesome country-produce--of fresh milk\nand eggs and vegetables, and of tender poultry--is one which still attracts our city-folk.\nBut the vision, then as now, was often subject to disillusion. Complaints are many that you\nhad to feed the homestead in place of it feeding you, and when Martial has given a pleasant\npicture of a family reaching the gate of Rome with a coachful of the typical produce of the\ncountry, he ends by suddenly letting you know that they are not coming in from their country\nhouse but are going out to it. The complaint of the English seaside town that there will be\nno fish \"till the train comes in from London,\" is thus a sufficiently old one. Yet the same\nMartial supplies another picture, painted with such zest of frank enjoyment that we are at\nonce convinced of its truth. Some portions of it perhaps admit of translation in the following\nterms:--\n\n      Our friend Fundanus' Baian seat,\n      My Bassus, is no pleasance neat,\n      Where myrtles trim in idle lines,\n      Clipped box, and planes unwed to vines\n      Rob of right use the acres wide:\n      'Tis farm-life true and countrified.\n      In every corner grain is stacked,\n      Old wines in fragrant jars are packed:\n      About the farmyard gabbling gander\n      And spangled peacock freely wander:\n      With pheasant and flamingo prowl\n      Partridge and speckled guinea-fowl:\n      Pigeon and waxen turtle-dove\n      Rustle their wings in cotes above.\n      The farm-wife's apron draws a rout\n      Of greedy porkers round about;\n      And eagerly the tender lamb\n      Waits the filled udder of its dam."}

When do you return?\"\n\n\"In a week--that is, Friday next week. Is there anything you need?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\" She rose, came close and kissed him on the cheek near\nhis lips. \"A safe journey.

It may become advisable for us to cooperate with other commercial powers in promoting\nthe rights of trade and residence in the Kongo Valley free from the interference or political\ncontrol of any one nation.\n\nIn view of the frequency of invitations from foreign governments to participate in social and\nscientific congresses for the discussion of important matters of general concern, I repeat\nthe suggestion of my last message that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary\npower by the Executive in appointing delegates to such convocations. Able specialists are ready\nto serve the national interests in such capacity without personal profit or other compensation\nthan the defrayment of expenses actually incurred, and this a comparatively small annual appropriation\nwould suffice to meet.\n\nI have alluded in my previous messages to the injurious and vexatious restrictions suffered\nby our trade in the Spanish West Indies. Brazil, whose natural outlet for its great national\nstaple, coffee, is in and through the United States, imposes a heavy export duty upon that\nproduct. Our petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other Eastern ports by restrictions\nas to storage and by onerous taxation. For these mischiefs adequate relief is not always afforded\nby reciprocity treaties like that with Hawaii or that lately negotiated with Mexico and now\nawaiting the action of the Senate. Is it not advisable to provide some measure of equitable\nretaliation in our relations with governments which discriminate against our own?

Arthur December 1, 1884\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n\nSince the close of your last session the American people, in the exercise of their highest\nright of suffrage, have chosen their Chief Magistrate for the four years ensuing.\n\nWhen it is remembered that at no period in the country's history has the long political contest\nwhich customarily precedes the day of the national election been waged with greater fervor\nand intensity, it is a subject of general congratulation that after the controversy at the\npolls was over, and while the slight preponderance by which the issue had been determined was\nas yet unascertained, the public peace suffered no disturbance, but the people everywhere patiently\nand quietly awaited the result.\n\nNothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the American citizen, his love of order,\nand his loyalty to law. Nothing could more signally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of\nour political institutions.\n\nEight years have passed since a controversy concerning the result of a national election sharply\ncalled the attention of the Congress to the necessity of providing more precise and definite\nregulations for counting the electoral vote.\n\nIt is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before conflicting claims to the\nPresidency shall again distract the country, and I am persuaded that by the people at large\nany of the measures of relief thus far proposed would be preferred to continued inaction.\n\nOur relations with all foreign powers continue to be amicable.\n\nWith Belgium a convention has been signed whereby the scope of present treaties has been so\nenlarged as to secure to citizens of either country within the jurisdiction of the other equal\nrights and privileges in the acquisition and alienation of property. A trade-marks treaty has\nalso been concluded.\n\nThe war between Chile and Peru is at an end. For the arbitration of the claims of American\ncitizens who during its continuance suffered through the acts of the Chilean authorities a\nconvention will soon be negotiated.\n\nThe state of hostilities between France and China continues to be an embarrassing feature of\nour Eastern relations. The Chinese Government has promptly adjusted and paid the claims of\nAmerican citizens whose property was destroyed in the recent riots at Canton. I renew the recommendation\nof my last annual message, that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to China.\n\nThe true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country permitting the restriction of\nChinese immigration is likely to be again the subject of your deliberations. It may be seriously\nquestioned whether the statute passed at the last session does not violate the treaty rights\nof certain Chinese who left this country with return certificates valid under the old law,\nand who now seem to be debarred from relanding for lack of the certificates required by the new.\n\nThe recent purchase by citizens of the United States of a large trading fleet heretofore under\nthe Chinese flag has considerably enhanced our commercial importance in the East. In view of\nthe large number of vessels built or purchased by American citizens in other countries and\nexclusively employed in legitimate traffic between foreign ports under the recognized protection\nof our flag, it might be well to provide a uniform rule for their registration and documentation,\nso that the bona fide property rights of our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and properly\nguarded.\n\nPursuant to the advice of the Senate at the last session, I recognized the flag of the International\nAssociation of the Kongo as that of a friendly government, avoiding in so doing any prejudgment\nof conflicting territorial claims in that region. Subsequently, in execution of the expressed\nwish of the Congress, I appointed a commercial agent for the Kongo basin.\n\nThe importance of the rich prospective trade of the Kongo Valley has led to the general conviction\nthat it should be open to all nations upon equal terms. At an international conference for\nthe consideration of this subject called by the Emperor of Germany, and now in session at Berlin,\ndelegates are in attendance on behalf of the United States. Of the results of the conference\nyou will be duly advised.\n\nThe Government of Korea has generously aided the efforts of the United States minister to secure\nsuitable premises for the use of the legation. As the conditions of diplomatic intercourse\nwith Eastern nations demand that the legation premises be owned by the represented power, I\nadvise that an appropriation be made for the acquisition of this property by the Government.\nThe United States already possess valuable premises at Tangier as a gift from the Sultan of\nMorocco. As is stated hereafter, they have lately received a similar gift from the Siamese\nGovernment. The Government of Japan stands ready to present to us extensive grounds at Tokyo\nwhereon to erect a suitable building for the legation, court-house, and jail, and similar privileges\ncan probably be secured in China and Persia. The owning of such premises would not only effect\na large saving of the present rentals, but would permit of the due assertion of extraterritorial\nrights in those countries, and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of the United States.\n\nThe failure of Congress to make appropriation for our representation at the autonomous court\nof the Khedive has proved a serious embarrassment in our intercourse with Egypt; and in view\nof the necessary intimacy of diplomatic relationship due to the participation of this Government\nas one of the treaty powers in all matters of administration there affecting the rights of\nforeigners, I advise the restoration of the agency and consulate-general at Cairo on its former\nbasis. I do not conceive it to be the wish of Congress that the United States should withdraw\naltogether from the honorable position they have hitherto held with respect to the Khedive,\nor that citizens of this Republic residing or sojourning in Egypt should hereafter be without\nthe aid and protection of a competent representative.\n\nWith France the traditional cordial relationship continues. The colossal statue of Liberty\nEnlightening the World, the generous gift of the people of France, is expected to reach New\nYork in May next. I suggest that Congressional action be taken in recognition of the spirit\nwhich has prompted this gift and in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal upon which\nit is to be placed.\n\nOur relations with Germany, a country which contributes to our own some of the best elements\nof citizenship, continue to be cordial. The United States have extradition treaties with several\nof the German States, but by reason of the confederation of those States under the imperial\nrule the application of such treaties is not as uniform and comprehensive as the interests\nof the two countries require. I propose, therefore, to open negotiations for a single convention\nof extradition to embrace all the territory of the Empire.\n\nIt affords me pleasure to say that our intercourse with Great Britain continues to be of a\nmost friendly character.\n\nThe Government of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to continue for seven years the provisions\nof the existing reciprocity treaty. Such continuance, in view of the relations of that country\nto the American system of States, should, in my judgment, be favored.\n\nThe revolution in Hayti against the established Government has terminated. While it was in\nprogress it became necessary to enforce our neutrality laws by instituting proceedings against\nindividuals and vessels charged with their infringement. These prosecutions were in all cases\nsuccessful.\n\nMuch anxiety has lately been displayed by various European Governments, and especially by the\nGovernment of Italy, for the abolition of our import duties upon works of art. It is well to\nconsider whether the present discrimination in favor of the productions of American artists\nabroad is not likely to result, as they themselves seem very generally to believe it may, in\nthe practical exclusion of our painters and sculptors from the rich fields for observation,\nstudy, and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed.\n\nThere is prospect that the long-pending revision of the foreign treaties of Japan may be concluded\nat a new conference to be held at Tokyo. While this Government fully recognizes the equal and\nindependent station of Japan in the community of nations, it would not oppose the general adoption\nof such terms of compromise as Japan may be disposed to offer in furtherance of a uniform policy\nof intercourse with Western nations.\n\nDuring the past year the increasing good will between our own Government and that of Mexico\nhas been variously manifested. The treaty of commercial reciprocity concluded January 20, 1883,\nhas been ratified and awaits the necessary tariff legislation of Congress to become effective.\nThis legislation will, I doubt not, be among the first measures to claim your attention.\n\nA full treaty of commerce, navigation, and consular rights is much to be desired, and such\na treaty I have reason to believe that the Mexican Government stands ready to conclude.\n\nSome embarrassment has been occasioned by the failure of Congress at its last session to provide\nmeans for the due execution of the treaty of July 29, 1882, for the resurvey of the Mexican\nboundary and the relocation of boundary monuments.\n\nWith the Republic of Nicaragua a treaty has been concluded which authorizes the construction\nby the United States of a canal, railway, and telegraph line across the Nicaraguan territory.\n\nBy the terms of this treaty 60 miles of the river San Juan, as well as Lake Nicaragua, an inland\nsea 40 miles in width, are to constitute a part of the projected enterprise.\n\nThis leaves for actual canal construction 17 miles on the Pacific side and 36 miles on the\nAtlantic. To the United States, whose rich territory on the Pacific is for the ordinary purposes\nof commerce practically cut off from communication by water with the Atlantic ports, the political\nand commercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be overestimated.\n\nIt is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and liberality of its provisions\nwill command universal approval at home and abroad.\n\nThe death of our representative at Russia while at his post at St. Petersburg afforded to the\nImperial Government a renewed opportunity to testify its sympathy in a manner befitting the\nintimate friendliness which has ever marked the intercourse of the two countries.\n\nThe course of this Government in raising its representation at Bangkok to the diplomatic rank\nhas evoked from Siam evidences of warm friendship and augurs well for our enlarged intercourse.\nThe Siamese Government has presented to the United States a commodious mansion and grounds\nfor the occupancy of the legation, and I suggest that by joint resolution Congress attest its\nappreciation of this generous gift.\n\nThis government has more than once been called upon of late to take action in fulfillment of\nits international obligations toward Spain. Agitation in the island of Cuba hostile to the\nSpanish Crown having been fomented by persons abusing the sacred rights of hospitality which\nour territory affords, the officers of this Government have been instructed to exercise vigilance\nto prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at Key West and at other points near the Cuban\ncoast. I am happy to say that in the only instance where these precautionary measures were\nsuccessfully eluded the offenders, when found in our territory, were subsequently tried and\nconvicted.\n\nThe growing need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic between the Spanish Antilles\nand their natural market in the United States led to the adoption in January last of a commercial\nagreement looking to that end. This agreement has since been superseded by a more carefully\nframed and comprehensive convention, which I shall submit to the Senate for approval. It has\nbeen the aim of this negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal exchange of productions\ncarried under the flag of either country as to make the intercourse between Cuba and Puerto\nRico and ourselves scarcely less intimate than the commercial movement between our domestic\nports, and to insure a removal of the burdens on shipping in the Spanish Indies, of which in\nthe past our shipowners and shipmasters have so often had cause to complain.\n\nThe negotiation of this convention has for a time postponed the prosecution of certain claims\nof our citizens which were declared to be without the jurisdiction of the late Spanish-American\nClaims Commission, and which are therefore remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment.\nThe speedy settlement of these claims will now be urged by this Government.\n\nNegotiations for a treaty of commercial reciprocity with the Dominican Republic have been successfully\nconcluded, and the result will shortly be laid before the Senate.\n\nCertain questions between the United States and the Ottoman Empire still remain unsolved. Complaints\non behalf of our citizens are not satisfactorily adjusted. The Porte has sought to withhold\nfrom our commerce the right of favored treatment to which we are entitled by existing conventional\nstipulations, and the revision of the tariffs is unaccomplished.\n\nThe final disposition of pending questions with Venezuela has not as yet been reached, but\nI have good reason to expect an early settlement which will provide the means of reexamining\nthe Caracas awards in conformity with the expressed desire of Congress, and which will recognize\nthe justice of certain claims preferred against Venezuela.\n\nThe Central and South American Commission appointed by authority of the act of July 7, 1884,\nwill soon proceed to Mexico. It has been furnished with instructions which will be laid before\nyou. They contain a statement of the general policy of the Government for enlarging its commercial\nintercourse with American States. The commissioners have been actively preparing for their\nresponsible task by holding conferences in the principal cities with merchants and others interested\nin Central and South American trade.\n\nThe International Meridian Conference lately convened in Washington upon the invitation of\nthe Government of the United States was composed of representatives from twenty-five nations.\nThe conference concluded its labors on the 1st of November, having with substantial unanimity\nagreed upon the meridian of Greenwich as the starting point whence longitude is to be computed\nthrough 180 degrees eastward and westward, and upon the adoption, for all purposes for which\nit may be found convenient, of a universal day which shall begin at midnight on the initial\nmeridian and whose hours shall be counted from zero up to twenty-four.\n\nThe formal report of the transactions of this conference will be hereafter transmitted to the\nCongress.\n\nThis Government is in frequent receipt of invitations from foreign states to participate in\ninternational exhibitions, often of great interest and importance. Occupying, as we do, an\nadvanced position in the world's production, and aiming to secure a profitable share for our\nindustries in the general competitive markets, it is a matter of serious concern that the want\nof means for participation in these exhibitions should so often exclude our producers from\nadvantages enjoyed by those of other countries. During the past year the attention of Congress\nwas drawn to the formal invitations in this regard tendered by the Governments of England,\nHolland, Belgium, Germany, and Austria. The Executive has in some instances appointed honorary\ncommissioners. This is, however, a most unsatisfactory expedient, for without some provision\nto meet the necessary working expenses of a commission it can effect little or nothing in behalf\nof exhibitors. An International Inventions Exhibition is to be held in London next May. This\nwill cover a field of special importance, in which our country holds a foremost rank; but the\nExecutive is at present powerless to organize a proper representation of our vast national\ninterests in this direction.\n\nI have in several previous messages referred to this subject. It seems to me that a statute\ngiving to the Executive general discretionary authority to accept such invitations and to appoint\nhonorary commissioners, without salary, and placing at the disposal of the Secretary of State\na small fund for defraying their reasonable expenses, would be of great public utility.\n\nThis Government has received official notice that the revised international regulations for\npreventing collisions at sea have been adopted by all the leading maritime powers except the\nUnited States, and came into force on the 1st of September last. For the due protection of\nour shipping interests the provisions of our statutes should at once be brought into conformity\nwith these regulations.\n\nThe question of securing to authors, composers, and artists copyright privileges in this country\nin return for reciprocal rights abroad is one that may justly challenge your attention. It\nis true that conventions will be necessary for fully accomplishing this result; but until Congress\nshall by statute fix the extent to which foreign holders of copyright shall be here privileged\nit has been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such conventions. For this reason the United States\nwere not represented at the recent conference at Berne.\n\nI recommend that the scope of the neutrality laws of the United States be so enlarged as to\ncover all patent acts of hostility committed in our territory and aimed against the peace of\na friendly nation. Existing statutes prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict\nthe shipment of explosives, though the enactments in the latter respect were not framed with\nregard to international obligations, but simply for the protection of passenger travel. All\nthese statutes were intended to meet special emergencies that had already arisen. Other emergencies\nhave arisen since, and modern ingenuity supplies means for the organization of hostilities\nwithout open resort to armed vessels or to filibustering parties.\n\nI see no reason why overt preparations in this country for the commission of criminal acts\nsuch as are here under consideration should not be alike punishable whether such acts are intended\nto be committed in our own country or in a foreign country with which we are at peace.\n\nThe prompt and thorough treatment of this question is one which intimately concerns the national\nhonor.\n\nOur existing naturalization laws also need revision. Those sections relating to persons residing\nwithin the limits of the United States in 1795 and 1798 have now only a historical interest.\nSection 2172, recognizing the citizenship of the children of naturalized parents, is ambiguous\nin its terms and partly obsolete. There are special provisions of law favoring the naturalization\nof those who serve in the Army or in merchant vessels, while no similar privileges are granted\nthose who serve in the Navy or the Marine Corps.\n\n\"An uniform rule of naturalization\" such as the Constitution contemplates should, among other\nthings, clearly define the status of persons born within the United States subject to a foreign\npower (section 1992) and of minor children of fathers who have declared their intention to\nbecome citizens but have failed to perfect their naturalization. It might be wise to provide\nfor a central bureau of registry, wherein should be filed authenticated transcripts of every\nrecord of naturalization in the several Federal and State courts, and to make provision also\nfor the vacation or cancellation of such record in cases where fraud had been practiced upon\nthe court by the applicant himself or where he had renounced or forfeited his acquired citizenship.\nA just and uniform law in this respect would strengthen the hands of the Government in protecting\nits citizens abroad and would pave the way for the conclusion of treaties of naturalization\nwith foreign countries.\n\nThe legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular service certain\nchanges and reductions which have been productive of embarrassment. The population and commercial\nactivity of our country are steadily on the increase, and are giving rise to new, varying,\nand often delicate relationships with other countries. Our foreign establishment now embraces\nnearly double the area of operations that it occupied twenty years ago. The confinement of\nsuch a service within the limits of expenditure then established is not, it seems to me, in\naccordance with true economy. A community of 60,000,000 people should be adequately represented\nin its intercourse with foreign nations.\n\nA project for the reorganization of the consular service and for recasting the scheme of extraterritorial\njurisdiction is now before you. If the limits of a short session will not allow of its full\nconsideration, I trust that you will not fail to make suitable provision for the present needs\nof the service.\n\nIt has been customary to define in the appropriation acts the rank of each diplomatic office\nto which a salary is attached. I suggest that this course be abandoned and that it be left\nto the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to fix from time to time the diplomatic\ngrade of the representatives of this Government abroad as may seem advisable, provision being\ndefinitely made, however, as now, for the amount of salary attached to the respective stations.\n\nThe condition of our finances and the operations of the various branches of the public service\nwhich are connected with the Treasury Department are very fully discussed in the report of\nthe Secretary.\n\nIt appears that the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1884, were:\n\nFrom customs - $195,067,489.76\n\nFrom internal revenue - 121,586,072.51\n\nFrom all other sources - 31,866,307.65\n\nTotal ordinary revenues - 348,519,869.92\n\nThe public expenditures during the same period were:\n\nFor civil expenses - $22,312,907.71\n\nFor foreign intercourse - 1,260,766.37\n\nFor Indians - 6,475,999.29\n\nFor pensions - 55,429,228.06\n\nFor the military establishment, including river and harbor improvements and arsenals - 39,429,603.36\n\nFor the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery, and improvements at navy-yards -\n17,292,601.44\n\nFor miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light-houses, and collecting the\nrevenue - 43,939,710.00\n\nFor expenditures on account of the District of Columbia - 3,407,049.62\n\nFor interest on the public debt - 54,578,378.48\n\nFor the sinking fund - 46,790,229.50\n\nTotal ordinary expenditures - 290,926,473.83\n\nLeaving a surplus of - 57,603,396.09\n\nAs compared with the preceding fiscal year, there was a net decrease of over $21,000,000 in\nthe amount of expenditures. The aggregate receipts were less than those of the year previous\nby about $54,000,000. The falling off in revenue from customs made up nearly $20,000,000 of\nthis deficiency, and about $23,000,000 of the remainder was due to the diminished receipts\nfrom internal taxation."}

The deep work of regenerating the soul and the life, which is\nthe vital need of these people, is not done; it is not even attempted in\nthe vast majority of the negro churches of the Black Belt. \"The problem of\nthe Kanaka in my native Hawaiian Islands,\" General Armstrong once said to\nme, \"is one with that of the Southern negro. The Sandwich Islander,\nconverted, was not yet rebuilt in the forces of his manhood.\" On the side\nof his moral nature, where he is weakest, the black man of the South has\nstill to be girded and energized. In him are still the tendencies of his\nhereditary paganism, the vices of his slavehood. These will sink him\nunless his whole nature is regenerated by the ministration of a pure and\nvital Christianity.\n\nThe black man needs what every human being needs, help from above. It is\nfutile to say, he is free, let him alone. Mere freedom never yet saved a\nhuman soul. The gospel of Christ is not a mere declaration of freedom; it\nis regeneration and help from above. The more deeply a race is sinking in\ndegradation and sin, the more imperative is its call for saving power from\non high.\n\nFrom what element of our population is this cry of distress and need more\nagonizing than from the poor black man of the South? He is sinking in a\nquicksand of ignorance, poverty, and vice. There is nothing beneath to\nsupport his feet. He must go down unless he can get help from above. Those\nwho are nearest to him, and can see and feel most deeply his desperate\ncondition, plead most strongly in his behalf. \"The definition is very\nclear, sharp, and simple,\" says an honored white minister of the South,\n\"that the negroes are making a tremendous struggle to get an education and\nbe religious; but despite this struggle, the bottom strata of the race are\nbeing sucked into crime and ruin with unprecedented and increasing\nrapidity. But, wherever the efforts of white Christians to aid them are\nregular, steady, and strong, this destruction and debasement are stayed to\na marvelous degree. Here, then, are conditions that seem to leave no room\nfor either neglect or delay, so far as we are concerned. Delay is sin to\nus, and death to them.\"\n\nAnother minister of the South, whose services for the black man as well as\nthe white man, have been those of a philanthropist, has said, \"In our\nextremity we look to wise and just people in the Northern states to help\nus, to help both races; without Northern co\u00f6peration things will go from\nbad to worse.\" Yet the old hard word is still uttered by many and thought\nby many more, \"The negro is free, leave him to himself."}
{"ID": 420, "text": "The divine\n    possibilities of humanity, imaged in Jesus, revealed as our\n    inheritance and our prize.\n\n\nIt remains finally to emphasize the point of cardinal importance in the\nconsiderations that have been presented. This is not the reality of\nmiracles, but the reality of the supernatural, what it really is, as\ndistinct from what it has been thought to be. The advance of science and\nphilosophy has brought to the front this question: \"Have those who\nreject the claims of supernatural Religion been misinformed as to what\nit is?\" Is it, as they have been told, dependent for its attestation on\nsigns and wonders occurring in the sphere of the senses? Does it require\nacceptance of these, as well as of its teachings? Or is its\ncharacteristic appeal wholly to the higher nature of man, relying for\nits attestation on the witness borne to it by this, rather than by\nextraordinary phenomena presented to the senses? There is at present no\nintellectual interest of Christianity more urgent than this: to present\nto minds imbued with modern learning the true conception of the\nsupernatural and of supernatural Religion.\n\nMiracles, legitimately viewed as the natural product of extraordinary\npsychical power, or, to phrase it otherwise, of an exceptional vital\nendowment, belong not to the Hebrew race alone, nor did they cease when\nthe last survivor of the Jewish apostles of Christianity passed away at\nthe end of the first century. This traditional opinion ought by this\ntime to have been entombed together with its long defunct relative,\nwhich represented this globe as the fixed centre of the revolving\nheavens. Miracles have the same universality as human life. Nor will\ntheir record be closed till the evolution of life is complete. Animal\nlife, advancing through geologic \u00e6ons to the advent of man, in him\nreached its climax. Spiritual life, appearing in him as a new bud on an\nold stock, is evidently far from its climax still. To believe in\nmiracles, as rightly understood, is to believe in spirit and life, and\nin further unfoldings of their still latent powers.\n\nThis, however, is just now of subordinate importance. The present\ninterest of chief moment is a riddance of the hoary fallacy that\nvitiates the current idea of a supernatural Revelation by looking for\nits specific characteristics to the physical world."}

Never had he been\nso determined, and never so lovable.\n\nIt had been made abundantly plain to her that no wife, however exacting and adorable, should\never rob her, his mother, of one tittle of his old affection--nay, that, would she only accept\nKitty, only take the little forlorn creature into the shelter of her motherly arms, even a\nmore tender and devoted attention than before, on the part of her son, would be surely hers.\nHe spoke, moreover, the language of sound sense about his proposed bride. That he was in love,\npassionately in love, was evident; but there were moments when he could discuss Kitty, her\nfamily, her bringing-up, her gifts and defects, with the same cool acumen, the same detachment,\napparently, he might have given, say, to the Egyptian or the Balkan problem. Lady Tranmore\nwas not invited to bow before a divinity; she was asked to accept a very gifted and lovely\nchild, often troublesome and provoking, but full of a glorious promise which only persons of\ndiscernment, like herself and Ashe, could fully realize."}

The object of the Girl Scouts is to bring\nto all girls the opportunity for group experience, outdoor life, and to learn through work,\nbut more by play, to serve their community. Patterned after the Girl Guides of England, the\nsister organization of the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts has developed a method of self-government\nand a variety of activities that appear to be well suited to the desires of the girls as the\n60,000 registered Scouts and the 5,000 new applicants each month testify.\n\nActivities\n\nThe activities of the Girl Scouts may be grouped under five headings corresponding to five\nphases of women's life today:\n\n      I. The Home-maker.\n     II. The Producer.\n    III. The Consumer.\n     IV. The Citizen.\n      V. The Human Being.\n\nI. _Woman's most ancient way of service--the home-maker, the nurse, and the mother._ The program\nprovides incentives for practicing woman's world-old arts by requiring an elementary proficiency\nin cooking, housekeeping, first aid, and the rules of healthful living for any Girl Scout passing\nbeyond the Tenderfoot stage. Of the forty odd subjects for which Proficiency Badges are given,\nmore than one-fourth are in subjects directly related to the services of woman in the home,\nas mother, nurse or homekeeper. Into this work so often distasteful because solitary is brought\nthe sense of comradeship. This is effected partly by having much of the actual training done\nin groups. Another element is the public recognition, and rewarding of skill in this, woman's\nmost elementary service to the world, usually taken for granted and ignored.\n\nThe spirit of play infused into the simplest and most repetitious of household tasks banishes\ndrudgery. \"Give us, oh give us,\" says Carlyle, \"a man who sings at his work. He will do more\nin the same time, he will do it better, he will persevere longer. Wondrous is the strength\nof cheerfulness; altogether past comprehension its power of endurance.\"\n\nII. _Woman, the producer._ Handicrafts of many sorts enter into the program of the Girl Scouts.\nIn camping girls must know how to set up tents, build lean-tos, and construct fire-places.\nThey must also know how to make knots of various sorts to use for bandages, tying parcels,\nhitching, and so forth. Among the productive occupations in which Proficiency Badges are awarded\nare bee-keeping, dairying and general farming, gardening, weaving and needlework.\n\nIII. _Woman, the consumer._ One of the features in modern economics which is only beginning\nto be recognized is the fact that women form the consuming public. There are very few purchases,\neven for men's own use, which women do not have a hand in selecting. Practically the entire\nburden of household buying in all departments falls on the woman. In France this has long been\nrecognized and the women of the middle classes are the buying partners and bookkeepers in their\nhusbands' business. In America the test of a good husband is that he brings home his pay envelope\nunopened, a tacit recognition that the mother controls spending. The Girl Scouts encourage\nthrifty habits and learning economy of buying in all of its activities. One of the ten Scout\nLaws is that \"A Girl Scout is Thrifty.\"\n\nIV. _Woman, the citizen._ The basic organization of the Girl Scouts into the self-governing\nunit of a Patrol is in itself an excellent means of political training. Patrols and Troops\nconduct their own meetings and the Scouts learn the elements of parliamentary law. Working\ntogether in groups they realize the necessity for democratic decisions. They also come to have\ncommunity interests of an impersonal sort. This is perhaps the greatest single contribution\nof the Scouts toward the training of girls for citizenship. Little boys play together and not\nonly play together, but with men and boys of all ages. The interest of baseball is not confined\nto any one age. The rules of the game are the same for all, and the smallest boy's judgment\non the skill of the players may be as valid as that of the oldest fan. Girls have had in the\npast no such common interests. Their games have been either solitary or in very small groups\nin activities largely of a personal character. If women are to be effective in modern political\nsociety, they must have from very earliest youth gregarious interests and occupations.\n\nV. _Woman, the human being._ Political economy was for a long time known as the \"dead science\"\nand was quite ineffective socially. This was largely because it attempted to split man, the\nhuman being, into theoretical units such as \"the producer,\" or \"the consumer.\" In the same\nway many organizations for women have died because they have not remembered that woman is first\nof all a human being. Thus nearly all institutions for women, even those supposedly purely\neducational in character, have existed to shelter her from the world, or to segregate her,\nor have been designed to make her into a good servant or to \"finish\" her for society. The activities\nof the Girl Scouts have been selected on quite a different plan. They have not been designed\nfor women as women, but for women as human beings. Real work may be followed with a great deal\nof enjoyment provided it is creative and awakens the instinct of workmanship. But it is when\nat play that a human being realizes his own nature the most fully. So dancing, sports of all\nkinds, hiking, camping, boating, athletics and story-telling are encouraged not only as a means\nof recreation and for physical development, but are made a basic part of the Girl Scout program.\n\nMethods\n\nThe activities of the Girl Scouts are, of course, not peculiar to this organization. Every\none of them is provided for elsewhere, in schools, clubs, and societies. But the way in which\nthey are combined and co-ordinated about certain basic principles is peculiar to the Girl Scouts.\n\nIn the first place all these activities have a common motive which is preparation for a fuller\nlife for the individual, not only in her personal, but in her social relations. It is believed\nthat the habits formed and the concrete information acquired in these activities both contribute\nto the girls being ready to meet intelligently most of the situations that are likely to arise\nin their later life. This concept is expressed in the Girl Scouts Motto--\"Be Prepared.\"\n\nThe method of preparation followed is that found in nature whereby young animals and birds\n_play_ at doing all the things they will need to do well when they are grown and must feed\nand fend for themselves and their babies.\n\nTo play any game one must know the rules, so the Girl Scouts have Laws that they believe cover\nmost of the needs of the Game of Life.\n\n    The Girl Scouts Laws are ten:\n\n       I A Girl Scout's Honor is to be trusted.\n\n      II A Girl Scout is loyal.\n\n     III A Girl Scout's Duty is to be useful and to help others.\n\n      IV A Girl Scout is a friend to all, and a sister to every\n           other Girl Scout.\n\n       V A Girl Scout is Courteous.\n\n      VI A Girl Scout is a friend to Animals.\n\n     VII A Girl Scout obeys Orders.\n\n    VIII A Girl Scout is Cheerful.\n\n      IX A Girl Scout is Thrifty.\n\n       X A Girl Scout is Clean in Thought, Word and Deed.\n\nThese Laws are known by all Girl Scouts, but the _Promise_ to obey them is made only after\nthey are understood and voluntarily accepted. The Promise summarizes the Laws and is:\n\n          On My Honor, I Will Try:\n    To be true to God and my country\n    To help others at all times\n    To obey the Scout Laws\n\nThe heart of the Laws is helpfulness and so the Scouts have a _Slogan_: Do a Good Turn Daily.\nBy following this in letter and spirit helpfulness becomes second nature.\n\nBecause the Girl Scouts are citizens they know and respect the meaning of the flag, and one\nof the first things they learn is the Pledge:\n\nI pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible,\nwith Liberty and Justice for all.\n\n_Organization and Drill._ Some observers have criticized the Girl Scout organization because\nof its apparent military character. It is true that the girls wear a uniform of khaki, and\nare grouped in Patrols, corresponding to the \"fours\" in the Army; that they salute, and learn\nsimple forms of drill and signalling. But the reason they do this is because the military organization\nhappens to be the oldest form of organization in the world, and it works. It is the best way\nmen have found of getting a number of persons to work together. Following directions given\nto a group is quite a different matter from doing something alone, and most of us need special\ntraining in this. A group of eight has been found to work the best because it is the largest\nnumber that can be handled by a person just beginning to be a leader, and moreover elementary\nqualities of leadership seem to exist in just about the proportion of one in eight. It is probably\non this account that children take so kindly to the form--rather than because of any glamor\nof the army, though this must be admitted as a factor. In actual practice the drill and signalling\ntake up a very small portion of the program, and are nowhere followed as ends in themselves,\nbut only as a means to an end.\n\n_The Uniform._ The uniform is simple, durable and allows freedom of action. It is of khaki\nbecause this has been found to be the best wearing fabric and color. It is not easily torn\nand does not readily soil. Wearing it gives the girls a sense of belonging to a larger group,\nsuch as it is hard to get in any other way. It keeps constantly before them the fact that they\nrepresent a community to whose laws they have voluntarily subscribed and whose honor they uphold.\nIt is well, too, to have an _impersonal_ costume if for no other reason than to counteract\nthe tendency of girls to concentrate upon their personal appearance. To have a neat, simple,\nuseful garb is a novel experience to many an over-dressed doll who has been taught to measure\nall worth by extravagance of appearance.\n\nOrganization\n\n_Scouts of Different Ages._ The original Girl Scout program was designed mainly with the needs\nof the young adolescent in mind and the age was fixed from 10 to 18 years. But the little girls\nwanted to come in and so a separate division was made for them called the Brownies or Junior\nScouts. Then the older girls and women wanted to join and as time went on the original Girl\nScouts grew up, but not out of, the Scout movement, and programs are being made for Senior\nScouts who are eighteen and over. The three age groups seem to be natural ones and each has\nits own methods and activities. The larger number of Girl Scouts belong to the middle adolescent\ngroup.\n\nAll Scouts are organized in the same way and all are enrolled with the National Girl Scout\norganization.\n\n_Patrol._ Eight girls form a Patrol which is the working unit. The eight select from their\nown group a Patrol Leader who has charge of the activities for a month or any period of time\nthe Patrol may designate. The Patrol Leader has immediate responsibilities for the activities\nof the eight. It is desirable to have each girl of a Patrol serve as a leader at some time\nor other.\n\n_Troop._ One or more Patrols constitute a Troop which is the administrative unit recognized\nby the National organization.\n\n_Captain._ The Troop is under the direction of a Captain who must be at least twenty-one years\nof age and whose qualification as a leader of young girls is passed upon by National Headquarters\nbefore she is commissioned.\n\n_Lieutenant._ A Captain may have one or more Lieutenants. The Lieutenant must be at least eighteen\nyears of age and her commission is likewise subject to control by National Headquarters.\n\nCaptains and Lieutenants may be organized into associations in any given locality.\n\n_Scout Classes._ There are three classes of Girl Scouts, the youngest being the \"Tenderfoot,\"\nthe name given by frontiersmen to the man from the city who is not hardened to the rough life\nout of doors. Even the Tenderfoot, however, has to know _some_ things including the Promise,\nLaws, Slogan and Motto, how to salute, and the respect due to the flag, and making some useful\nknots.\n\nThe \"Second Class\" Scout has been a Tenderfoot for at least one month, and can pass a test\nof distinctly greater difficulty, including a good deal about cooking and housekeeping, animals\nand birds, flowers and trees, some important first aid things, and the laws of health.\n\nThe highest is the \"First Class\" Scout and is to be attained only by a young person of considerable\naccomplishment. She must be able to find her way about city or country without any of the usual\naids, using only the compass and her developed judgment of distance and direction. She must\nalso be able to communicate and receive messages in two ways--by signalling in Semaphore and\nthe General Service Codes which is the code used for telegraphing and wireless, and which can\nbe used in several ways. She must have shown proficiency in Home Nursing, Child Care, and Housekeeping\nand in addition in either Laundering, Cooking, Needlework or Gardening. She must also be an\nall round out doors person, familiar with camping, and able to lead in this, or be a good skater\nor a naturalist, or be able to swim. Not only must she know all these different things but\nshe must also have trained a Tenderfoot, and served her community.\n\n_Proficiency Badges._ After a Girl Scout has attained to First Class there are still other\nworlds to conquer as the badges she has earned on the way are only a few of the many kinds\nstill to be worked toward. There are at present no less than forty-six kinds of subjects in\nwhich a Scout may achieve, and more are being added daily. Just to mention a few: a Girl Scout\nmay be an Astronomer, a Bee keeper, a Dairy-maid, or a Dancer, an Electrician, a Geologist,\na Horsewoman, an Interpreter, a Motorist or a Musician, a Scribe, a Swimmer or accomplished\nin Thrift. Each subject has its own badge and when earned this is sewn into the uniform.\n\n_Council._ There may also be, and this is desirable, a Council composed of women and men representing\nall the best interests of the community: parents, schools, religious denominations of all sorts,\nbusiness, producers, women's clubs, and other social and philanthropic organizations. The Council\nacts as the link between the Girl Scouts and the community. It has the same relation to the\nseparate Troops that the school board has to the schools, that is; it guides and decides upon\npolicies and standards, interprets the Scouts to the community and the community to the Scouts.\nIt does not do the executive or teaching work--that belongs to the Captains, Lieutenants and\nPatrol Leaders.\n\nAnother of the functions of the Council is to interest public spirited women and men, particularly\nartists and scientists in Girl Scout work and get them to act as referees in awarding Merit\nBadges for proficiency in the many lines encouraged for Girl Scouts.\n\nBut the community's resources of wisdom are not only in the schools and museums, and laboratories\nand studios--these are mostly to be found only in large cities. It is a poor place that does\nnot have one or more wise old persons--a farmer learned in nature ways, a retired sailor stocked\nwith sea lore, or a mother of men who knows life as perhaps no one else can. The wise council\nwill know where to find these natural teachers and see that the children go to their schools.\n\nAnother prime function of the Council is the raising of funds and to make available such other\nmaterial equipment as camp sites, meeting places for the Troops, etc. The Captain should turn\nto the Council for help in arranging and directing rallies, dances, fairs, pageants and other\ndevices for entertainment or securing money.\n\n_National Organization._ The central governing body of the Girl Scouts is the National Council\nmade up of elected delegates from all local groups. The National Council works through an Executive\nBoard, which conducts National Headquarters in New York. The National Director is in charge\nof Headquarters and has direct administrative responsibility for the work of the whole organization\nwith the general divisions of Field, Business, Publication and Education.\n\n\"_Be Prepared_\"\n\n[Illustration: Girl Scout Logo]\n\nOfficers, National Headquarters Girl Scouts, Inc.\n\n  _Honorary President_\n  MRS.

{"ID": 752, "text": "As for his breath--the breath of cattle,\nyou know, is always sweet--it was as fragrant as if he had been grazing\non no other food than rosebuds, or, at least, the most delicate of\nclover blossoms. Never before did a bull have such bright and tender\neyes, and such smooth horns of ivory, as this one. And the bull ran\nlittle races, and capered sportively around the child; so that she quite\nforgot how big and strong he was, and, from the gentleness and\nplayfulness of his actions, soon came to consider him as innocent a\ncreature as a pet lamb.\n\nThus, frightened as she at first was, you might by and by have seen\nEuropa stroking the bull's forehead with her small white hand, and\ntaking the garlands off her own head to hang them on his neck and ivory\nhorns. Then she pulled up some blades of grass, and he ate them out of\nher hand, not as if he were hungry, but because he wanted to be friends\nwith the child, and took pleasure in eating what she had touched. Well,\nmy stars! was there ever such a gentle, sweet, pretty, and amiable\ncreature as this bull, and ever such a nice playmate for a little girl?\n\nWhen the animal saw (for the bull had so much intelligence that it is\nreally wonderful to think of), when he saw that Europa was no longer\nafraid of him, he grew overjoyed, and could hardly contain himself for\ndelight. He frisked about the meadow, now here, now there, making\nsprightly leaps, with as little effort as a bird expends in hopping from\ntwig to twig. Indeed, his motion was as light as if he were flying\nthrough the air, and his hoofs seemed hardly to leave their print in the\ngrassy soil over which he trod. With his spotless hue, he resembled a\nsnowdrift, wafted along by the wind. Once he galloped so far away that\nEuropa feared lest she might never see him again; so, setting up her\nchildish voice, she called him back.\n\n\"Come back, pretty creature!\" she cried. \"Here is a nice clover\nblossom.\"\n\nAnd then it was delightful to witness the gratitude of this amiable\nbull, and how he was so full of joy and thankfulness that he capered\nhigher than ever. He came running, and bowed his head before Europa, as\nif he knew her to be a king's daughter, or else recognised the important\ntruth that a little girl is everybody's queen. And not only did the bull\nbend his neck, he absolutely knelt down at her feet, and made such\nintelligent nods, and other inviting gestures, that Europa understood\nwhat he meant just as well as if he had put it in so many words."}
{"ID": 1679, "text": "One of his lamps is a pudding! Boss,\nI'll swear I ain't had nothin' to do with it.\"\n\n\"I don't like your society,\" said the Professor, \"and I'm going to\nturn you loose. I'm going to count ten, and if you're not out of\nthis quarry by then, I'll shoot. And if I see you again I'll skin\nyou alive. Now get out!\"\n\nHe cut the knotted handkerchief in two. The hobo needed no urging.\nHe spun on his heel and fled like a rabbit. The Professor watched\nhim go, and as the fat, ungainly figure burst through a hedge and\ndisappeared he fired the revolver into the air to frighten him still\nmore. Then he tossed the weapon into the pool near by.\n\n\"Well, Miss McGill,\" he said with a chuckle, \"if you like to\nundertake breakfast, I'll fix up Peg.\" And he drew the horse-shoe\nfrom his pocket once more.\n\nA brief inspection of Parnassus satisfied me that the thieves had\nnot had time to do any real damage. They had got out most of the\neatables and spread them on a flat rock in preparation for a feast;\nand they had tracked a good deal of mud into the van; but otherwise\nI could see nothing amiss. So while Mifflin busied himself with\nPeg's foot it was easy for me to get a meal under way. I found a\ngush of clean water trickling down the face of the rock. There were\nstill some eggs and bread and cheese in the little cupboard, and an\nunopened tin of condensed milk. I gave Peg her nose bag of oats, and\nfed Bock, who was frisking about in high spirits. By that time the\nshoeing was done, and the Professor and I sat down to an improvised\nmeal. I was beginning to feel as if this gipsy existence were the\nnormal course of my life.\n\n\"Well, Professor,\" I said, as I handed him a cup of coffee and a\nplate of scrambled eggs and cheese, \"for a man who slept in a wet\nhaystack, you acquit yourself with excellent valour.\"\n\n\"Old Parnassus is quite a stormy petrel,\" he said. \"I used to think\nthe chief difficulty in writing a book would be to invent things to\nhappen, but if I were to sit down and write the adventures I'd had\nwith her it would be a regular Odyssey.\"\n\n\"How about Peg's foot?\" I asked. \"Can she travel on it?\"\n\n\"It'll be all right if you go easy. I've scraped out the injured\npart and put the shoe back. I keep a little kit of tools under the\nvan for emergencies of all sorts.\"\n\nIt was chilly, and we didn't dawdle over our meal. I only made a\nfeint of eating, as I had had a little breakfast before, and also\nas the events of the last few hours had left me rather restless. I\nwanted to get Parnassus out on the highway again, to jog along in\nthe sun and think things over. The quarry was a desolate, forbidding\nplace anyway. But before we left we explored the cave where the\ntramps had been preparing to make themselves comfortable for the\nwinter. It was not really a cave, but only a shaft into the granite\ncliff. A screen of evergreen boughs protected the opening against\nthe weather, and inside were piles of sacking that had evidently\nbeen used as beds, and many old grocery boxes for tables and chairs.\nIt amused me to notice a cracked fragment of mirror balanced on a\ncorner of rock. Even these ragamuffins apparently were not totally\nunconscious of personal appearance. I seized the opportunity, while\nthe Professor was giving Peg's foot a final look, to rearrange my\nhair, which was emphatically a sight. I hardly think Andrew would\nhave recognized me that morning.\n\nWe led Peg up the steep incline, back into the lane where I had\nstrayed, and at length we reached the main road again. Here I began\nto lay down the law to Redbeard.\n\n\"Now look here, Professor,\" I said, \"I'm not going to have you tramp\nall the way back to Port Vigor. After the night you've had you need\na rest. You just climb into that Parnassus and lie down for a good\nsnooze. I'll drive you into Woodbridge and you can take your train\nthere. Now you get right into that bunk. I'll sit out here and drive.\"\n\nHe demurred, but without much emphasis. I think the little fool was\njust about fagged out, and no wonder. I was a trifle groggy myself.\nIn the end he was quite docile. He climbed into the van, took off\nhis boots, and lay down under a blanket. Bock followed him, and I\nthink they both fell asleep on the instant. I got on the front seat\nand took the reins. I didn't let Peg go more quickly than a walk as\nI wanted to spare her sore foot.\n\nMy, what a morning that was after the rain! The road ran pretty\nclose to the shore, and every now and then I could catch a glimpse\nof the water. The air was keen--not just the ordinary, unnoticed air\nthat we breathe in and out and don't think about, but a sharp and\ntingling essence, as strong in the nostrils as camphor or ammonia.\nThe sun seemed focussed upon Parnassus, and we moved along the white\nroad in a flush of golden light. The flat fronds of the cedars\nswayed gently in the salty air, and for the first time in ten\nyears, I should think, I began amusing myself by selecting words to\ndescribe the goodness of the morning. I even imagined myself writing\na description of it, as if I were Andrew or Thoreau. The crazy\nlittle Professor had inoculated me with his literary bug, I guess.\n\nAnd then I did a dishonourable thing. Just by chance I put my hand\ninto the little pocket beside the seat where Mifflin kept a few odds\nand ends. I meant to have another look at that card of his with the\npoem on it. And there I found a funny, battered little notebook,\nevidently forgotten. On the cover was written, in ink, \"Thoughts\non the Present Discontents.\" That title seemed vaguely familiar. I\nseemed to recall something of the kind from my school days--more\nthan twenty years ago, goodness me! Of course if I had been\nhonourable I wouldn't have looked into it. But in a kind of\nquibbling self-justification I recalled that I had bought Parnassus\nand all it contained, \"lock, stock, barrel and bung\" as Andrew used\nto say. And so....\n\nThe notebook was full of little jottings, written in pencil in\nthe Professor's small, precise hand. The words were rubbed\nand soiled, but plainly legible. I read this:\n\n\nI don't suppose Bock or Peg get lonely, but by the bones of Ben\nGunn, I do. Seems silly when Herrick and Hans Andersen and Tennyson\nand Thoreau and a whole wagonload of other good fellows are riding\nat my back. I can hear them all talking as we trundle along. But\nbooks aren't a _substantial_ world after all, and every now and then\nwe get hungry for some closer, more human relationships. I've been\ntotally alone now for eight years--except for Runt, and he might be\ndead and never say so. This wandering about is fine in its way, but\nit must come to an end some day. A man needs to put down a root\nsomewhere to be really happy.\n\nWhat absurd victims of contrary desires we are! If a man is settled\nin one place he yearns to wander; when he wanders he yearns to have\na home. And yet how bestial is content--all the great things in life\nare done by discontented people.\n\nThere are three ingredients in the good life: learning, earning,\nand yearning. A man should be learning as he goes; and he should\nbe earning bread for himself and others; and he should be yearning,\ntoo: yearning to know the unknowable.\n\nWhat a fine old poem is \"The Pulley\" by George Herbert! Those\nElizabethan fellows knew how to write! They were marred perhaps by\ntheir idea that poems must be \"witty.\" (Remember how Bacon said\nthat reading poets makes one witty? There he gave a clue to the\nliterature of his time.)  Their fantastic puns and conceits are\nrather out of our fashion nowadays. But Lord! the root of the\nmatter was in them! How gallantly, how reverently, they tackle the\nproblems of life!\n\nWhen God at first made man (says George Herbert) He had a \"glass of\nblessings standing by.\" So He pours on man all the blessings in His\nreservoir: strength, beauty, wisdom, honour, pleasure--and then He\nrefrains from giving him the last of them, which is rest, i.e.,\ncontentment. God sees that if man is contented he will never win\nhis way to Him. Let man be restless, so that\n\n  \"If goodness lead him not, yet weariness\n     May toss him to My breast.\"\n\nSome day I shall write a novel on that theme, and call it \"The\nPulley.\" In this tragic, restless world there must be some\nplace where at last we can lay our heads and be at rest. Some\npeople call it death. Some call it God.\n\nMy ideal of a man is not the Omar who wants to shatter into bits\nthis sorry scheme of things, and then remould it nearer to the\nheart's desire. Old Omar was a coward, with his silk pajamas and\nhis glass of wine. The real man is George Herbert's \"seasoned\ntimber\"--the fellow who does handily and well whatever comes to him.\nEven if it's only shovelling coal into a furnace he can balance the\nshovel neatly, swing the coal square on the fire and not spill it on\nthe floor. If it's only splitting kindling or running a trolley car\nhe can make a good, artistic job of it. If it's only writing a book\nor peeling potatoes he can put into it the best he has. Even if he's\nonly a bald-headed old fool over forty selling books on a country\nroad, he can make an ideal of it. Good old Parnassus! It's a great\ngame.... I think I'll have to give her up soon, though: I must get\nthat book of mine written. But Parnassus has been a true glass of\nblessings to me.\n\n\nThere was much more in the notebook; indeed it was half full of\njotted paragraphs, memoranda, and scraps of writing--poems I believe\nsome of them were--but I had seen enough. It seemed as if I had\nstumbled unawares on the pathetic, brave, and lonely heart of the\nlittle man. I'm a commonplace creature, I'm afraid, insensible to\nmany of the deeper things in life, but every now and then, like all\nof us, I come face to face with something that thrills me. I saw how\nthis little, red-bearded pedlar was like a cake of yeast in the big,\nheavy dough of humanity: how he travelled about trying to fulfil in\nhis own way his ideals of beauty. I felt almost motherly toward him:\nI wanted to tell him that I understood him. And in a way I felt\nashamed of having run away from my own homely tasks, my kitchen and\nmy hen yard and dear old, hot-tempered, absent-minded Andrew. I\nfell into a sober mood. As soon as I was alone, I thought, I would\nsell Parnassus and hurry back to the farm. That was my job, that\nwas my glass of blessings. What was I doing--a fat, middle-aged\nwoman--trapesing along the roads with a cartload of books I didn't\nunderstand?\n\nI slipped the little notebook back into its hiding-place. I would\nhave died rather than let the Professor know I had seen it.\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n\nWe were coming into Woodbridge; and I was just wondering whether to\nwake the Professor when the little window behind me slid back and he\nstuck his head out.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said. \"I think I must have been asleep!\"\n\n\"Well, I should hope so,\" I said. \"You needed it.\"\n\nIndeed he looked much better, and I was relieved to see it. I had\nbeen really afraid he would be ill after sleeping out all night, but\nI guess he was tougher than I thought. He joined me on the seat, and\nwe drove into the town. While he went to the station to ask about\nthe trains I had a fine time selling books. I was away from the\nlocality where I was known, and had no shyness in attempting to\nimitate Mifflin's methods. I even went him one better by going into\na hardware store where I bought a large dinner bell. This I rang\nlustily until a crowd gathered, then I put up the flaps and\ndisplayed my books. As a matter of fact, I sold only one, but I\nenjoyed myself none the less.\n\nBy and by Mifflin reappeared. I think he had been to a barber: at\nany rate he looked very spry: he had bought a clean collar and a\nflowing tie of a bright electric blue which really suited him rather\nwell.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"the Sage is going to get back at me for that\npunch on the nose! I've been to the bank to cash your check. They\ntelephoned over to Redfield, and apparently your brother has stopped\npayment on it. It's rather awkward: they seem to think I'm a crook.\"\n\nI was furious. What right had Andrew to do that?\n\n\"The brute!\" I said. \"What on earth shall I do?\"\n\n\"I suggest that you telephone to the Redfield Bank,\" he said, \"and\ncountermand your brother's instructions--that is, unless you think\nyou've made a mistake? I don't want to take advantage of you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said. \"I'm not going to let Andrew spoil my holiday.\nThat's always his way: if he gets an idea into his head he's like a\nmule. I'll telephone to Redfield, and then we'll go to see the bank\nhere.\"\n\nWe put Parnassus up at the hotel, and I went to the telephone. I was\nthoroughly angry at Andrew, and tried to get him on the wire first.\nBut Sabine Farm didn't answer. Then I telephoned to the bank in\nRedfield, and got Mr. Shirley. He's the cashier, and I know him\nwell. I guess he recognized my voice, for he made no objection when\nI told him what I wanted.\n\n\"Now you telephone to the bank in Woodbridge,\" I said, \"and tell\nthem to let Mr. Mifflin have the money. I'll go there with him to\nidentify him. Will that be all right?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" he said. The deceitful little snail! If I had only\nknown what he was concocting!\n\nMifflin said there was a train at three o'clock which he could take.\nWe stopped at a little lunch room for a bite to eat, then he went\nagain to the bank, and I with him. We asked the cashier whether they\nhad had a message from Redfield.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"We've just heard.\" And he looked at me rather\nqueerly.\n\n\"Are you Miss McGill?\" he said.\n\n\"I am,\" I said.\n\n\"Will you just step this way a moment?\" he asked politely.\n\nHe led me into a little sitting-room and asked me to sit down. I\nsupposed that he was going to get some paper for me to sign, so I\nwaited quite patiently for several minutes. I had left the Professor\nat the cashier's window, where they would give him his money.\n\nI waited some time, and finally I got tired of looking at the Life\nInsurance calendars. Then I happened to glance out of the window.\nSurely that was the Professor, just disappearing round the corner\nwith another man?\n\nI returned to the cashier's desk.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I said. \"Your mahogany furniture is charming,\nbut I'm tired of it. Do I have to sit here any longer? And where's\nMr. Mifflin? Did he get his money?\"\n\nThe cashier was a horrid little creature with side whiskers.\n\n\"I'm sorry you had to wait, Madam,\" he said. \"The transaction is\njust concluded. We gave Mr. Mifflin what was due him. There is no\nneed for you to stay longer.\"\n\nI thought this was very extraordinary. Surely the Professor would\nnot leave without saying good-bye? However, I noticed that the clock\nsaid three minutes to three, so I thought that perhaps he had had to\nrun to catch his train. He was such a strange little man, anyway....\n\nWell, I went back to the hotel, quite a little upset by this sudden\nparting. At least I was glad the little man had got his money all\nright. Probably he would write from Brooklyn, but of course I\nwouldn't get the letter till I returned to the farm as that was the\nonly address he would have. Perhaps that wouldn't be so long after\nall: but I did not feel like going back now, when Andrew had been\nso horrid.\n\nI drove Parnassus on the ferry, and we crossed the river. I felt\nlost and disagreeable. Even the fresh movement through the air\ngave me no pleasure. Bock whined dismally inside the van.\n\nIt didn't take me long to discover that Parnassing all alone had\nlost some of its charms. I missed the Professor: missed his abrupt,\ndirect way of saying things, and his whimsical wit. And I was\nannoyed by his skipping off without a word of good-bye. It didn't\nseem natural. I partially appeased my irritation by stopping at a\nfarmhouse on the other side of the river and selling a cook book.\nThen I started along the road for Bath--about five miles farther on.\nPeg's foot didn't seem to bother her so I thought it would be safe\nto travel that far before stopping for the night. Counting up the\ndays (with some difficulty: it seemed as though I had been away from\nhome a month), I remembered that this was Saturday night. I thought\nI would stay in Bath over Sunday and get a good rest. We jogged\nsedately along the road, and I got out a copy of \"Vanity Fair.\" I\nwas so absorbed in Becky Sharp that I wouldn't even interrupt myself\nto sell books at the houses we passed. I think reading a good book\nmakes one modest. When you see the marvellous insight into human\nnature which a truly great book shows, it is bound to make you feel\nsmall--like looking at the Dipper on a clear night, or seeing the\nwinter sunrise when you go out to collect the morning eggs. And\nanything that makes you feel small is mighty good for you.\n\n\"What do you mean by a great book?\" said the Professor--I mean,\nI imagined him saying it. It seemed to me as if I could see him\nsitting there, with his corncob pipe in his hand and that quizzical\nlittle face of his looking sharply at me. Somehow, talking with\nthe Professor had made me think. He was as good as one of those\nScranton correspondence courses, I do believe, and no money to pay\nfor postage.\n\nWell, I said to the Professor--to myself I mean--let's see: what\n_is_ a good book? I don't mean books like Henry James's (he's\nAndrew's great idol. It always seemed to me that he had a kind\nof rush of words to the head and never stopped to sort them out\nproperly). A good book ought to have something simple about it. And,\nlike Eve, it ought to come from somewhere near the third rib: there\nought to be a heart beating in it. A story that's all forehead\ndoesn't amount to much. Anyway, it'll never get over at a Dorcas\nmeeting."}

Meantime,\na poor lion, once a great favourite, which was thought to be connected with the lions on the\nEnglish colours, was placed in a bamboo cage in sight of the prisoners, and there starved to\ndeath, in hopes of thus abating the force of the enemy.  When its carcase was removed, Mr.\nJudson, at his own earnest entreaty, was allowed the reversion of its cage, and there, to his\ngreat joy, Moung Ing brought him his MS. translation of part of the Burmese Bible, which he\nhad kept in his pillow at Ava till it was torn away by the jailors on his removal. The faithful\nIng, thinking only to secure a relic of his master, had picked up the pillow and secured the\ntreasure.\n\nSolitude was the greatest boon to Judson, whose fastidious delicacy suffered greatly in the\nthronged prison, but his faithful Ann was suffering terribly.

Poor little Maria was nearly starved, no milk was to be had,\nand the only food she obtained was when the jailers were bribed to let her father carry her\nround the village to beg a little nourishment from the nursing mothers.  Her moans at night\nrent the heart of her sick mother, and it is scarcely possible to imagine how either survived.\nBy this time, the English troops were so far advancing that the King was reduced to negotiate,\nand, being in need of an interpreter, he sent an order for Mr. Judson's release; but as his\nwife was not named in it, she had great difficulty in effecting her departure, and half-way\nthrough the journey a guard came down and carried him off to Ava without her.

{"ID": 95, "text": "The Emperor complimented me, expressing regret that I was not in his service earlier as he would have made me a Prince and Marshal. As he fell into a reverie, I understood he believed I could have saved his fortunes. After coffee, we discussed politics before he left me.\n\nDespite the busy war efforts, I took the time to pen a few pages of my memoirs as a gesture of gratitude. During the siege, I encountered Mr. Toone O'Connor Emmett Fitzgerald Sheeny, a representative of an English journal. He posed as a Christino officer with the payment of two guineas per week for his duties. In a sortie, I saved him from being slaughtered by my own men, as they did not recognize him as a civilian. Afterwards, he offered his belongings to my troops to avoid any further conflict.\n\nAlthough it may seem long-winded, I explained the situation to illustrate how I saved Mr. Sheeny and prevented further bloodshed.I discovered three English sovereigns and a copy of the New Monthly Magazine on Mr. Sheeny's person, which I still possess. His possession of my adventures, as published in the magazine, resulted in my decision to spare his life instead of letting him be executed. I accepted his portmanteau and valuable possessions in exchange for his freedom, and placed the magazine in my coat pocket before departing from the podesta. As we retreated from Oraa's lines, I found myself in the midst of advancing Queenite lancers and our own retreating column, causing me to run away from the danger rather than fight. As I fled, I faced several near-death experiences, including two combats with lancers. In the second encounter, I threw the portmanteau at the lancer's head, stole the horse, but forgot to take my sword with me. To my dismay, the lancer chased me and ultimately pierced my back with his lance, entering through numerous pages of the magazine.If it hadn't been for the Magazine, I would have surely been impaled. Was it wrong for me to feel grateful? I had every reason to continue contributing to the journal. Upon arriving safely in Morella with the rest of the party, I learned of the comical outcome of the lancer's thrust. While the man had mobilized his lance, a ball had arrived from our troops and hit him in the nose, putting an end to his lancing attempts. I immediately made my way to Cabrera's quarter and recounted my adventures of the day.\n\nDuring our conversation, Cabrera noticed I was still standing and urged me to take a seat. It was then that I discovered a foreign object in the tail of my coat. Upon pulling it out, I found the Christino lance twisted up like a fish hook or a pastoral crook. The group erupted in laughter when I presented it. However, their amusement turned to amazement when I revealed the Magazine had saved me from the lance.\n\nI read my story to them in Spanish, and they were eager to hear more. During our evening tertullia (sangaree), I continued my account, picking up where I had left off in the battle of Delhi. Although the British Army ultimately triumphed, Lord Lake gained all the credit for the victory, despite my contributions.\n\nAs we marched to Delhi, Shah Allum bestowed me with the title Gujputi, meaning 'lord of elephants'. The women had a softer name for me, calling me 'Mushook' or charmer. I spared the readers a description of the city but recounted the siege of Agra and the battle of Laswaree, where we emerged victorious, and I was wounded.\n\nThe campaign revealed the need to address my status in the army since the locals knew of my accomplishments while the sepoys and King's army grumbled that I was still a mere lieutenant. Lord Wellesley was in a predicament trying to figure out what to do about it.He wrote to Gahagan, informing him that being a subaltern was not his destiny, as he was born to lead. However, Lake and General Wellesley were exceptional officers who couldn't be replaced easily. Therefore, he decided to create a new position for him as the commander of a corps of irregular horse. This marked the beginning of the famous Ahmednuggar Irregulars, a guerilla force that left its mark in the history of Indian campaigns.\n\nAs the regiment's commander, he was responsible for the recruitment process and developing the uniform. The response was overwhelming, with the irregulars flocking to his standard at a faster rate than the regular corps in the Company's service. The troops were mostly natives belonging to the strongest and bravest territories in India, including Pitans, Afghans, Hurrumzadehs, and Calliawns.\n\nOn parade and adorned in the most splendid costumes a soldier could ever wear, the regiment made an unforgettable appearance. He had a love for dress and designed a magnificent costume that complemented his six-foot-four height, amazing symmetry, and proportion. He had auburn hair and beard with a shade so bright it could be mistaken for scarlet. His bright blue eyes were overshadowed by bushy brows and a terrific gash that went over his forehead, eyelid, and cheek, which gave him a strict military look even after drinking.\n\nDuring the hot winds at Chittybobbary, he allowed his hair to grow long, taking two hours daily to curl the ten thousand little ringlets that waved over his shoulders. He dressed in loose scarlet trousers and red morocco boots, while his officers and men wore similar costumes but in different colours.\n\nThe regiment comprised ferocious looking men, frightening more than any ruffians he had ever seen. He considered himself fortunate to have led such a group of fearless warriors. Even after twenty years, he could hear the booming of their war cry and mark the glitter of their scimitars as they raged in the thickest of the battle.\n\nHe wished he could reunite with his old Ahmednuggars on a fair field again, preferably to fight against the Czar of Muscovy if he passed through Cabool and Lahore."}

Many things may we\nwrite that were done in this same year.  So it was in Denmark, that the Danes, a nation that\nwas formerly accounted the truest of all, were turned aside to the greatest untruth, and to\nthe greatest treachery that ever could be.  They chose and bowed to King Cnute, and swore him\noaths, and afterwards dastardly slew him in a church.  It happened also in Spain, that the\nheathens went and made inroads upon the Christians, and reduced much of the country to their\ndominion.  But the king of the Christians, Alphonzo by name, sent everywhere into each land,\nand desired assistance.  And they came to his support from every land that was Christian; and\nthey went and slew or drove away all the heathen folk, and won their land again, through God's\nassistance.  In this land also, in the same year, died many rich men; Stigand, Bishop of Chichester,\nand the Abbot of St. Augustine, and the Abbot of Bath, and the Abbot of Pershore, and the lord\nof them all, William, King of England, that we spoke of before."}
{"ID": 74, "text": "VOLP: What's this disturbance, Mosca?\n\nMOS: Your visitor, Corvino, has arrived with a lady.\n\nVOLP: What lady, pray tell?\n\nMOS: It is his wife, Celia, whom he wishes to present to you.\n\nVOLP: I have no interest in seeing her. Get rid of them both.\n\nMOS: As you wish. [to Corvino and Celia] My master is not feeling well today, perhaps another time would be more appropriate.\n\nCORV: But I have a special favor to ask of him.\n\nVOLP: [sighs] What is your request, Corvino?\n\nCORV: My wife has been unfaithful to me, and I wish for you to prove her guilt.\n\nVOLP: [laughing] You come to me for this? I am no private investigator.\n\nCORV: I will pay you handsomely for your services.\n\nVOLP: [smiling] In that case, perhaps we can come to an arrangement.\n\nMOS: [whispering to Volpone] I have a feeling this will be quite profitable for us.\n\nVOLP: [whispering back] Agreed. Let us make the most of this opportunity.\n\n[The scene ends with Volpone and Mosca plotting their scheme.]I must do it and I won't back down because I want to avoid any deceit that might cause me to lose what I desire. Celio, please don't subject me to these bizarre tests. If you question my fidelity, lock me up forever or treat me as if I'm the heir of darkness. I will live where I only please your fears, if not your trust. Believe me, I'm not insane or irrational. Listen to me and be a good wife. \n\nOh god! What kind of spirit has possessed him? And for your reputation, it's absurd to think that I would reveal it to anyone besides someone who cannot speak or this man whose lips I control. You can save yourself by proclaiming it, but who else will know? What about heaven and saints? Will they be indifferent or ignorant? \n\nIf I thought it was a sin, I wouldn't urge you. If I offered this to some young, lustful man who knew every trick in the book of lechery, it would be a sin. But this is different. It's a noble cause, charity for medicine and honest politics, to ensure my own health. \n\nOh god! How can you let this happen? You are my honor, Mosca, and my pride, joy, tickle, and delight! Bring them in. \n\nPlease come nearer, sir. Signior Corvino has come to see you and offer his wife, the most beautiful and valuable woman in Venice, as a comfort and to preserve you. \n\nThank you, sweet Mosca. You can tell him what I've done for him, but it's a pointless battle against heaven. My state is hopeless. Ask him to pray for me and to use his fortune wisely. \n\nDo you hear, sir? Go to him with your wife. \n\nHeart of my father! Will you persist like this? Please come, Celia. By this hand, I'll become violent. Come on, do it. I will drag you home by the hair, proclaim you as a prostitute in the streets, rip your mouth to your ears, and slit your nose like a raw rotchet. Don't tempt me. Yield, or I'll kill you. I'll bind you to a slave and hang you out my window while devising some monstrous crime to etch into your flesh with chemicals. I'll do it by the blood you've incensed.CEL: Sir, I will not be won with jewels or riches. Your advances towards me are disgraceful and dishonest. How can you speak of love while also advocating for infidelity and theft? Have you no respect for the sanctity of marriage and loyalty? Your actions only prove that you do not understand or value true love. While I may have found no deserving partner in my husband, I will not lower myself to your level of immorality. Your gifts and promises mean nothing to me, as they are built on a foundation of deceit and greed. Leave me be before I expose your true nature to the world.CEL: Kind sir, these things may appeal to someone who is swayed easily by such pleasures. But for me, my innocence is all that I value and it is not something that can be bought with worldly pleasures. Once lost, it cannot be regained hence I am not tempted by these fleeting pleasures. If you have a conscience VOLP: It's a virtue of the poor. If you are wise, hear me, Celia. Let us indulge in luxurious baths of July flowers, rose and violet extracts, the milk of unicorns, and breath of panthers, combined with Cretan wines. We shall drink prepared gold and amber until the room spins with vertigo. My dwarf shall dance, my eunuch will sing, and my fool shall entertain us with antics. We shall enact tales from Ovid, transforming ourselves into Europa and Jove, Mars and Erycine, and others until we have exhausted all tales of gods. Then we shall assume more modern roles such as being French or Tuscan ladies, Spanish beauties or wives of Persian sophie or grand signior. We shall even be city courtesans, quick Negros or cold Russians. And through all these transformation, we shall experience endless pleasure that cannot be comprehended by others. [SINGS] The curious shall not be able to keep up, and the envious shall remain pined\u2026 CEL: If your ears can listen, your eyes can see, your heart can feel, or any part of you is still humane, then have mercy on me and let me go. If you possess the touch of holy saints or heaven, please have mercy on me. If not, kindly take your wrath out on me instead of your lust (which does not befit a man). Punish me for the crime of seducing you with my supposed beauty, flay my face, or even poison it to temper your rebellious blood. Nonetheless, spare my honor. I will kneel down to you, pray for you, and pay hourly vows to you for your health. VOLP: Are you going to regard me as a virtuous man? Do you think me impotent now\u2026or cold? If I had Nestor's hernia, would you think me so? I have been waiting for this moment for too long instead of acting on my desire. You shall yield to me, or I shall take it from you by force. [He seizes her.] CEL: O, just God! VOLP: It's too late. BON [RUSHING IN]: Stop, you rapist, lustful pig! Release the kidnapped lady, or you will die, hypocrite. I am hesitant to take revenge on my own hence let justice punish you. Lady, let us leave this place, it is the abode of immorality. Fear not, you have a guardian who will protect you, and this man will face judgment soon. [They exit.] VOLP: May the roof fall upon me and bury me! O, shelter that I thought was my own! I have been exposed, ruined, beggared, and my idol has been seized. [MOSCA, WOUNDED AND BLEEDING ENTERS.] MOS: Where shall I go to end my misery, the disgrace to men? Should I beat out my brains as penance? VOLP: Here, here. Are you bleeding? MOS: I wish his sword was courteous enough to cleave me from navel to chin before I lived to witness all my hopes, patron, and life in ruins due to my errors. VOLP: Woe upon your misfortune! MOS: And upon my foolishness, sir. I did not expect him to heed the temptation. VOLP: What do we do now? MOS: I do not know, sir. If my death could atone for my mistake, I would do it willingly. Will you please hang me or slit my throat, and I will repay you, sir? Let us die like brave Romans since we have lived like weak Greeks. [KNOCKING WITHIN.] VOLP: Who's there?As we walk along this street, sir, I must point out that this incident proves the importance of observation. You mentioned that you wanted some instructions, so here are some key details that are specific to this city.I won't insult you by criticizing your clothes or language, as they are outdated. \n\nSorry, let me rephrase that. I was referring to them as potential conversation topics. \n\nPlease continue with your advice, I won't make any more comments. \n\nFirst, your attire should be serious and reserved, never revealing any secrets to anyone, not even your father. Choose your company and words carefully and never speak the truth to strangers. \n\nAs for religion, do not profess any but instead marvel at the diversity of all beliefs. Declare that you would be content with simply following the laws of the land. Machiavelli and Bodin both shared this perspective. \n\nYou must also know how to use a silver fork and understand the importance of certain mealtime etiquettes with your Italian acquaintances. \n\nWhy yes, the timing of eating melons and figs is indeed a matter of state importance. As a Venetian, one must be aware of any perceived impropriety and correct it immediately. \n\nI have been living in Venice for fourteen months now and I've been mistaken for a Venetian citizen due to my knowledge of their customs. If I could find one person I could trust, I would make them rich with certain projects that I have in mind. \n\nOne of my projects involves supplying the state of Venice with red herrings from Rotterdam for three years at a certain rate. I've received a letter about it from one of the states, signed with the sender's mark as they cannot write their name. \n\nI have other projects in mind as well, which I hope to propose to the Great Council, the Forty and then the Ten, with the aim of receiving a pension. \n\nMy means have been secured by a commandador who can sway opinions in important meetings. \n\nI have notes on my projects but I need you to swear on your honor not to reveal any details and to prevent any anticipation. \n\nOne of my proposals involves regulating the use of tinderboxes, ensuring that only known patriots and lovers of their country possess them, with the boxes sealed at an office and at a certain size to prevent them from being carried in pockets.Sir Politick is discussing an innovative method for determining whether a ship arriving from Soria or any part of the Levant carrying the plague. He plans to use onions to attract the infection and bellows to blow the air, which will cause the onions' color to change if contagion is present. Sir Politick admits that he has recorded every detail of his life in his diary, which contains a note about buying toothpicks and urinating at St. Mark's. Lady Politick would be arrives with Nano and two waiting women. Sir Politick introduces Lady Politick to a gentleman and commends her beauty and behavior.

{"ID": 567, "text": "Our dinner cost us 6s., and so my wife and I away to Islington, it being a\nfine day, and thence to Sir G. Whitmore's house, where we 'light, and\nwalked over the fields to Kingsland, and back again; a walk, I think, I\nhave not taken these twenty years; but puts me in mind of my boy's time,\nwhen I boarded at Kingsland, and used to shoot with my bow and arrows in\nthese fields.  A very pretty place it is; and little did any of my friends\nthink I should come to walk in these fields in this condition and state\nthat I am.  Then took coach again, and home through Shoreditch; and at\nhome my wife finds Barker to have been abroad, and telling her so many\nlies about it, that she struck her, and the wench said she would not stay\nwith her: so I examined the wench, and found her in so many lies myself,\nthat I was glad to be rid of her, and so resolved having her go away\nto-morrow.  So my wife and W. Hewer and I to supper, and then he and I to\nmy chamber to begin the draught of the report from this office to the Duke\nof York in the case of Mr. Carcasse, which I sat up till midnight to do,\nand then to bed, believing it necessary to have it done, and to do it\nplainly, for it is not to be endured the trouble that this rascal hath put\nus to, and the disgrace he hath brought upon this office.\n\n13th.  Up, and when ready, to the office (my wife rising to send away\nBarker, according to our resolution last night, and she did do it with\nmore clothes than have cost us L10, and 20s. in her purse, which I did for\nthe respect I bear Mr. Falconbridge, otherwise she had not deserved half\nof it, but I am the more willing to do it to be rid of one that made work\nand trouble in the house, and had not qualities of any honour or pleasure\nto me or my family, but what is a strange thing did always declare to her\nmistress and others that she had rather be put to drudgery and to wash the\nhouse than to live as she did like a gentlewoman), and there I and Gibson\nall the morning making an end of my report against Carcasse, which I think\nwill do our business, but it is a horrid shame such a rogue should give me\nand all of us this trouble.  This morning come Sir H. Cholmly to me for a\ntally or two; and tells me that he hears that we are by agreement to give\nthe King of France Nova Scotia, which he do not like: but I do not know\nthe importance of it.\n\n     [Nova Scotia and the adjoining countries were called by the French\n     Acadie.  Pepys is not the only official personage whose ignorance of\n     Nova Scotia is on record.  A story is current of a prime minister\n     (Duke of Newcastle) who was surprised at hearing Cape Breton was an\n     island.  \"Egad, I'll go tell the King Cape Breton is an island!\"\n     Of the same it is said, that when told Annapolis was in danger, and\n     ought to be defended: \"Oh! certainly Annapolis must be defended,--\n     where is Annapolis?\"--B.]\n\nThen abroad with my wife to my Lord Treasurer's, and she to her tailor's.\nI find Sir Philip Warwicke, who I perceive do give over my Lord Treasurer\nfor a man of this world, his pain being grown great again upon him, and\nall the rest he hath is by narcotiques, and now Sir Philip Warwicke do\nplease himself, like a good man, to tell some of the good ejaculations of\nmy Lord Treasurer concerning the little worth of this world, to buy it\nwith so much pain, and other things fit for a dying man.  So finding no\nbusiness likely to be done here for Tangier, I having a warrant for\ntallies to be signed, I away to the New Exchange, and there staid a\nlittle, and then to a looking-glass shop to consult about covering the\nwall in my closet over my chimney, which is darkish, with looking-glasses,\nand then to my wife's tailor's, but find her not ready to go home, but got\nto buy things, and so I away home to look after my business and finish my\nreport of Carcasse, and then did get Sir W. Batten, Sir J. Minnes, and\n[Sir] W. Pen together, and read it over with all the many papers relating\nto the business, which they do wonder at, and the trouble I have taken\nabout it, and like the report, so as that they do unanimously resolve to\nsign it, and stand by it, and after a great deal of discourse of the\nstrange deportment of my Lord Bruncker in this business to withstand the\nwhole board in behalf of such an impudent rogue as this is, I parted, and\nhome to my wife, and supped and talked with her, and then to bed,\nresolving to rise betimes to-morrow to write fair the report.\n\n14th.  Up by 5 o'clock, and when ready down to my chamber, and there with\nMr. Fist, Sir W. Batten's clerk, who writes mighty well, writing over our\nreport in Mr. Carcasses business, in which we continued till 9 o'clock,\nthat the office met, and then to the office, where all the morning, and so\nat noon home to dinner, where Mr. Holliard come and eat with us, who among\nother things do give me good hopes that we shall give my father some ease\nas to his rupture when he comes to town, which I expect to-morrow.  After\ndinner comes Fist, and he and I to our report again till 9 o'clock, and\nthen by coach to my Lord Chancellor's, where I met Mr. Povy, expecting the\ncoming of the rest of the Commissioners for Tangier.  Here I understand\nhow the two Dukes, both the only sons of the Duke of York, are sick even\nto danger, and that on Sunday last they were both so ill, as that the poor\nDuchess was in doubt which would die first: the Duke of Cambridge of some\ngeneral disease; the other little Duke, whose title I know not, of the\nconvulsion fits, of which he had four this morning.  Fear that either of\nthem might be dead, did make us think that it was the occasion that the\nDuke of York and others were not come to the meeting of the Commission\nwhich was designed, and my Lord Chancellor did expect.  And it was pretty\nto observe how, when my Lord sent down to St. James's to see why the Duke\nof York come not, and Mr. Povy, who went, returned, my Lord (Chancellor)\ndid ask, not how the Princes or the Dukes do, as other people do, but \"How\ndo the children?\" which methought was mighty great, and like a great man\nand grandfather.  I find every body mightily concerned for these children,\nas a matter wherein the State is much concerned that they should live.  At\nlast it was found that the meeting did fail from no known occasion, at\nwhich my Lord Chancellor was angry, and did cry out against Creed that he\nshould give him no notice. So Povy and I went forth, and staid at the gate\nof the house by the streete, and there stopped to talk about the business\nof the Treasury of Tangier, which by the badness of our credit, and the\nresolution that the Governor shall not be paymaster, will force me to\nprovide one there to be my paymaster, which I will never do, but rather\nlose my place, for I will not venture my fortune to a fellow to be\nemployed so far off, and in that wicked place.  Thence home, and with Fist\npresently to the finishing the writing fair of our report.  And by and by\nto Sir W. Batten's, and there he and I and [Sir] J. Minnes and [Sir] W.\nPen did read and sign it with great good liking, and so away to the office\nagain to look over and correct it, and then home to supper and to bed, my\nmind being pretty well settled, having this report done, and so to supper\nand to bed.\n\n15th.  [This morning my wife had some things brought home by a new woman\nof the New Exchange, one Mrs. Smith, which she would have me see for her\nfine hand, and indeed it is a fine hand, and the woman I have observed is\na mighty pretty looked woman.]  Up, and with Sir W. Batten and [Sir] J.\nMinnes to St. James's, and stopt at Temple Bar for Sir J. Minnes to go\ninto the Devil's Taverne to shit, he having drunk whey, and his belly\nwrought.  Being come, we up to the Duke of York's chamber, who, when\nready, we to our usual business, and being very glad, we all that signed\nit, that is, Sir J. Minnes, W. Batten, W. Pen, and myself, and then Sir G.\nCarteret and [Sir] W. Coventry, Bruncker, and T. Harvy, and the officers\nof the Ordnance, Sir J. Duncombe, and Mr. Cholmely presented our report\nabout Carcasse, and did afterwards read it with that success that the Duke\nof York was for punishing him, not only with turning him out of the\noffice, but with what other punishment he could, which nobody did forward,\nand so he escaped, only with giving security to secure the King against\ndouble tickets of his and other things that he might have wronged the King\nor subject in before his dismission.  Yet, Lord!  to see how our silly\nLord Bruncker would have stood to have justified this rogue, though to the\nreproach of all us who have signed, which I shall never forget to have\nbeen a most malicious or a most silly act, and I do think it is as much\nthe latter as the other, for none but a fool could have done as this silly\nLord hath done in this business.  So the Duke of York did like our report,\nand ordered his being secured till he did give his security, which did\nfully content me, and will I hope vindicate the office.  It happened that\nmy Lord Arlington coming in by chance was at the hearing of all this,\nwhich I was not sorry for, for he did move or did second the Duke of York\nthat this roguery of his might be put in the News-book that it might be\nmade publique to satisfy for the wrong the credit of this office hath\nreceived by this rogue's occasion.  So with utmost content I away with Sir\nG. Carteret to London, talking all the way; and he do tell me that the\nbusiness of my Lord Hinchingbroke his marriage with my Lord Burlington's\ndaughter is concluded on by all friends; and that my Lady is now told of\nit, and do mightily please herself with it; which I am mighty glad of.  So\nhome, and there I find that my wife hath been at my desire at the Inne,\nthinking that my father might be come up with the coach, but he is not\ncome this week, poor man, but will be here the next.  At noon to dinner,\nand then to Sir W. Batten's, where I hear the news how our Embassadors\nwere but ill received at Flushing, nor at Bredah itself, there being only\na house and no furniture provided for them, though it be said that they\nhave as much as the French.  Here we staid talking a little, and then I to\nthe office about my business, and thence to the office, where busy about\nmy own papers of my office, and by and by comes the office full to examine\nSir W. Warren's account, which I do appear mighty fierce in against him,\nand indeed am, for his accounts are so perplexed that I am sure he cannot\nbut expect to get many a L1000 in it before it passes our hands, but I\nwill not favour him, but save what I can to the King.  At his accounts,\nwherein I very high against him, till late, and then we broke up with\nlittle done, and so broke up, and I to my office, where late doing of\nbusiness, and then home to supper and to bed. News still that my Lord\nTreasurer is so ill as not to be any man of this world; and it is said\nthat the Treasury shall be managed by Commission. I would to God Sir G.\nCarteret, or my Lord Sandwich, be in it!  But the latter is the more fit\nfor it.  This day going to White Hall, Sir W. Batten did tell me strange\nstories of Sir W. Pen, how he is already ashamed of the fine coach which\nhis son-in-law and daughter have made, and indeed it is one of the most\nridiculous things for people of their low, mean fashion to make such a\ncoach that ever I saw.  He tells me how his people come as they do to mine\nevery day to borrow one thing or other, and that his Lady hath been forced\nto sell some coals (in the late dear time) only to enable her to pay money\nthat she hath borrowed of Griffin to defray her family expense, which is a\nstrange story for a rogue that spends so much money on clothes and other\noccasions himself as he do, but that which is most strange, he tells me\nthat Sir W. Pen do not give L6000, as is usually [supposed], with his\ndaughter to him, and that Mr. Lowder is come to use the tubb, that is to\nbathe and sweat himself, and that his lady is come to use the tubb too,\nwhich he takes to be that he hath, and hath given her the pox, but I hope\nit is not so, but, says Sir W. Batten, this is a fair joynture, that he\nhath made her, meaning by that the costs the having of a bath.\n\n16th.  Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and, among\nother things, comes in Mr. Carcasse, and after many arguings against it,\ndid offer security as was desired, but who should this be but Mr. Powell,\nthat is one other of my Lord Bruncker's clerks; and I hope good use will\nbe made of it.  But then he began to fall foul upon the injustice of the\nBoard, which when I heard I threatened him with being laid by the heels,\nwhich my Lord Bruncker took up as a thing that I could not do upon the\noccasion he had given, but yet did own that it was ill said of him.  I\nmade not many words of it, but have let him see that I can say what I will\nwithout fear of him, and so we broke off, leaving the bond to be drawn by\nme, which I will do in the best manner I can.  At noon, this being Holy\nThursday, that is, Ascension Day, when the boys go on procession round the\nparish, we were to go to the Three Tuns' Tavern, to dine with the rest of\nthe parish; where all the parish almost was, Sir Andrew Rickard and\nothers; and of our house, J. Minnes, W. Batten, W. Pen, and myself; and\nMr. Mills did sit uppermost at the table.  Here we were informed that the\nreport of our Embassadors being ill received in their way to Bredah is not\ntrue, but that they are received with very great civility, which I am glad\nto hear.  But that that did vex me was that among all us there should come\nin Mr. Carcasse to be a guest for his money (5s. a piece) as well as any\nof us.  This did vex me, and I would have gone, and did go to my house,\nthinking to dine at home, but I was called away from them, and so we sat\ndown, and to dinner.  Among other things Sir John Fredericke and Sir R.\nFord did talk of Paul's School, which, they tell me, must be taken away;\nand then I fear it will be long before another place, as they say is\npromised, is found; but they do say that the honour of their company is\nconcerned in the doing of it, and that it is a thing that they are obliged\nto do.  Thence home, and to my office, where busy; anon at 7 at night I\nand my wife and Sir W. Pen in his coach to Unthanke's, my wife's tailor,\nfor her to speak one word, and then we to my Lord Treasurer's, where I\nfind the porter crying, and suspected it was that my Lord is dead; and,\npoor Lord! we did find that he was dead just now; and the crying of the\nfellow did so trouble me, that considering I was not likely to trouble him\nany more, nor have occasion to give any more anything, I did give him 3s.;\nbut it may be, poor man, he hath lost a considerable hope by the death of\nhis Lord, whose house will be no more frequented as before, and perhaps I\nmay never come thither again about any business.  There is a good man\ngone: and I pray God that the Treasury may not be worse managed by the\nhand or hands it shall now be put into; though, for certain, the slowness,\nthough he was of great integrity, of this man, and remissness, have gone\nas far to undo the nation, as anything else that hath happened; and yet,\nif I knew all the difficulties that he hath lain under, and his instrument\nSir Philip Warwicke, I might be brought to another mind.  Thence we to\nIslington, to the Old House, and there eat and drank, and then it being\nlate and a pleasant evening, we home, and there to my chamber, and to bed.\nIt is remarkable that this afternoon Mr. Moore come to me, and there,\namong other things, did tell me how Mr. Moyer, the merchant, having\nprocured an order from the King and Duke of York and Council, with the\nconsent of my Lord Chancellor, and by assistance of Lord Arlington, for\nthe releasing out of prison his brother, Samuel Moyer, who was a great man\nin the late times in Haberdashers'-hall, and was engaged under hand and\nseal to give the man that obtained it so much in behalf of my Lord\nChancellor; but it seems my Lady Duchess of Albemarle had before\nundertaken it for so much money, but hath not done it.  The Duke of\nAlbemarle did the next day send for this Moyer, to tell him, that\nnotwithstanding this order of the King and Council's being passed for\nrelease of his brother, yet, if he did not consider the pains of some\nfriends of his, he would stop that order.  This Moyer being an honest,\nbold man, told him that he was engaged to the hand that had done the thing\nto give him a reward; and more he would not give, nor could own any\nkindness done by his Grace's interest; and so parted.  The next day Sir\nEdward Savage did take the said Moyer in tax about it, giving ill words of\nthis Moyer and his brother; which he not being able to bear, told him he\nwould give to the person that had engaged him what he promised, and not\nany thing to any body else; and that both he and his brother were as\nhonest men as himself, or any man else; and so sent him going, and bid him\ndo his worst.  It is one of the most extraordinary cases that ever I saw\nor understood; but it is true.  This day Mr. Sheply is come to town and to\nsee me, and he tells me my father is very well only for his pain, so that\nhe is not able to stir; but is in great pain.  I would to God that he were\nin town that I might have what help can be got for him, for it troubles me\nto have him live in that condition of misery if I can help it.\n\n17th.  Up, and to the office, where all the morning upon some accounts of\nMr. Gawden's, and at noon to the Three Tuns to dinner with Lord Bruncker,\nSir J. Minnes, W. Batten, W. Pen, and T. Harvy, where very merry, and my\nLord Bruncker in appearance as good friends as ever, though I know he has\na hatred to me in heart.  After dinner to my house, where Mr. Sheply\ndined, and we drank and talked together.  He, poor man, hath had his arm\nbroke the late frost, slipping in going over Huntingdon Bridge.  He tells\nme that jasper Trice and Lewes Phillips and Mr. Ashfield are gone from\nBrampton, and he thinks chiefly from the height of Sir J. Bernard's\ncarriage, who carries all things before him there, which they cannot bear\nwith, and so leave the town, and this is a great instance of the advantage\na man of the law hath over all other people, which would make a man to\nstudy it a little.  Sheply being gone, there come the flageolet master,\nwho having had a bad bargain of teaching my wife by the year, she not\npractising so much as she should do, I did think that the man did deserve\nsome more consideration, and so will give him an opportunity of 20s. a\nmonth more, and he shall teach me, and this afternoon I begun, and I think\nit will be a few shillings well spent.  Then to Sir R. Viner's with 600\npieces of gold to turn into silver, for the enabling me to answer Sir G.\nCarteret's L3000; which he now draws all out of my hand towards the paying\nfor a purchase he hath made for his son and my Lady Jemimah, in\nNorthamptonshire, of Sir Samuel Luke, in a good place; a good house, and\nnear all her friends; which is a very happy thing.  Thence to St. James's,\nand there spoke with Sir W. Coventry, and give him some account of some\nthings, but had little discourse with him, there being company with him,\nand so directly home again and then to my office, doing some business, and\nso to my house, and with my wife to practice on the flageolet a little,\nand with great pleasure I see she can readily hit her notes, but only want\nof practice makes her she cannot go through a whole tune readily.  So to\nsupper and to bed.\n\n18th.  Up, and all the morning at the office, and then to dinner, and\nafter dinner to the office to dictate some letters, and then with my wife\nto Sir W. Turner's to visit The., but she being abroad we back again home,\nand then I to the office, finished my letters, and then to walk an hour in\nthe garden talking with my wife, whose growth in musique do begin to\nplease me mightily, and by and by home and there find our Luce drunk, and\nwhen her mistress told her of it would be gone, and so put up some of her\nthings and did go away of her accord, nobody pressing her to it, and the\ntruth is, though she be the dirtiest, homeliest servant that ever I kept,\nyet I was sorry to have her go, partly through my love to my servants, and\npartly because she was a very drudging, working wench, only she would be\ndrunk.  But that which did a little trouble me was that I did hear her\ntell her mistress that she would tell her master something before she was\naware of her that she would be sorry to have him know; but did it in such\na silly, drunken manner, that though it trouble me a little, yet not\nknowing what to suspect she should know, and not knowing well whether she\nsaid it to her mistress or Jane, I did not much think of it.  So she gone,\nwe to supper and to bed, my study being made finely clean.\n\n19th (Lord's day).  Up, and to my chamber to set some papers in order, and\nthen, to church, where my old acquaintance, that dull fellow, Meriton,\nmade a good sermon, and hath a strange knack of a grave, serious delivery,\nwhich is very agreeable.  After church to White Hall, and there find Sir\nG. Carteret just set down to dinner, and I dined with them, as I intended,\nand good company, the best people and family in the world I think.  Here\nwas great talk of the good end that my Lord Treasurer made; closing his\nowne eyes and setting his mouth, and bidding adieu with the greatest\ncontent and freedom in the world; and is said to die with the cleanest\nhands that ever any Lord Treasurer did.  After dinner Sir G. Carteret and\nI alone, and there, among other discourse, he did declare that he would be\ncontent to part with his place of Treasurer of the Navy upon good terms.\nI did propose my Lord Belasses as a man likely to buy it, which he\nlistened to, and I did fully concur and promote his design of parting with\nit, for though I would have my father live, I would not have him die\nTreasurer of the Navy, because of the accounts which must be uncleared at\nhis death, besides many other circumstances making it advisable for him to\nlet it go.  He tells me that he fears all will come to naught in the\nnation soon if the King do not mind his business, which he do not seem\nlikely to do.  He says that the Treasury will be managed for a while by a\nCommission, whereof he thinks my Lord Chancellor for the honour of it, and\nmy Lord Ashly, and the two Secretaries will be, and some others he knows\nnot.  I took leave of him, and directly by water home, and there to read\nthe life of Mr. Hooker, which pleases me as much as any thing I have read\na great while, and by and by comes Mr. Howe to see us, and after him a\nlittle Mr. Sheply, and so we all to talk, and, Mercer being there, we some\nof us to sing, and so to supper, a great deal of silly talk.  Among other\nthings, W. Howe told us how the Barristers and Students of Gray's Inne\nrose in rebellion against the Benchers the other day, who outlawed them,\nand a great deal of do; but now they are at peace again.  They being gone,\nI to my book again, and made an end of Mr. Hooker's Life, and so to bed.\n\n20th.  Up betimes, and comes my flagelette master to set me a new tune,\nwhich I played presently, and shall in a month do as much as I desire at\nit.  He being gone, I to several businesses in my chamber, and then by\ncoach to the Commissioners of Excise, and so to Westminster Hall, and\nthere spoke with several persons I had to do with.  Here among other news,\nI hear that the Commissioners for the Treasury were named by the King\nyesterday; but who they are nobody could tell: but the persons are the\nLord Chancellor, the two Secretaries, Lord Ashly, and others say Sir W."}

{"ID": 482, "text": "We turn northward,\nfollowing the stream; the road becomes distressingly steep, recalling\na line in which the poet speaks of returning homeward \"to his mountain\nstronghold.\" (Sat. II, vi, 16.) Soon we reach a village, Roccagiovine,\nwhose central square is named Piazza Vacuna. Vacuna was the ancient name\nfor the goddess Victory; and against the wall is fixed an exhumed tablet\ntelling how the Emperor Vespasian here restored an ancient Temple of\nVictory. One more echo this name wakes in Horatian ears--he dates a\nletter to his friend Aristius Fuscus as written \"behind the crumbling\nshrine of Vacuna.\" (Ep. I, x, 49.) Clearly we are near him now; he\nwould not carry his writing tablets far away from his door. Yet another\nverification we require. He speaks of a spring just beside his home, cool\nand fine, medicinal to head and stomach. (Ep. I, xvi, 12.) Here it is,\nhard by, called to-day Fonte d'Oratini, a survival, we should like to\nbelieve, of the name Horatius. Somewhere close at hand must have been\nthe villa, on one side or the other of a small hill now called Monte\nRotondo. We may take our Horace from our pocket, and feel, as with our\nWordsworth at Dove Cottage, with our Scott at Ashestiel, that we are\ngazing on the hills, the streams, and valleys, which received the primal\noutpourings of their muse, and are for ever vocal with its memories.\n\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF HORACE'S VILLA.]\n\nFrom M. Rotondo, eastward to the Licenza, and southward to the\nhigh ground of Roccogiovine, stretched apparently the poet's not\ninconsiderable demesne. Part of it he let off to five peasants on the\n_m\u00e9tayage_ system; the rest he cultivated himself, employing eight\nslaves superintended by a bailiff. The house, he tells us, was simple,\nwith no marble pillars or gilded cornices (Od. II, xviii), but spacious\nenough to receive and entertain a guest from town, and to welcome\noccasionally his neighbours to a cheerful evening meal--\"nights and\nsuppers as of gods\" (Sat. II, vi, 65), he calls them; where the talk\nwas unfashionably clean and sensible, the fare beans and bacon, garden\nstuff and chicory and mallows."}
{"ID": 915, "text": " 7,000 people were killed\n        in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory\n        to the God of Heaven.\n011:014 The second Woe is past; the third Woe will soon be here.\n011:015 The seventh angel blew his trumpet; and there followed loud\n        voices in Heaven which said, \"The sovereignty of the world\n        now belongs to our Lord and His Christ; and He will be King\n        until the Ages of the Ages.\"\n011:016 Then the twenty-four Elders, who sit on thrones in the presence\n        of God, fell on their faces and worshipped God,\n011:017 saying, \"We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Ruler of all,\n        Who art and wast, because Thou hast exerted Thy power,\n        Thy great power, and hast become King.\n011:018 The nations grew angry, and Thine anger has come, and the time\n        for the dead to be judged, and the time for Thee to give\n        their reward to Thy servants the Prophets and to Thy people,\n        and to those who fear Thee, the small and the great,\n        and to destroy those who destroy the earth.\"\n011:019 Then the doors of God's sanctuary in Heaven were opened,\n        and the Ark, in which His Covenant was, was seen in His sanctuary;\n        and there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals\n        of thunder, and an earthquake, and heavy hail.\n012:001 And a great marvel was seen in Heaven--a woman who was robed\n        with the sun and had the moon under her feet, and had also\n        a wreath of stars round her head, was with child,\n012:002 and she was crying out in the pains and agony of childbirth.\n012:003 And another marvel was seen in Heaven--a great fiery-red Dragon,\n        with seven heads and ten horns; and on his heads were\n        seven kingly crowns.\n012:004 His tail was drawing after it a third part of the stars of Heaven,\n        and it dashed them to the ground.  And in front of the woman\n        who was about to become a mother, the Dragon was standing\n        in order to devour the child as soon as it was born.\n012:005 She gave birth to a son--a male child, destined before long\n        to rule all nations with an iron scepter.  But her child\n        was caught up to God and His throne,\n012:006 and the woman fled into the Desert, there to be cared for,\n        for 1,260 days, in a place which God had prepared for her.\n012:007 And war broke out in Heaven, Michael and his angels engaging\n        in battle with the Dragon.\n012:008 The Dragon fought and so did his angels; but they were defeated,\n        and there was no longer any room found for them in Heaven.\n012:009 The great Dragon, the ancient serpent, he who is called `the Devil'\n        and `the Adversary' and leads the whole earth astray,\n        was hurled down:  he was hurled down to the earth, and his\n        angels were hurled down with him.\n012:010 Then I heard a loud voice speaking in Heaven.\n        It said, \"The salvation and the power and the Kingdom\n        of our God have now come, and the sovereignty of His Christ;\n        for the accuser of our brethren has been hurled down--he who,\n        day after day and night after night, was wont to accuse them\n        in the presence of God.\n012:011 But they have gained the victory over him because of the blood\n        of the Lamb and of the testimony which they have borne,\n        and because they held their lives cheap and did not shrink\n        even from death.\n012:012 For this reason be glad, O Heaven, and you who live\n        in Heaven!  Alas for the earth and the sea!  For the Devil\n        has come down to you; full of fierce anger, because he knows\n        that his appointed time is short.\"\n012:013 And when the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth,\n        he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to\n        the male child.\n012:014 Then, the two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman\n        to enable her to fly away into the Desert to the place\n        assigned her, there to be cared for, for a period of time,\n        two periods of time, and half a period of time, beyond the reach\n        of the serpent.\n012:015 And the serpent poured water from his mouth--a very river it seemed--\n        after the woman, in the hope that she would be carried away\n        by its flood.\n012:016 But the earth came to the woman's help:  it opened its\n        mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured\n        from his mouth.\n012:017 This made the Dragon furiously angry with the woman, and he went\n        elsewhere to make war upon her other children--those who keep\n        God's commandments and hold fast to the testimony of Jesus.\n013:001 And he took up a position upon the sands of the sea-shore. Then I\n        saw a Wild Beast coming up out of the sea, and he had ten\n        horns and seven heads.  On his horns were ten kingly crowns,\n        and inscribed on his heads were names full of blasphemy.\n013:002 The Wild Beast which I saw resembled a leopard, and had feet\n        like the feet of a bear, and his mouth was like the mouth\n        of a lion; and it was to the Dragon that he owed his power\n        and his throne and his wide dominion.\n013:003 I saw that one of his heads seemed to have been mortally wounded;\n        but his mortal wound was healed, and the whole world was amazed\n        and followed him.\n013:004 And they offered worship to the Dragon, because it was to him\n        that the Wild Beast owed his dominion; and they also offered\n        worship to the Wild Beast, and said, \"Who is there like him?\n        And who is able to engage in battle with him?\"\n013:005 And there was given him a mouth full of boastful and\n        blasphemous words; and liberty of action was granted him\n        for forty-two months.\n013:006 And he opened his mouth to utter blasphemies against God,\n        to speak evil of His name and of His dwelling-place--\n        that is to say, of those who dwell in Heaven.\n013:007 And permission was given him to make war upon God's people\n        and conquer them; and power was given him over every tribe,\n        people, language and nation.\n013:008 And all the inhabitants of the earth will be found to be\n        worshipping him:  every one whose name is not recorded in\n        the Book of Life--the Book of the Lamb who has been offered\n        in sacrifice ever since the creation of the world.\n013:009 Let all who have ears give heed.\n013:010 If any one is eager to lead others into captivity, he must\n        himself go into captivity.  If any one is bent on killing\n        with the sword, he must himself be killed by the sword.\n        Here is an opportunity for endurance, and for the exercise\n        of faith, on the part of God's people.\n013:011 Then I saw another Wild Beast, coming up out of the earth.\n        He had two horns like those of a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon.\n013:012 And the authority of the first Wild Beast--the whole of\n        that authority--he exercises in his presence, and he causes\n        the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first Wild Beast,\n        whose mortal wound had been healed.\n013:013 He also works great miracles, so as even to make fire come\n        down from Heaven to earth in the presence of human beings.\n013:014 And his power of leading astray the inhabitants of the earth\n        is due to the marvels which he has been permitted to work\n        in the presence of the Wild Beast.  And he told the inhabitants\n        of the earth to erect a statue to the Wild Beast who had\n        received the sword-stroke and yet had recovered.\n013:015 And power was granted him to give breath to the statue\n        of the Wild Beast, so that the statue of the Wild Beast\n        could even speak and cause all who refuse to worship it\n        to be put to death.\n013:016 And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free men\n        and slaves, to have stamped upon them a mark on their right\n        hands or on their foreheads,\n013:017 in order that no one should be allowed to buy or sell unless\n        he had the mark--either the name of the Wild Beast or the number\n        which his name represents.\n013:018 Here is scope for ingenuity.  Let people of shrewd intelligence\n        calculate the number of the Wild Beast; for it indicates\n        a certain man, and his number is 666.\n014:001 Then I looked, and I saw the Lamb standing upon Mount Zion,\n        and with Him 144,000 people, having His name and His Father's\n        name written on their foreheads.\n014:002 And I heard music from Heaven which resembled the sound of many\n        waters and the roar of loud thunder; and the music which I\n        heard was like that of harpists playing upon their harps.\n014:003 And they were singing what seemed to be a new song, in front\n        of the throne and in the presence of the four living creatures\n        and the Elders; and no one was able to learn that song except\n        the 144,000 people who had been redeemed out of the world.\n014:004 These are those who had not defiled themselves with women:\n        they are as pure as virgins.  They follow the Lamb wherever He goes.\n        They have been redeemed from among men, as firstfruits to God\n        and to the Lamb.\n014:005 And no lie has ever been found upon their lips:\n        they are faultless.\n014:006 And I saw another angel flying across the sky, carrying the Good News\n        of the Ages to tell to every nation, tribe, language and people,\n        among those who live on the earth.\n014:007 He said in a loud voice, \"Fear God and give Him glory,\n        because the time of His judgment has come; and worship Him\n        who made sky and earth, the sea and the water-springs.\"\n014:008 And another, a second angel, followed, exclaiming, \"Great Babylon\n        has fallen, has fallen--she who made all the nations drink\n        the wine of the anger provoked by her fornication.\"\n014:009 And another, a third angel, followed them, exclaiming in a\n        loud voice, \"If any one worships the Wild Beast and his statue,\n        and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,\n014:010 he shall drink the wine of God's anger which stands ready,\n        undiluted, in the cup of His fury, and he shall be tormented\n        with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels\n        and of the Lamb.\n014:011 And the smoke of their torment goes up until the Ages of the Ages;\n        and the worshipers of the Wild Beast and his statue have no\n        rest day or night, nor has any one who receives the mark\n        of his name.\n014:012 Here is an opportunity for endurance on the part of God's people,\n        who carefully keep His commandments and the faith of Jesus!\"\n014:013 And I heard a voice speaking from Heaven.  It said,\n        \"Write as follows:  \"`Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord\n        from this time onward.  Yes, says the Spirit, let them\n        rest from their sorrowful labours; for what they have done\n        goes with them.'\"\n014:014 Then I looked, and a white cloud appeared, and sitting on\n        the cloud was some One resembling the Son of Man, having a\n        wreath of gold upon His head and in His hand a sharp sickle.\n014:015 And another, an angel, came out of the sanctuary, calling in a loud\n        voice to Him who sat on the cloud, and saying, \"Use your sickle\n        and reap the harvest, for the hour for reaping it has come:\n        the harvest of the earth is over-ripe.\"\n014:016 Then He who sat on the cloud flung His sickle on the earth,\n        and the earth had its harvest reaped.\n014:017 And another angel came out from the sanctuary in Heaven,\n        and he too carried a sharp sickle.\n014:018 And another angel came out from the altar--he who had power\n        over fire--and he spoke in a loud voice to him who had\n        the sharp sickle, saying, \"Use your sharp sickle, and gather\n        the bunches from the vine of the earth, for its grapes are\n        now quite ripe.\"\n014:019 And the angel flung his sickle down to the earth, and reaped\n        the vine of the earth and threw the grapes into the great\n        winepress of God's anger.\n014:020 And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and out of it\n        came blood reaching the horses' bridles for a distance\n        of 200 miles.\n015:001 Then I saw another marvel in Heaven, great and wonderful--\n        there were seven angels bringing seven plagues.\n        These are the last plagues, because in them God's anger has\n        found full expression.\n015:002 And I saw what seemed to be a sea of glass mingled with fire,\n        and those who had gained the victory over the Wild Beast\n        and over his statue and the number of his name, standing by\n        the sea of glass and having harps which belonged to God.\n015:003 And they were singing the song of Moses, God's servant,\n        and the song of the Lamb.  Their words were, \"Great and\n        wonderful are Thy works, O Lord God, the Ruler of all.\n        Righteous and true are Thy ways, O King of the nations.\n015:004 Who shall not be afraid, O Lord, and glorify Thy name?\n        For Thou alone art holy.  All nations shall come and shall\n        worship Thee, because the righteousness of all that Thou hast\n        done has been made manifest.\"\n015:005 After this, when the doors of the sanctuary of the tent\n        of witness in Heaven were opened, I looked;\n015:006 and there came out of the sanctuary the seven angels who were\n        bringing the seven plagues.  The angels were clad in pure,\n        bright linen, and had girdles of gold across their breasts.\n015:007 And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels\n        seven bowls of gold, full of the anger of God who lives until\n        the Ages of the Ages.\n015:008 And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God\n        and from His power; and no one could enter the sanctuary till\n        the seven plagues brought by the seven angels were at an end.\n016:001 Then I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary say to the\n        seven angels, \"Go and pour on to the earth the seven bowls\n        of the anger of God.\"\n016:002 So the first angel went away and poured his bowl on to the earth;\n        and it brought a bad and painful sore upon the men who had on\n        them the mark of the Wild Beast and worshipped his statue.\n016:003 The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it\n        became blood, like a dead man's blood, and every living\n        creature in the sea died.\n016:004 The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs\n        of water, and they became blood.\n016:005 And I heard the angel of the waters say, \"Righteous art Thou,\n        who art and wast, the holy One, because Thou hast\n        thus taken vengeance.\n016:006 For they poured out the blood of Thy people and of the Prophets,\n        and in return Thou hast given them blood to drink.\n        And this they deserved.\"\n016:007 And I heard a voice from the altar say, \"Even so, O Lord God,\n        the Ruler of all, true and righteous are Thy judgments.\"\n016:008 Then the fourth angel poured his bowl on to the sun, and power\n        was given to it to scorch men with fire.\n016:009 And the men were severely burned; and yet they spoke evil\n        of God who had power over the plagues, and they did not repent\n        so as to give Him glory.\n016:010 The fifth angel poured his bowl on to the throne of the Wild Beast;\n        and his kingdom became darkened.

For example, if\ntwenty men exist in the universe (for simplicity's sake, I will\nsuppose them existing simultaneously, and to have had no\npredecessors), and we want to account for the existence of these\ntwenty men, it will not be enough to show the cause of human\nexistence in general; we must also show why there are exactly\ntwenty men, neither more nor less:  for a cause must be assigned\nfor the existence of each individual.

{"ID": 103, "text": "The next day, May 24th, the Major General and the runaway slave finally came face to face when they were brought to General Butler for questioning. The slaves were field hands owned by a Rebel officer who planned on taking them to Carolina to use for military operations. Two of the slaves had wives and children in Hampton. Due to the absence of precedents or instructions, the concept of contraband goods from international law was applied, which allowed for the seizure and confiscation of goods that were immediately useful for military purposes, even if they were owned as property. The slaves were regarded as contraband and put to work to construct a new bakehouse within the fort. The term \"contraband\" soon became adopted by Congress in the Act of July 6th, which confiscates slaves used in aiding the insurrection. The soldiers were told that if the slaves were not sent back to their owners, more would come to seek refuge as word spread among the slave population.On May 24th, the Second New York Regiment pitched their camp on the Segar farm, which was close to the bridge connecting the fort to the mainland. This made communication easier between the open country and the fort. On May 26th, eight African Americans came to the General Butler's quarters, seeking an audience. They were questioned by Hon. Mr. Ashley, a visitor at the fort. On May 27th, a group of 47 African Americans, ranging in age from three months to 85 years old, arrived at the fort. They were assigned to buildings outside of the fort or tents within, and were put to work as servants to officers, or to help store provisions landed from vessels. On the same day, more African Americans arrived, and they continued to come in groups of 20, 30, or 40. Some were employed as servants to officers at Newport News, where they had occupied. A request was made to the government for a policy in dealing with the disrupted and disorganized slave society. Military officers had previously acted irregularly, and in some cases, in a violation of personal rights. An authorized system was needed. On May 27th, General Butler formally reported his interview with Major Cary to the War Department, indicating how the African Americans had been used and suggesting pertinent military, political, and humane considerations. The Secretary of War replied, cautiously approving General Butler's actions and highlighting distinctions between interfering with the relations of persons held to service and refusing to surrender them to their alleged masters. On July 6th, an Act of Congress was passed that declared any person claiming the labor of another and permitting them to be employed in military or naval service against the US government shall forfeit their claim to such labor. This act was intended for direction of the civil magistrate, not for the limitation of military law powers.Major General Fremont recently proclaimed that the slaves of all persons within his department, who were in arms against the government, were to be considered freemen. He even provided title deeds of manumission. However, President Lincoln subsequently limited this proclamation to such slaves as are included in the Act of Congress, namely, the slaves of Rebels used in directly hostile service. The revocation of this proclamation was seen by some as a deference to protests from Kentucky. Even though the loyal citizens of Missouri seemed to approve the measure, they were overruled by the more influential voice of other communities. However, the commanding officer had the power to make the order within his department, and therefore, all human beings included in the proclamation acquired a vested title to their freedom. No conclusive laws necessitated the limitation, so it cannot rest on any safe reasons of military policy. The government should look every issue, however grave, firmly in the face and proceed with inexorable purpose to inflict blows where the rebellion is the weakest. The war department received inquiries, inspired by good sense and humanity, from General Butler concerning the nine hundred contrabands that they had. Assuming the slaves have been the property of masters, he considers them waifs that have reverted to the normal condition of those made in God's image. It is proper to add that the answer of the War Department leaves the General uninstructed as to all slaves not confiscated by the Act of Congress. The personal narrative of affairs at Fortress Monroe is resumed. The encampment of Federal troops beyond the peninsula of the fort and in the vicinity of the village of Hampton resulted in the white inhabitants fleeing and burning as much of the bridge as they could. A detachment of troops entered the village on the 28th of May and hoisted the stars and stripes on the house of Colonel Mallory. Finally, a permanent encampment was made there on July 1st, and the troops remained until July 16th.After crossing the newly rebuilt bridge, exchanging our rifle muskets and bidding farewell to General Butler and Colonel Dimick, my time spent in Hampton allowed me to gain valuable knowledge about the local African American population. Hampton itself has a rich history, with Captain John Smith and his crew visiting the site in 1607, where they met with an Indian tribe and named the neighboring promontory Point Comfort. It was attacked twice by hostile fleets, and Jackson famously referenced its importance in his address to troops before the Battle of New Orleans. Prior to its recent destruction, the town boasted ancient relics like St. John's Church, which had survived even foreign invasions. However, the majority of the buildings were old and lacked upkeep, with the town surviving on its oyster sales. The recent conflagration, deemed unnecessary even for military purposes, was the result of Confederate leaders attempting to prove their heroism. The exodus of nearly all the town's inhabitants demonstrated their political stance, with only two votes cast against Secession."}

He did not appear to hold even any\nresentment.\n\nNor did he. Kilmeny had been brought too near the grim realities to hold\nany petty pique. He found this young woman still charming, but his\nadmiration was tinctured with amusement. No longer did his imagination\nplay upon her personality. He focused it upon the girl who had fought\nfor his life against the ridicule and the suspicions of her friends. It\nwas impossible for him to escape the allure of her fine sweet courage\nso gallantly expressed in every look and motion.\n\nBut Moya let him severely alone. Her pride was suffering because she had\nshowed to all her little world too keen an interest in him. In her\nanxiety to repudiate any claim he might think she felt she had upon him\nthe girl was scornfully indifferent to his advances. Almost rudely she\nrejected his gratitude.\n\n\"The man does not owe me anything. Can't he see that honors are easy?\"\nshe said impatiently to Lady Farquhar.\n\nJack Kilmeny was no quitter. He set that lean jaw of his and would not\naccept repulse. In four days now the Farquhar party was going to leave\nGoldbanks and he made the most of his time.\n\nMoya never saw him coming toward her without having her pulses stirred,\nbut her look met his always quietly and steadily. Not once did she give\nhim a chance to see her alone. Even Lady Farquhar, who had been a severe\ncritic of her vagaries, commended now her discretion. Jack rebelled\nagainst it in vain. He could not find a chance to speak. It was\ncharacteristic of him that he made one.\n\nBy shrewd maneuvering he arranged an expedition to the Silent Sam mine.\nThe property itself was of no particular interest. The attractive\nfeature was a descent in ore buckets from the shaft-house, perched far\nup on the edge of a precipitous cliff, to the mill in the valley below.\nThis was made by means of heavy cables to which the buckets were\nsuspended. After Jack had explained how the men rode back and forth by\nthis means between the mill and the mine India was seized with the\ninspiration he had hoped for.\n\n\"Let's go down in the buckets, dear people.\"\n\nLady Farquhar protested and was overruled by a chorus of votes. The\nminer assured her that it was entirely safe. Reluctantly she gave\npermission for her flock to make the trip if they desired.\n\nThey rode on horseback to the mill. Jack paired with India, making no\nattempt to ride beside Moya, who brought up the rear with the captain.\nThe Westerner, answering the questions of his cousin, was at his\ndebonair best. Occasionally there drifted back to the couple in the rear\nfragmentary snatches of his talk. He was telling of the time he had been\na mule skinner in New Mexico, of how he had ridden mail near Deming, and\nof frontier days at Tombstone. Casual anecdotes were sprinkled through\nhis explanations to liven them. He spoke in the slurring drawl of the\nSouthwest, which went so well with the brown lean face beneath the\npinched-in felt hat and the well-packed vigor of the man.\n\n\"And what is 'bucking a sample'?\" India wanted to know after one of his\nstories.\n\n\"You just pound some rock up and mix it to get a sample. Once when I was\ndrag-driver of a herd in a round-up....\"\n\nMoya heard no more. She turned her attention resolutely to her companion\nand tried to detach her mind from the man in front. She might as well\nhave tried to keep her heart from beating.\n\nAfter they had arrived at the mill Jack quietly took charge of the\ndisposition of the party. Verinder and Joyce were sent up in the first\nbucket. When this was halfway up to the mine the cable stopped to let\nanother couple enter a bucket. Joyce, fifty feet up in the air, waved\nher hand to those below.\n\n\"You next, India,\" ordered her cousin.\n\nThe young woman stepped into the bucket. \"I'm 'fraid,\" she announced\npromptly.\n\n\"No need to be. Captain, your turn.\"\n\nThe eyes of the two men met. Ned Kilmeny guessed instantly that the\nother had arranged this so as to get a few minutes alone with Moya. He\ntook a place beside his sister immediately.\n\nThe cable did not stop again until the second pair of passengers had\nreached the mine.\n\nMoya, followed by Jack, stepped into the basket, which began to rise\nsteadily as it moved across the valley.\n\nKilmeny did not lose a minute.\n\n\"Why don't you let me see you alone? Why do you run away from me?\" he\ndemanded.\n\nLittle patches of color burned beneath the shadows of her eyes. A sound\nas of a distant surf began to beat in her ears.\n\n\"What nonsense! Why should I run from you?\" she asked, meeting with\ndifficulty the attack of his masterful gaze.\n\n\"Because you're afraid to let me tell you that I love you,\" he charged.\n\n\"Thought it was Joyce you ... fancied,\" she retorted quietly, her pulse\nhammering.\n\n\"So it was. I fancied her. I love you. I'm asking you to marry me.\"\n\n\"You don't have to ask me to marry you because you exaggerate the\nservice I did you.\"\n\n\"I ask you because I love you.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much for the compliment. Sorry I must decline.\" She did\nnot dare look at him. Her eyes were fixed on the mill far below.\n\n\"Why must you--since you love me?\"\n\nThe telltale pink stained her cheeks. \"You take that for granted, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"It's true, I believe. How can I make love to you as other men do? Lady\nFarquhar won't let me see you alone--even if you were willing to give me\na chance. In two days you are going out of my life. I must speak the\ntruth ... bluntly. I love you. It has been that way with me ever since\nyou came into my life again, little Moya. But I was blind and didn't see\nit till ... till I was alone in the mine with death.\"\n\n\"I ... am sorry.\"\n\n\"That is not enough. I'm going to have the truth. You saved my life.\nWhat for? It is yours ... if you will take it.\"\n\nShe looked straight at him. \"I can't marry you.\"\n\n\"Why can't you? Can you say that you don't love me?\"\n\nIn the full-charged silence that followed a stifling emotion raced\nthrough her blood. The excitement in her set a pulse beating in her\nthroat. Womanlike, she evaded the issue.\n\n\"The cable has stopped. What has happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing has happened. It has stopped because I arranged with the\nengineer at the hoist to have it stop. When I give the signal it will\nstart again.\"\n\n\"But....\"\n\nHe brushed aside her futile protest. \"I'm going to have this out with\nyou. Dare you tell me that you don't love me, Moya?\"\n\nHe forced her to meet his eyes, and in that moment she felt weak and\nfaint. The throb of passion beat tumultuously against her will.\n\n\"Please ... be generous. What will they think? Let us start,\" she\nbegged.\n\n\"They will think something is wrong with the machinery. But it doesn't\nmatter in the least what they think. It's my last chance, and I'll not\ngive it up. You've got to answer me.\"\n\nThe point where the bucket had stopped was a hundred feet above the\nground below. She looked down, and shuddered.\n\n\"It's so far down ... please.\"\n\n\"Then don't look down. Look at me, Moya. It won't take you a moment to\nanswer me.\"\n\n\"I have. I said I couldn't marry you.\"\n\n\"Tell me that you don't love me and I'll give the signal.\"\n\n\"I ... don't.\"\n\n\"Look straight at me and say it.\"\n\nShe tried to look at him and repeat it, but her eyes betrayed the secret\nshe was fighting to keep from him. The long lashes fell to the hot\ncheeks an instant too late.\n\nHis hand found hers. \"My little Irish wild rose, all sweetness and\nthorns,\" he murmured.\n\nAbove the tumult of her heart she heard her voice say, as if it were\nthat of a stranger, \"It's no use ...

Isn't that a good\ndeal?\"\n\nThe desire of her, pure as a flame, swept through him. \"It's the\ngreatest thing that ever came into my life. Do you think I'm going to\nlet it end there? I'm going to fight for our happiness. I'm going to\nbeat down the things that come between us.\"\n\n\"You can't. It's too late,\" she cried wistfully.\n\n\"It's never too late for love so long as we're both alive.\"\n\n\"Not for love, but....\"\n\n\"You've got to see this as I see it, sweetheart. I'm a man--primitive,\nif you like. I've done wild and evil things--plenty of them. What of\nthat? I slough them off and trample them down. The heart of me is clean,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTo look at him was enough to clear away all doubt. He had the faults\nthat go with full-blooded elemental life, but at bottom this virile\nAmerican was sound.\n\n\"Well! Isn't that enough?\"\n\nThe little movement of her hands toward him seemed to beg for pity.\n\"Jack! I can't help it. Maybe I'm a little prig, but ... mustn't we\nguide our lives by principle and not by impulse?\"\n\n\"Do I guide mine by impulse?\"\n\n\"Don't you?\" She hurried on to contradict, or at least to modify, her\nreluctant charge. \"Oh, I know you are a great influence here. You're\nknown all over the state. Men follow you wherever you lead. Why should I\ncriticize you--I, who have done nothing all my life but lean on others?\"\n\n\"Go ahead. When I ask you to marry me I invite your criticism.\"\n\n\"I have to take little steps and to keep in well-worn paths. I can't\nmake laws for myself as you do. Those that have been made may be wrong,\nbut I must obey them.\"\n\n\"Why? Why should you? If they're wrong, fight against them.\"\n\n\"I can't argue with you ... dear. But I know what I think right. I\n_want_ to think as you do. Oh, you don't know how I long to throw my\nPuritan conscience overboard and just trust your judgment. I ... admire\nyou tremendously. But I can't give in ... I can't.\"\n\nThe muscles stood out on his lean cheeks as he set his teeth. \"You've\ngot to, Moya. Our love has been foreordained. Do you think it is for\nnothing that we met again after all these years? You're mine--the one\nwoman in the world I want and am going to have.\"\n\nShe shook her head sadly. \"No ... no!\"\n\n\"Is it the money I have made highgrading? Is that what stands between\nus? If I were able to come to you without a dollar but with clean\nhands--would you marry me then?\"\n\nHe leaned toward her, eager, ardent, passionate, the color in his cheeks\nburning to a dull brick tint beneath the tan. Body and soul she swayed\ntoward him. All her vital love of life, of things beautiful and good and\ntrue, fused in a crescendo of emotion.\n\n\"My dear ... my dear, I'm only a girl--and I love you.\" Somehow her\nhands were buried in the strong grip of his. \"But ... I can't live on\nthe profits of what I think is wrong. If it weren't for that ... Jack,\nI'd marry you if you were a pauper--and thank God for the chance.\"\n\nHe faced her doggedly. \"I'm not a pauper. I've fought for my share of\nthe spoils. You've been brought up in a hot-house. Out in the world a\nman wins because he's strong. Do you think it's all been play with me?\nBy God, no! I've ridden night herd in a blizzard when the temperature\nwas below zero. I've done my shift on the twelfth level of the Never\nQuit many a month. I've mushed in Alaska and fought against Castro in\nVenezuela. Do you think I'm going to give up my stake now I've won it at\nlast?\"\n\nShe looked at him tremulously. \"I don't ask you to give it up. You'll\nhave to decide that for yourself.\"\n\n\"Don't you see I _can't_ give it up? If I do, I lose you. How can I take\ncare of you without money?\"\n\n\"I'd do my best, Jack.\"\n\n\"You don't understand. It would be for years--until I had made another\nstart. I wouldn't let you give up everything unless I had something to\noffer. I wouldn't consider it.\"\n\n\"Isn't that putting pride before love, Jack? You know I have a little\nmoney of my own. We could live--in very decent poverty. I would love to\nfeel that we were fighting ... together. We both know you'll win in the\nend. Wouldn't it be fine to work out your success in partnership? Dear,\nI'd _rather_ marry you while you're still a poor man.\"\n\nFor a moment the vision of it tempted him, but he put the dream away.\n\"No. It won't do. Of course I'm going to win out in the end, but it\nmight take a dozen years to set me on Easy street. For a woman brought\nup as you have been poverty is hell.\"\n\n\"Then you think I'm only a doll,\" she flashed. \"You want to put me back\nin that hot-house you mentioned. I'm just an ornament to dress up and\nlook at and play with.\"\n\n\"I think you're a little tinder-box,\" he said, smiling ruefully.\n\n\"Don't you see how it is with me, Jack? I've always craved life. I've\nwanted to take hold of it with both hands and without gloves. But they\nwould never let me. I've got my chance now ... if you really love me\nmore than you do your pride and your money. I want to live close to the\npeople--as you do.\"\n\n\"What did that suit cost you?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Don't remember. Twenty-five pounds, maybe. Why?\"\n\n\"One hundred twenty dollars, say. And you need dozens of dresses in a\nseason. I'll make a guess that it takes five thousand a year to clothe\nyou. That is nearly twice as much as I'll earn altogether next year if I\nthrow away my stake.\"\n\nShe waved his argument aside. \"Stupid boy! I have dresses enough to last\nme for five years--if you'll let me be that poor man's wife. I can make\nthem over myself later and still be the best dressed woman in camp.\"\n\nFrom above came Captain Kilmeny's shout. \"We telephoned down. The\nengineer has the trouble arranged.\"\n\nThe cable began to move.\n\n\"When shall I see you alone again, Moya?\" Jack demanded.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I'm going to see you. We've got to fight this out. I'll not let Lady\nFarquhar keep me from seeing you alone. It's serious business.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she admitted. \"I'll tell Lady Jim. But ... there's no use in\nletting you think I'll give up. I can't.\"\n\n\"You've got to give up. That's all there is to it.\" His jaw was set like\na vise.\n\nThe party above fell upon them as they landed.\n\n\"Were you frightened, Moya?\" exclaimed Joyce above the chorus of\nquestions.\n\n\"Just for a moment.\" Moya did not look at Jack. \"Mr. Kilmeny told me it\nwould be all right.\"\n\nJack's eyes danced. \"I told her we would work out of the difficulty if\nshe would trust me.\"\n\nMoya blushed. It happened that Captain Kilmeny was looking directly at\nher when his cousin spoke.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nHOMING HEARTS\n\n\nJack Kilmeny had not been brought up in the dry sunbaked West for\nnothing. The winds of the Rockies had entered into his character as well\nas into his physique. He was a willful man, with a good deal of granite\nin his make-up. A fighter from his youth, he did not find it easy to\nyield the point upon which he differed from Moya. There was in her so\nmuch of impulsive generosity that he had expected to overpower her\nscruples. But she stood like a rock planted in the soil.\n\nIt came to him as he walked home after a long fight with her that in his\nheart he did not want her to yield. She was the Moya Dwight he loved\nbecause she would not compromise with her conviction. Yet, though he\nwanted her to stand firm, he hated the thought of giving way himself. It\ngalled his pride that he must come to her without a penny, knowing that\nshe had the means to keep them both modestly. Nor could he, without a\npang, think of surrendering the twenty-eight thousand dollars he had\nfought for and won. He was no visionary. The value of money he\nunderstood perfectly. It stood for power, place, honor, the things that\nwere worth having. Given what he had, Jack knew he could double it in\nGoldbanks within the year. There were legitimate opportunities for\ninvestment that were bound to make rich returns. But without a dollar he\nwould be like Samson shorn of his locks.\n\nAll through the night he was joined in battle with himself, but when at\nearly dawn he stood on the top of Son-of-a-Gun hill and faced a sky\nfaintly pink with the warning of a coming sun his decision had been\nmade.\n\nOn his way back he met Moya and Miss Seldon. Joyce pounced upon him with\na grievance.\n\n\"You haven't told me yet how much you're going to give for the new\nhospital, Mr. Kilmeny. You know we're leaving to-morrow, and you'll have\nto decide at once. Be generous, please. You said yourself it was a good\ncause.\"\n\nHe nodded agreement. \"The most worthy charity I know. I've often\nwondered why some Andrew Carnegie didn't set the fashion of endowing\nhospitals by wholesale. They ought to be free to all poor folks out of\nhealth. When a man is losing his wages and his family is scrimping he\nought not to be facing a thirty-dollar-a-week hospital charge. Yes, I'm\nfor the new hospital, Miss Seldon.\"\n\n\"How strong are you for it?\" Joyce asked, laughing at her newly acquired\nAmerican slang. \"Mr. Verinder has promised to give me two dollars for\nevery one I can raise among my other friends. So don't be a--a----\"\n\n\"A tightwad,\" supplied Moya with a smile. She could do a little in the\nnative slang herself.\n\nJack went into his pocket for a checkbook and a fountain pen. He wrote\nfor a few seconds, tore the check from the stub, and handed it to Joyce.\n\nThat young woman gasped.\n\n\"Why--you don't really mean--it's for twenty-eight thousand two hundred\nand fourteen dollars,\" she cried.\n\n\"And seventeen cents. Please don't forget that,\" he added.\n\n\"But--what on earth do you mean?\"\n\nJack was looking at Moya, and she at him with shining eyes in which joy\nswam.\n\n\"It's a little thank offering, Miss Seldon.\"\n\n\"Because you were rescued from the mine, I suppose. Still....\"\n\n\"Because I'm engaged to be married to the best woman in the world,\" he\ncorrected.\n\nJoyce whirled upon Moya with instant divination. \"You little wretch, and\nyou never told me.\"\n\nIf Miss Dwight had not known it herself till this moment she gave no\nsign to that effect. \"We're telling you now, dear,\" she explained.\n\n\"How long have you been engaged? Was it yesterday in the bucket?\"\n\nJack laughed. \"Nothing so romantic. We've been engaged a little less\nthan half a minute. You get the first chance to wish Moya joy on having\nwon so great a catch. She's marrying a pauper, you know.\"\n\n\"I think we're very rich,\" differed his sweetheart shyly.\n\nJoyce looked from one to the other suspiciously. \"I haven't a notion\nwhat either of you mean, but I know I'm going to hang on to this check,\nMr. Millionaire Pauper.\"\n\nImps of mischief sparkled in the highgrader's eyes. \"Don't forget that\nVerinder has to write one for twice as much.\"\n\nMiss Seldon could not help laughing. \"I'll see to that. He's not a\nwelcher, but ... I wonder how he'll look when I tell him.\"\n\n\"You ought to tell him as soon as you can,\" Jack hinted boldly.\n\n\"Oh, ought I? Did you say you had been engaged less than a minute, Mr.\nKilmeny? How much will you give me to go down now and tell him?\"\n\n\"I've nothing left to give--except my gratitude.\"\n\n\"You're the first man who ever was so ungallant as to tell me he would\nbe grateful to have me leave him.\"\n\n\"I'm the first who ever proposed to another girl in your presence. The\ncircumstance is unusual,\" he flung back gayly.\n\n\"I didn't hear you propose. All you did was to announce it,\" she replied\nsaucily.\n\n\"That's true too,\" admitted Kilmeny. \"Well, I'm going to propose now if\nit isn't too late. You may stay if you like.\"\n\n\"Thanks, no.\" Joyce kissed her friend. \"I hope you'll be very happy,\ndear. I ... I believe you will.\"\n\nMoya choked on her words. \"I know I shall, Joy.\"\n\nMiss Seldon looked at Jack with an expression in which embarrassment and\naudacity were blended. \"I've always rather liked your pauper,\" she\nconfided aloud to Moya.\n\nHer confidences had their limits. She omitted to mention what had just\npopped into her mind, that within the fortnight he had proposed to her\ntoo on the same spot.\n\nJack bowed with exaggerated deference when she shook hands with him. He\nwas just now riding the seventh wave of happiness and felt friendly to\nthe whole world.\n\n\"Thanks very much. You're a good scout, Joyce.\"\n\n\"Good gracious! What may that be? Some more of your American slang, I\nsuppose.\" She broke away from persiflage to add seriously: \"You're\nright about one thing, though. You've got the best girl in the world. Be\ngood to her, Jack Kilmeny.\"\n\nWith that she turned and walked down the hill.\n\nThe other two walked up.\n\n\"I'm so proud of you, Jack, boy,\" whispered one of them.\n\nHe laughed happily. \"I'm proud of myself. I've done the best day's work\nI ever did for myself when I won Moya Dwight.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, Jack. What other man would have thrown away a\nsmall fortune--all he had--just for me?\"\n\n\"I can name one other,\" suggested Kilmeny.\n\n\"Ned! But he's a saint.\"\n\n\"And I'm a sinner,\" her lover replied blithely.\n\n\"You're the sinner I love, then.\"\n\nThey had reached a clump of firs. Without knowing how it happened she\nfound herself in his arms. There were both tears and laughter in her\neyes as her lips turned slowly to meet his.\n\n\"The first time since we were kiddies on the _Victorian_, sweetheart,\"\nhe told her.\n\n\"Yes, it's true. I loved you then. I love you now.... Jack, boy, I'm\njust the happiest girl alive.\"\n\nA mist-like veil of old rose hung above the mountain tops. Hand in hand\nthey watched the rising sun pierce through it and flood the crotches of\nthe hills with God's splendid canvases. It was a part of love's egoism\nthat all this glory of the young day seemed an accompaniment to the song\nof joy that pulsed through them.\n\nLater they came to earth and babbled the nonsense that is the highest\nwisdom of lovers. They built air castles and lived in them, seeing life\nthrough a poetic ambient as a long summer day in which they should ride\nand work and play together.\n\nAt last she remembered Lady Farquhar and began to laugh.\n\n\"We must go down and tell her at once, Jack.\"\n\nHe agreed. \"Yes, let's go back and have it out. If you like you may go\nto your room and I'll tackle her alone.\"\n\n\"I'd rather go with you.\"\n\nHe delighted in her answer.\n\nFarquhar was taking an early morning stroll, arm in arm with Lady Jim,\nwhen he caught sight of them.\n\n\"Look, Di!\"\n\nBoth of the lovers knew how to walk. Lady Farquhar, watching them,\nthought she had never seen as fine a pair of untamed human beings. In\nhis step was the fine free swing of the hillman, and the young woman\nbreasted the slope lightly as a faun.\n\nThe Englishman chuckled. \"You're beaten, Di. The highwayman wins.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she retorted sharply, but with anxiety manifest in her\nfrown.\n\n\"Fact, just the same. He's coming to tell us he means to take our little\ngirl to his robber den.\"\n\n\"I believe you'd actually let him,\" she said scornfully.\n\n\"Even you can't stop him. It's written in the books. Not sure I'd\ninterfere if I could. For a middle-aged Pharisee with the gout I'm\nincurably romantic. It's the child's one great chance for happiness. But\nI wish to the deuce he wasn't a highgrader.\"\n\n\"She shan't sacrifice herself if I can prevent it,\" Lady Farquhar\ninsisted stanchly.\n\n\"I 'member a girl who sacrificed herself for a line lieutenant without a\nshilling to call his own,\" he soliloquized aloud. \"Would have him, and\ndid, by Jove! Three deaths made him Lord Farquhar later, but she married\nthe penniless subaltern.\"\n\n\"I've always been glad I did.\" She squeezed his arm fondly."}

{"ID": 855, "text": " Smiles\nof late have been faint and feeble on the face of the affianced young lady, who isn't playing\nher part as a person with ancestors ought to play it. She bounced her old beau and took unto\nherself a new one, and what I can't understand is, having done it, why she doesn't carry it\noff with a rip-roaring bluff that might fool even herself for a while.  But Elizabeth isn't\nthat sort.  Everybody is talking about how miserable she looks.  I'm afraid I put the beau\nidea in her head, and the idea has got her in a hole and she doesn't know how to get out of\nit.  I wish Billy was here.  He can get a person out of any sort of hole.\n\nI went to the party with Whythe.  He has been away for a week, and while away got a new dress\nsuit, which, of course, he wore to the party and looked perfectly grand in it.  I think his\nmother gave the suit to him, though he didn't say, but he was off attending to some business\nfor her, and I'm sure he took it out in the new clothes.  It would have been more sensible\nto have had his teeth fixed, or gotten three new ones, the rest being all right, but it was\nnatural to prefer the suit, and much less painful.  Whythe is never going to do anything disagreeable\nthat he can keep from doing.\n\nHe was so nice the night of the party that I hadn't the courage to begin finding out the truth\nor untruth of what Mr. Willie Prince had mentioned as the reason of the rush he had been giving\nme, and as I don't believe Whythe has ever thought of Father's money, there was no need to\nbe in a hurry to learn whether he had or not.  I've had a jolly good time being in love with\nhim, and being made love to, and as an experience it may come in when I begin to write my book.\nI always did want to know how many ways love can be made in, which, of course, I can never\nknow, for there are as many ways, I guess, as there are men to make it, and the variations\non the main theme are as infinitesimal as the tongues that tell the story.  It is truly wonderful\nhow differently the same words can be trimmed up and handed out, and I like the crescendoes\nand diminuendoes and shades of feeling which give emphasis and expression, as my music teacher\nsays I must be careful of when playing.  There is never going to be any crescendo or diminuendo\nbusiness about Billy's love-making, and I might as well make up my mind to that in the beginning.\nIt's going to be pure staccato with him--short and quick and soon over.  But it will last forever,\nBilly's will.  He isn't going to stand for foolishness about it when he starts, either.  He\nhas two more years at college and then he is going in his father's office.\n\nI don't know what's the matter with Billy.  I haven't had a letter from him for a week, or\na single card.  He must be crazy.  I've been so busy I have not written for ten days, and if\nI don't get a letter soon he won't get one from me for another ten.  He can't expect me to\ndo what he doesn't do, and besides, a man doesn't want what he gets too easy, even letters.\nI don't suppose he could be sick.  If he was--  I am not going to let myself think sickness\nor automobile accidents or sliding off mountain peaks (they are in Switzerland now and Billy\nwould get to the top of anything he started for or die trying).  And though I say to myself\nforty times a day he is all right, I wake up at night and wonder if anything could be the matter.\nI am wondering all the time.\n\nMaybe that is why I was a little nicer to Whythe at the party than I need to have been, because\nI wanted to forget something it was not well to remember if I was out to enjoy myself.  After\nI had danced with half a dozen boys and spoken to everybody on the place, we went out on the\nlawn, Whythe and I, and sat on a rustic seat under a great maple-tree to cool off and rest\nawhile; and though everybody could see us and several couples were under several other trees\n(a number of cases being on hand and apt to culminate in August), Miss Bettie Simcoe had remarks\nto make, of course.  She made them the next day at breakfast.\n\nI wish I could buy a beau for Miss Bettie and make a present of him to her, but, being a member\nof the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, I couldn't very well do it.  I never\nyet have seen a man I would be that hard on.  But it would be the only way she could be made\nto see some things, and maybe it might make her feel young again.  Jess says there's nothing\nso kittenish as a spinster who's caught an unexpected beau.  He is the most rejuvenating thing\non earth to a woman who wants one.  All don't want them.  There are a great many more sensible\nwomen in this world than people realize, but in certain small places matrimony is still the\nchief pursuit in which women can engage without being thought unwomanly.  Miss Bettie doesn't\npursue, and men are good dodgers in this part of the world, but if one of them would say a\nfew things to her of the sort that Whythe knows how to say so well, her sniffing and snorting\nand seeing might grow less.\n\nI don't like her, but I feel sorry for her, for nobody really loves her, and it must be awful\nto have nobody to love you best of all on earth.  I couldn't live if nobody loved me.  I could\nnot.  I might live without food and live without drink, and do without clothes and do without\nair--the right kinds of those things, I mean--but I couldn't and I wouldn't live without loving.\nAs long as I am on this little planet I expect to love a lot of people and I hope they will\nlove me in return.  When Miss Bettie makes me so mad I have to go out of the room to keep from\nsaying things I shouldn't, and Miss Araminta simpers so when any one mentions Mr. Sparks's\nname (he's the new widower minister of the Presbyterian church, with no chance of escape),\nand Elizabeth Hamilton Carter makes me ashamed of my sex, and I feel like I have swallowed\nconcentrated extract of Human Peculiarities, I remember that not one of them has a father of\nany sort, much less my sort, or a precious mother and two dandy sisters and a good many nice\nrelations and some bully friends--when I remember all that, remember how many I have to love\nme, I spit out the peculiarities and try not to mind them, try to see how funny they are. \nBut sometimes the taste sticks right long.  I don't suppose I spit right.  What I can't understand\nis that if people want to be loved--and everybody does--why in the name of goodness don't they\ndo a little loving on their own account?  You needn't expect to get what you don't give.  I'm\nglad I was born with a taste for liking, though I don't like every one, by a jugful.  When\nI come across a righteous hypocrite I get out of the way, if it isn't convenient to make the\nhypocrite get out of mine.  There are some people I could never congeal with and I am never\neven going to try.\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nI wonder what made me waste time thinking about Miss Bettie Simcoe and human peculiarities\nwhen I started to say something about sitting under the trees with Whythe at the MacLean party,\nbut, born a rambler, I will ramble unto death, and there's no use wasting time lamenting natural\ndeficiencies.  Whythe, of course, couldn't very conveniently make personal remarks, as people\nwere passing pretty close, though he did say I looked like a dream, which I did not, being\ntoo brown for a dream; but I did look real nice.  I fished out one of the party dresses Mother\nmade Clarissa put in my trunk, which I haven't worn since I have been here, and I suppose it\nsuited my brownness, as it was creamy and stuck out in the silly way skirts stick now, and\nit was new-fashioned enough to make everybody look at it and nudge a little.  Whythe thought\nit was lovely, and told me so sixteen times, which was tiresome, and then I saw he was watching\nElizabeth, who was on the porch with her new beau and did not know really whether my dress\nwas blue or pink.  The only thing he was thinking of was that not far from him was a superseder\nin possession of something which was once his.  Whythe doesn't like to be superseded in anything\naffecting his personal estimate of himself.\n\nThe Lord certainly let loose a lot of contradictions when he started the human race.  When\nI saw the way Whythe was watching Elizabeth, and remembered how she had looked at him when\nhe passed her a few minutes before, I knew two specimens of a common variety were before me,\nand I made up a parable as I watched them watch each other.  The two specimens had been in\nlove and been engaged.  They had a fuss.  The engagement was broken.  She was mad, and he was\nmad, and each thought the other would make the first advance to own up and make up; but before\nit could be done a young person appeared and distracted temporarily the attention of the man,\nand the girl went away to see what she could do.  The man repaired the damage done unto him\nby saying pretty things to the new person, which was good for his pride and kept him in practice,\nand all was going well when the first maiden returned with a new possession.\n\nThe new possession was a son of great wealth, but the Faithless One was made to understand,\nwithout words, that his Cruelty was driving the Maid to Marriage with another, and his Vanity\nwas appeased, and in his heart he rejoiced and said unto himself: \"It is even as I thought,\nand that piece of punk she has brought back is bitter unto her, and in comparison to me he\nis nothingness indeed.  And I would arise and punch his head if it were not for the New Person\nwho may love me very much.\" And the young man was sorrowful when he thought on these things\nand yet glad also, for the heart of man is receptive to the love of all kinds of women, and\nit is pleasing unto him to believe he is pleasing unto them.\n\nAnd seeing that which had come to pass, the New Young Person made up her mind that the Young\nMan and the Young Maid who had once loved must love again, and in her heart she said it is\na vain thing to believe in the words of a man.  They cometh out as cometh breath, then pass\naway and are remembered by him no more.  And she took counsel with herself as to how she might\nbring to pass that which the simple souls knew not how to bring, and, lo! as she thought it\ncame unto her.  That's a true parable!\n\nWhat came was the thought of a picnic.  Whythe and Elizabeth must accidentally have a chance\nto come across each other and have it out, and the best way they could do it would be outdoors,\nwhere it is convenient to wander off and get away from nudgers and commenters; and being nothing\nbut impulse, I turned to Whythe, who was still unconsciously watching Elizabeth, and asked\nhim if he would help me with something I was anxious to do.  He said of course, and wanted\nto know what it was.  When I told him I would tell him the next day he asked me to drive with\nhim in the morning, and didn't like it because I declined.  That is, he didn't like my reason,\nwhich was that, as he had been out of his office for some time, his business must need attending\nto, and I didn't think it ought to be left any longer.  He seemed to think that a very unnecessary\nremark, and I realized he liked Elizabeth's kind better.  She would never have dreamed of telling\nhim his business needed attention.  Elizabeth is the Admired and Honored type of Womanhood\nwhich does not think it is ladylike to have knowledge of business matters.\n\nSeeing the look on his face, I said to myself: \"Kitty Canary, it is all over.  A pin has been\nstuck in your balloon and the air is out.\"  And I got up and went in and danced with every\nman dancer in the room, and hardly knew who they were, the breaks were so often.  I had a good\ntime, but also I had a right sinky feeling, for it's pretty wabbly to realize that nothing\nhuman is to be depended on very long, and that a girl may be engaged one day to a man and not\nspeaking to him the next. Not that I had ever been engaged.  I hadn't, not caring for what\ngoes with engagements, but I might have been if I hadn't remembered about the different things\nI have fallen in and been fished out of when there was some one by to haul me out.  Nobody\nbeing by, I had to take care of myself, and I thought it best to go only so far and no farther.\n\nOn the way home Whythe tried to say some things pretty low about how he had missed me while\naway, but Miss Susanna and Miss Araminta were in the back seat of the car (it was Mr. Lipscomb's\nFord, and borrowed, of course), and he had to be so careful it was a strain, and as I didn't\nanswer he stopped after a while.  It takes two to do more things than make a bargain, and to\nbattledore love without having it shuttlecocked back isn't much fun.  He wanted to know what\nwas the matter when I got out, and I told him it was sleep.  He didn't seem to like that, either.\nIt's hard to please men.\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nI didn't see Whythe for the next few days, as I thought it best not to, and, besides, I had\nbushels of letters to write and a very special one to Father, and I had no time for him.  The\nthing I had to write Father about was money.  I wanted five hundred dollars, and the only way\nI knew how to get it was to ask him to give it to me; so I asked.  I always did believe that\nthe person who gives the money ought to be told what is to be done with it, and that is why\nI wrote Father as I did; and, besides, he likes to hear little bits of news about the Twickenham-Towners,\nand asking for the money gave me a chance to tell him.\n\nHe had told me, when he was here, that if there was any way in which I could be of service\nin the right way to let him know and he would put up the money part, if I would manage the\nother part, and it would be a little secret between us and nobody else need know anything about\nit. When, last week, I heard Mrs. Richard Stafford say she would rather go to a hospital for\na month than do anything on earth, I thought my chance had come.  At the hospital, she said,\na person had the right to be waited on and do nothing, and not think about food or servants,\nand not feel they were bothering other people by being sick; and while she wasn't sick exactly,\na hospital would seem like heaven if she could be in one for a little while.  She had laughed\nwhen she said it, and didn't dream of its being taken in earnest, but I took it in earnest,\nfor the tiredness in her face makes me ache every time I see her, and right up in my mind popped\nthe little secret Father and I and Miss Polk could have.  What I wrote was this:\n\n_Father dear, will you please send me five hundred dollars, and if you can do it by return\nmail I will be very much obliged.  The person I want part of it for is so tired that she might\nnot be able to ever get rested unless she has a chance pretty quick to lie down and do nothing\nfor a month, anyhow, and that is why I am in a hurry.  Tiredness is a very wearing disease\nand if it runs on too long it runs a person into a state that is almost impossible to get out\nof, and the whole family has to pay up for letting it go on.  Home gets hell-y when there's\ntoo much tiredness in it.  What I want the money for is this: Mrs. Stafford is worn out.  You\nknow her.  She was Miss Mary Shirley, and married a perfectly useless man when she was eighteen,\nand she is now the mother of seven children, and has a mother-in-law living with her, and also\nMiss Lou Barbee, who won't go away.  And, of course, the man whom she can't turn out.  He isn't\nbad.  Just lazy, with nothing to him, but she loves him and I will skip over that part.  She\nneeds a rest and ought to have it.  It's nothing but scrimp and scrape and strive to keep up\nappearances day in and day out, year in and year out, until she is all to pieces and the children\ndon't realize what is the matter.  And, of course, the Male Person doesn't, for he says that\nWoman's Place is in the Home.  When he told me that yesterday (his heels were on the railing\nof his porch, where he generally keeps them, and his pipe in his mouth) I thought to myself\nthat if he were mine he would have to get out of my home or prove he had a better right to\nshare it with me than he had ever proved to his wife.  But I won't get on that, either. I'll\ngo back to Mrs. Stafford._\n\n_Half the time she doesn't have a servant, and all the time she has a mother-in-law, who is\npie crust, and Miss Lou Barbee, who's a bagpipe, and with the doors locked and windows shut\nso no one can see, she has worked herself to death.  What I want done is to have an invitation\nsent her from an old friend to be the guest of the hospital here for a month, and you will\nbe the friend and she will never know it.  Miss Polk, the superintendent of the hospital, will\nmanage things.  I've talked it over with her, and she understands.  Miss Polk is a perfectly\ngrand person.  For Simon-pure sense there isn't her equal on earth. She and I have decided\non what we would do if we had money.  We'd have a Fund for Tired Mothers and Fathers.  It would\nbe used to give them a Rest before Death._\n\n_I hope you won't mind sending the money.  I don't think you will, for everybody says business\nis so prosperous it's actually unrighteous, and it's in the Bible that you ought to put your\ntreasures where you can find them again, or something like that.  If you can't send it I know\nthere will be a good reason for your not sending it, but I would like to have it by Monday\nif possible, so Mrs. Stafford can go to the Hospital the next day.  Later, four other people\ncan have their turn. It is to be used not for illness, but for Tiredness; for broken-downers\nand worn-outers who need being waited on and fed up and allowed to keep still.  Miss Polk and\nI are going to decide on who needs a rest the most before I go away, and I send you for it,\nFather dear, an armful of squeezes and the biggest bunch of kisses the mail-man can take._\n\nThat was all I told him about the Rest money, but I said a little something about the picnic\nI thought I ought to give.  Everybody in town has given something, and, having accepted, I\nhave to return, and the picnic will be the best thing for Whythe and Elizabeth.  I didn't mention\nthe ex-lovers to Father, of course.  Even to a father one doesn't have to tell everything in life.\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nI haven't seen Whythe alone but once since the night of the MacLean party, and then I stopped\nany tendencies that showed signs of being personal, and talked most of the time about the picnic\nwhich we can't have until late in the month.  Every day is engaged up to the twenty-fourth.\nWhythe tried to talk of Mr. Algernon Grice Baker, but I cut that out also.  Sarcasm doesn't\nsuit him, and some day he might be sorry.  The Superseder has gone, however, and every day\nElizabeth passes Whythe's office, and every day Whythe happens to be at his window at the time\nof passing.  They speak, but so far that is all.  I am sorry the picnic has to wait so long.\nThey are two silly children. Their fingers aren't in their mouths, but their heads are on the\nside when they see each other, and the thing's getting on my nerves.  Almost any kind of sin\nis easier to stand than some sorts of silliness.\n\nI wonder why I stay awake so much at night!  It's very unusual, and I try my best to go to\nsleep, but I can't sleep.  Always I am thinking of Mr. William Spencer Sloane and the things\nI would say to him if he were in hearing distance.  Not one line have I had from him for more\nthan two weeks.  Not a card or a little present, which he usually sends from every place he\ngoes to, or any sign to show he is living.  I got so mad when I realized he hadn't noticed\nme for fourteen days that I couldn't keep in things which had to come out, and, seeing Miss\nSusanna was sleeping the sleep of worn-outness, I got up the other night and lighted a candle\nbehind the bed, and on the floor I wrote a letter that maybe wasn't altogether as accurate\nas it might have been.  I wouldn't have sent it the next day if it hadn't been for a letter\nI got from Jess, but after I read hers I sent mine flying.\n\nI haven't cooled down yet from reading Jess's letter.  I am not going to cool down until I\nsee the cause of it face to face, and if Billy thinks it makes the least difference to me how\nhe amuses himself or with whom he spends his time sightseeing he thinks Wrong!  I was going\nto tear up the letter I had written him in the middle of the night for the relief of indignations\nand because in the middle of the night things seem so much bigger and harder and stranger than\nin the daylight; but after I read the letter from Jess I added a postscript to mine and almost\nran down to the post-office to mail it, for fear if I didn't do it quick I mightn't do it at\nall.  Ever since I sent it off I have been perfectly horrid, and I can hardly stand myself.\nI have put off trying to make Whythe and Elizabeth see how stupid they are, and as Elizabeth\nhasn't been very nice to me I haven't felt it to be my duty to show her what a goose she is.\nNeither have I told Whythe that almost any girl who adored him would do for his wife.  As I\ndon't adore I wouldn't do, and I think he is beginning to take it in.  A dozen times of late\nhe has told me he doesn't understand me.  He does not. And never will.\n\nThe thing in Jess's letter which made me hot was this: \"What is the matter with you and Billy?\nPat says (Pat is Patricia, Billy's sister) that you've been pretty horrid about writing him,\nand he's been blue-black at not getting letters from you; but at present he is having a good\ntime with a very jolly girl from the West who is at their hotel. Chirp him something cheerful,\nCanary Bird.  If I were younger or Billy older you shouldn't have him.  I'd have him myself.\nI'm not going to stand for bad treatment of him, and if those Southern boys who make love to\nevery pretty girl they see, and make it better than any boys on earth, have made you forget\nan old friend, I'm coming down and take you back home.  Behave yourself, Kitty Canary, and\nwrite Billy the sort of letter we scream over up here.\"  And then she went on with other things.\n\nIt is ridiculous in Pat to say I haven't written Billy!  I have.  Three long letters and three\ncards, and certainly he can't expect more than that, as he hasn't been gone but two months\nand five days; and, besides, friends ought to have such confidence in each other that they\ndon't need letters to prove their friendship.  Not a word have I had from him in more than\ntwo weeks, and if Jess thinks I am going to write him a chirp letter (which he won't have time\nto read if he is going around so much with a Western girl and having so much fun) she, too,\nthinks Wrong.  That Westerner explains why I haven't heard from him for so long."}
{"ID": 361, "text": "The late campaign, short as it has fortunately been, becomes important, if viewed with reference\nto a subject to which we have more than once before alluded,[22] but which cannot be too often\nor too prominently brought before the British public, who should never be suffered to lose\nsight of the great truth, that it is _by our military power alone_ that we hold our Indian\nempire. It is evident from all the circumstances, not less than from the candid confession\nof Sir Hugh Gough himself, that the determined resistance opposed by the Gwalior troops, (whom\nof late years it has been the fashion in the Indian army to speak of as \"Sindiah's rabble,\")\nand the discipline and valour shown in the defence of their positions, were wholly unexpected\nby their assailants. But the prowess and unflinching resolution displayed at Maharajpoor and\nPunniar, under all the disadvantages of a desperate cause and inefficient commanders, were\nworthy of the troops of De Boigne and Perron in their best days, and amply prove that the Mahrattas\nof the present day have not degenerated from their fathers, whose conduct at Assye won the\npraise of the great Duke himself.[23] The defeat of British force in a pitched battle on the\nsoil of India, would be a calamity of which no man could calculate the consequences; yet such\na result would not have been impossible, if the contempt of our commanders for the enemy had\nbrought them to the encounter with inadequate numbers; and the rulers of India have reason\nto congratulate themselves that this underrated force remained quiescent during our Affghan\ndisasters, when intrigue and difficulties were at their height among both Hindoos and Moslems,\nand every disposable regiment was engaged beyond the Indus, in a warfare, of the speedy termination\nof which there then appeared little prospect; while the Moslems, both of the north and south,\nin Rohilcund and the Dekkan, were on the verge of insurrection, the Rajah of Sattarah, the\nrepresentative of the former head of that great Mahratta confederacy, of which Sindiah was\nthen the only member retaining any degree of independence, was busied in conspiracies, the\nabsurdity of the proposed means for which was not[24] (as some of his advocates in England\nattempted to maintain) a proof of their non-existence. Had the old Mahratta spirit been then\nalive in the breast of the degenerate successor of Dowlut Rao, the appearance in the field\nof 20,000 troops with a considerable share of discipline, and a numerous and excellent artillery,\nmight at once have given the signal, and formed a nucleus, for a rising which would have comprehended\nalmost every man who could bear arms, and would have shaken to the centre, if not overthrown\nutterly, the mighty fabric of our Eastern empire. It is true that the indolent and sensual\ncharacter of Jankojee Sindiah gave no grounds for apprehension at the time; and the period\nof danger has now passed away; nor is it probable that the Gwalior army, even if left at its\npresent strength, can ever again be in a situation to give trouble to our government."}

{"ID": 1352, "text": "\nSince the earthquake of 1687 the crops of maize on the Peruvian coast\nhave been very inconsiderable. In the mountainous parts it is somewhat\nmore abundant, but still far from sufficient to supply the wants of the\ncountry. Chile supplies, in return for sugar, the maize required in\nPeru. Of the other kinds of grain barley only is raised; but it does not\nthrive on the coast, and is cultivated successfully at the height of\nfrom 7000 to 13,200 feet above the level of the sea. The assertion of\nsome travellers, that barley was known to the Peruvians before the\narrival of the Spaniards, is groundless. It is true that barley is\nsometimes found in pots in Indian graves. Those graves, however, as I\nhave had repeated opportunities of being convinced, belong, without\nexception, to modern times, chiefly to the seventeenth century.\n\nPotatoes are not planted on the coast, where, it appears, the climate\nand soil are unfavorable to them. In those parts they are small and\nwatery. On the higher ridges which intersect the coast at short\ndistances from the sea, the potatoe grows wild. I am inclined to believe\nthat the root is indigenous in these parts, as well as in Chiloe and\nChile, and that the ancient Peruvians did not obtain this root from the\nsouth, but that they removed it from their own high lands in order to\ncultivate it on a more favorable soil.[40] The best potatoe grows about\ntwenty-two leagues from Lima, in Huamantanga, which is about 7000 feet\nabove the level of the sea, to the north-west of the Quebrada of Canta.\nThis potatoe is small and round, with a thin white skin, and when\nbisected the color is a clear bright yellow. It is called the _Papa\namarilla_, and there is much demand for it in the markets, where it\nfetches a good price. The other potatoes come chiefly from the Quebrada\nof Huarochirin, and they are very well flavored.\n\nThe Camotes (_Convolvulus batatas_, L.), not improperly called sweet\npotatoes, grow to a considerable size. There are two kinds of camotes,\nthe yellow and the violet; the latter are called _Camotes moradas_.\nThese two kinds are much liked for their excellent flavor. Beyond the\nheight of 3500 feet above the level of the sea they cease to grow.\n\nThe Aracacha (_Conium moschatum_, H. B. Kth.) grows on the coast, but it\nis more abundant on the projecting ridges of the Cordilleras, and on the\neastern declivity of the Andes. It is a very agreeable and nutritive\nkind of tuberous vegetable, in flavor not unlike celery. It is cooked by\nbeing either simply boiled in water, or made into a kind of soup. In\nmany districts the aracacha yields two crops in the year."}

Whereupon Mr. Skinyer left him without further\nquestioning, the rector's brain being evidently unfit\nfor the subject of corporation law.\n\nOn the other hand he got satisfaction from the Rev.

Of course nothing\nwhatever was said during the lunch about the churches or\ntheir finances or anything concerning them. Such discussion\nwould have been a gross business impropriety. A few days\nlater the two brothers Overend dined with Mr. Furlong\nsenior, the dinner being charged directly to the\ncontingencies account of St. Asaph's. After which Mr.\nSkinyer and his partner, Mr. Beatem, went to the spring\nraces together on the Profit and Loss account of St.\nOsoph's, and Philippa Overend and Catherine Dumfarthing\nwere taken (by the Unforeseen Disbursements Account) to\nthe grand opera, followed by a midnight supper.\n\nAll of these things constituted what was called the\npromotion of the merger and were almost exactly identical\nwith the successive stages of the making of the Amalgamated\nDistilleries and the Associated Tin Pot Corporation;\nwhich was considered a most hopeful sign.\n\n        *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n\"Do you think they'll go into it?\" asked Mr. Newberry of\nMr. Furlong senior, anxiously. \"After all, what inducement\nhave they?\"\n\n\"Every inducement,\" said Mr. Furlong. \"All said and done\nthey've only one large asset--Dr. Dumfarthing. We're\nreally offering to buy up Dr. Dumfarthing by pooling our\nassets with theirs.\"\n\n\"And what does Dr. Dumfarthing himself say to it?\"\n\n\"Ah, there I am not so sure,\" said Mr. Furlong; \"that\nmay be a difficulty. So far there hasn't been a word from\nhim, and his trustees are absolutely silent about his\nviews. However, we shall soon know all about it. Skinyer\nis asking us all to come together one evening next week\nto draw up the articles of agreement.\"\n\n\"Has he got the financial basis arranged then?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" said Mr. Furlong. \"His idea is to form\na new corporation to be known as the United Church Limited\nor by some similar name. All the present mortgagees will\nbe converted into unified bondholders, the pew rents will\nbe capitalized into preferred stock and the common stock,\ndrawing its dividend from the offertory, will be distributed\namong all members in standing. Skinyer says that it is\nreally an ideal form of church union, one that he thinks\nis likely to be widely adopted. It has the advantage of\nremoving all questions of religion, which he says are\npractically the only remaining obstacle to a union of\nall the churches. In fact it puts the churches once and\nfor all on a business basis.\"\n\n\"But what about the question of doctrine, of belief?\"\nasked Mr. Newberry.\n\n\"Skinyer says he can settle it,\" answered Mr. Furlong.\n\n        *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\nAbout a week after the above conversation the united\ntrustees of St. Asaph's and St. Osoph's were gathered\nabout a huge egg-shaped table in the board room of the\nMausoleum Club. They were seated in intermingled fashion\nafter the precedent of the recent Tin Pot Amalgamation\nand were smoking huge black cigars specially kept by the\nclub for the promotion of companies and chargeable to\nexpenses of organization at fifty cents a cigar. There\nwas an air of deep peace brooding over the assembly, as\namong men who have accomplished a difficult and meritorious\ntask.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Mr. Skinyer, who was in the chair,\nwith a pile of documents in front of him, \"I think that\nour general basis of financial union may be viewed as\nsettled.\"\n\nA murmur of assent went round the meeting. \"The terms\nare set forth in the memorandum before us, which you have\nalready signed. Only one other point--a minor one--remains\nto be considered. I refer to the doctrines or the religious\nbelief of the new amalgamation.\"\n\n\"Is it necessary to go into that?\" asked Mr. Boulder.\n\n\"Not entirely, perhaps,\" said Mr. Skinyer. \"Still there\nhave been, as you all know, certain points--I won't say\nof disagreement--but let us say of friendly\nargument--between the members of the different\nchurches--such things for example,\" here he consulted\nhis papers, \"as the theory of the creation, the salvation\nof the soul, and so forth, have been mentioned in this\nconnection. I have a memorandum of them here, though the\npoints escape me for the moment. These, you may say, are\nnot matters of first importance, especially as compared\nwith the intricate financial questions which we have\nalready settled in a satisfactory manner. Still I think\nit might be well if I were permitted with your unanimous\napproval to jot down a memorandum or two to be afterwards\nembodied in our articles.\"\n\nThere was a general murmur of approval. \"Very good,\" said\nMr. Skinyer, settling himself back in his chair. \"Now,\nfirst, in regard to the creation,\" here he looked all\nround the meeting in a way to command attention--\"Is it\nyour wish that we should leave that merely to a gentlemen's\nagreement or do you want an explicit clause?\"\n\n\"I think it might be well,\" said Mr. Dick Overend, \"to\nleave no doubt about the theory of the creation.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Skinyer. \"I am going to put it down then\nsomething after this fashion: 'On and after, let us say,\nAugust 1st proximo, the process of the creation shall be\nheld, and is hereby held, to be such and such only as is\nacceptable to a majority of the holders of common and\npreferred stock voting pro rata.' Is that agreed?\"\n\n\"Carried,\" cried several at once.\n\n\"Carried,\" repeated Mr. Skinyer. \"Now let us pass on\"--here\nhe consulted his notes--\"to item two, eternal punishment.\nI have made a memorandum as follows, 'Should any doubts\narise, on or after August first proximo, as to the\nexistence of eternal punishment they shall be settled\nabsolutely and finally by a pro-rata vote of all the\nholders of common and preferred stock.' Is that agreed?\"\n\n\"One moment!\" said Mr. Fyshe, \"do you think that quite\nfair to the bondholders? After all, as the virtual holders\nof the property, they are the persons most interested.\nI should like to amend your clause and make it read--I\nam not phrasing it exactly but merely giving the sense\nof it--that eternal punishment should be reserved for\nthe mortgagees and bondholders.\"\n\nAt this there was an outbreak of mingled approval and\ndissent, several persons speaking at once. In the opinion\nof some the stockholders of the company, especially the\npreferred stockholders, had as good a right to eternal\npunishment as the bondholders. Presently Mr. Skinyer,\nwho had been busily writing notes, held up his hand for\nsilence.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"will you accept this as a compromise?\nWe will keep the original clause but merely add to it\nthe words, 'but no form of eternal punishment shall be\ndeclared valid if displeasing to a three-fifths majority\nof the holders of bonds.'\"\n\n\"Carried, carried,\" cried everybody.\n\n\"To which I think we need only add,\" said Mr. Skinyer,\n\"a clause to the effect that all other points of doctrine,\nbelief or religious principle may be freely altered,\namended, reversed or entirely abolished at any general\nannual meeting!\"\n\nThere was a renewed chorus of \"Carried, carried,\" and\nthe trustees rose from the table shaking hands with one\nanother, and lighting fresh cigars as they passed out of\nthe club into the night air.\n\n\"The only thing that I don't understand,\" said Mr. Newberry\nto Dr. Boomer as they went out from the club arm in arm\n(for they might now walk in that fashion with the same\npropriety as two of the principals in a distillery merger),\n\"the only thing that I don't understand is why the Reverend\nMr. Dumfarthing should be willing to consent to the\namalgamation.\"\n\n\"Do you really not know?\" said Dr. Boomer.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You have heard nothing?\"\n\n\"Not a word,\" said Mr. Newberry.\n\n\"Ah,\" rejoined the president, \"I see that our men have\nkept it very quiet--naturally so, in view of the\ncircumstances. The truth is that the Reverend Mr.\nDumfarthing is leaving us.\"\n\n\"Leaving St. Osoph's!\" exclaimed Mr. Newberry in utter\nastonishment.\n\n\"To our great regret. He has had a call--a most inviting\nfield of work, he says, a splendid opportunity. They\noffered him ten thousand one hundred; we were only giving\nhim ten thousand here, though of course that feature of\nthe situation would not weigh at all with a man like\nDumfarthing.\"\n\n\"Oh no, of course not,\" said Mr. Newberry.\n\n\"As soon as we heard of the call we offered him ten\nthousand three hundred--not that that would make any\ndifference to a man of his character. Indeed Dumfarthing\nwas still waiting and looking for guidance when they\noffered him eleven thousand. We couldn't meet it. It was\nbeyond us, though we had the consolation of knowing that\nwith such a man as Dumfarthing the money made no\ndifference.\"\n\n\"And he has accepted the call?\"\n\n\"Yes. He accepted it today. He sent word to Mr. Dick\nOverend our chairman, that he would remain in his manse,\nlooking for light, until two-thirty, after which, if we\nhad not communicated with him by that hour, he would\ncease to look for it.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Mr. Newberry, deep in reflection, \"so\nthat when your trustees came to the meeting--\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Dr. Boomer--and something like a smile\npassed across his features for a moment \"Dr. Dumfarthing\nhad already sent away his telegram of acceptance.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" said Mr. Newberry, \"at the time of our\ndiscussion tonight, you were in the position of having\nno minister.\"\n\n\"Not at all. We had already appointed a successor.\"\n\n\"A successor?\"\n\n\"Certainly. It will be in tomorrow morning's papers. The\nfact is that we decided to ask Dr. McTeague to resume\nhis charge.\"\n\n\"Dr. McTeague!\" repeated Mr. Newberry in amazement. \"But\nsurely his mind is understood to be--\"\n\n\"Oh not at all,\" interrupted Dr. Boomer. \"His mind appears\nif anything, to be clearer and stronger than ever. Dr.\nSlyder tells us that paralysis of the brain very frequently\nhas this effect; it soothes the brain--clears it, as it\nwere, so that very often intellectual problems which\noccasioned the greatest perplexity before present no\ndifficulty whatever afterwards. Dr. McTeague, I believe,\nfinds no trouble now in reconciling St. Paul's dialectic\nwith Hegel as he used to. He says that so far as he can\nsee they both mean the same thing.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Mr. Newberry, \"and will Dr. McTeague\nalso resume his philosophical lectures at the university?\"\n\n\"We think it wiser not,\" said the president. \"While we\nfeel that Dr. McTeague's mind is in admirable condition\nfor clerical work we fear that professorial duties might\nstrain it. In order to get the full value of his remarkable\nintelligence, we propose to elect him to the governing\nbody of the university. There his brain will be safe\nfrom any shock. As a professor there would always be the\nfear that one of his students might raise a question in\nhis class. This of course is not a difficulty that arises\nin the pulpit or among the governors of the university.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Mr. Newberry.\n\n        *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\nThus was constituted the famous union or merger of the\nchurches of St. Asaph and St. Osoph, viewed by many of\nthose who made it as the beginning of a new era in the\nhistory of the modern church.\n\nThere is no doubt that it has been in every way an eminent\nsuccess.\n\nRivalry, competition, and controversies over points of\ndogma have become unknown on Plutoria Avenue. The\nparishioners of the two churches may now attend either\nof them just as they like. As the trustees are fond of\nexplaining it doesn't make the slightest difference. The\nentire receipts of the churches, being now pooled, are\ndivided without reference to individual attendance. At\neach half year there is issued a printed statement which\nis addressed to the shareholders of the United Churches\nLimited and is hardly to be distinguished in style or\nmaterial from the annual and semi-annual reports of the\nTin Pot Amalgamation and the United Hardware and other\nquasi-religious bodies of the sort. \"Your directors,\"\nthe last of these documents states, \"are happy to inform\nyou that in spite of the prevailing industrial depression\nthe gross receipts of the corporation have shown such an\nincrease as to justify the distribution of a stock dividend\nof special Offertory Stock Cumulative, which will be\noffered at par to all holders of common or preferred\nshares. You will also be gratified to learn that the\ndirectors have voted unanimously in favour of a special\npresentation to the Rev. Uttermust Dumfarthing on the\noccasion of his approaching marriage. It was earnestly\ndebated whether this gift should take the form, as at\nfirst suggested, of a cash presentation, or as afterwards\nsuggested, of a written testimonial in the form of an\naddress. The latter course was finally adopted as being\nmore fitting to the circumstances and the address has\naccordingly been prepared, setting forth to the Rev. Dr.\nDumfarthing, in old English lettering and wording, the\nopinion which is held of him by his former parishioners.\"\n\nThe \"approaching marriage\" referred of course to Dr.\nDumfarthing's betrothal to Juliana Furlong. It was not\nknown that he had ever exactly proposed to her. But it\nwas understood that before giving up his charge he drew\nher attention, in very severe terms, to the fact that,\nas his daughter was now leaving him, he must either have\nsomeone else to look after his manse or else be compelled\nto incur the expense of a paid housekeeper. This latter\nalternative, he said, was not one that he cared to\ncontemplate. He also reminded her that she was now at a\ntime of life when she could hardly expect to pick and\nchoose and that her spiritual condition was one of, at\nleast, great uncertainty. These combined statements are\nheld, under the law of Scotland at any rate, to be\nequivalent to an offer of marriage.\n\nCatherine Dumfarthing did not join her father in his new\nmanse. She first remained behind him, as the guest of\nPhilippa Overend for a few weeks while she was occupied\nin packing up her things. After that she stayed for\nanother two or three weeks to unpack them. This had been\nrendered necessary by a conversation held with the Reverend\nEdward Fareforth Furlong, in a shaded corner of the\nOverend's garden. After which, in due course of time,\nCatherine and Edward were married, the ceremony being\nperformed by the Reverend Dr. McTeague whose eyes filled\nwith philosophical tears as he gave them his blessing.\n\nSo the two churches of St. Asaph and St. Osoph stand side\nby side united and at peace. Their bells call softly back\nand forward to one another on Sunday mornings and such\nis the harmony between them that even the episcopal rooks\nin the elm trees of St. Asaph's and the presbyterian\ncrows in the spruce trees of St. Osoph's are known to\nexchange perches on alternate Sundays.\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT: The Great Fight for Clean Government\n\n\"As to the government of this city,\" said Mr. Newberry,\nleaning back in a leather armchair at the Mausoleum Club\nand lighting a second cigar, \"it's rotten, that's all.\"\n\n\"Absolutely rotten,\" assented Mr. Dick Overend, ringing\nthe bell for a second whiskey and soda.\n\n\"Corrupt,\" said Mr. Newberry, between two puffs of his\ncigar.\n\n\"Full of graft,\" said Mr. Overend, flicking his ashes\ninto the grate.\n\n\"Crooked aldermen,\" said Mr. Newberry.\n\n\"A bum city solicitor,\" said Mr. Overend, \"and an infernal\ngrafter for treasurer.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented Mr. Newberry, and then, leaning forwards\nin his chair and looking carefully about the corridors\nof the club, he spoke behind his hand and said, \"And the\nmayor's the biggest grafter of the lot. And what's more,\"\nhe added, sinking his voice to a whisper, \"the time has\ncome to speak out about it fearlessly.\"\n\nMr. Overend nodded. \"It's a tyranny,\" he said.\n\n\"Worse than Russia,\" rejoined Mr. Newberry.\n\n        *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\nThey had been sitting in a quiet corner of the club--it\nwas on a Sunday evening--and had fallen into talking,\nfirst of all, of the present rottenness of the federal\npolitics of the United States--not argumentatively or with\nany heat, but with the reflective sadness that steals\nover an elderly man when he sits in the leather armchair\nof a comfortable club smoking a good cigar and musing on\nthe decadence of the present day. The rottenness of the\nfederal government didn't anger them. It merely grieved\nthem.\n\nThey could remember--both of them--how different everything\nwas when they were young men just entering on life. When\nMr. Newberry and Mr. Dick Overend were young, men went\ninto congress from pure patriotism; there was no such\nthing as graft or crookedness, as they both admitted, in\nthose days; and as for the United States Senate--here\ntheir voices were almost hushed in awe--why, when they\nwere young, the United States Senate--\n\nBut no, neither of them could find a phrase big enough\nfor their meaning.\n\nThey merely repeated \"as for the United States Senate--\"\nand then shook their heads and took long drinks of whiskey\nand soda.\n\nThen, naturally, speaking of the rottenness of the federal\ngovernment had led them to talk of the rottenness of the\nstate legislature."}

{"ID": 111, "text": "In this last example, some individuals are so crazy as to believe that even God himself derives pleasure from harmony. Additionally, there exist philosophers who have convinced themselves that the movement of celestial bodies creates harmonious sounds. These instances clearly indicate that one's perception is influenced by their mental state, or rather they mistake the products of their imagination for actual objects. Thus, it is not surprising that disputes and skepticism have emerged, as although humans share similarities in many areas, differences also exist. Consequently, what appears favorable to one may appear disorganized to another, and what brings joy to one may bring discomfort to another."}

I.--_Matth\u00e6i Parisiensis, Monachi Sancti Albani, Chronica Majora._\nEdited by Henry Richards Luard, D.D., Fellow of Trinity College,\nRegistrary of the University, and Vicar of Great St. Mary's, Cambridge.\nPublished by the Authority of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's\nTreasury, under the direction of the Master of the Rolls. 7 vols. 8vo.\nLondon, Vol. I. 1872--Vol. VII. 1883.\n\n\nSome of our readers are not likely yet to have forgotten the remarkable\nessay which the late Professor Brewer contributed to our pages in 1871,\nand which has since been reprinted in the volume of 'English Studies,'\npublished shortly after the author's death in 1879. English History owes\na larger debt to few men of our time than it owes to Mr. Brewer. As a\nteacher whose pupils were always eager to listen to all that fell from\nhis lips, and whose enthusiasm never failed to awake a kindred spark in\nthe minds of those who looked to him for light in dark places and\nguidance along tortuous paths of research, Mr. Brewer has had few\nequals, and perhaps has left no successor who can compare with him. As a\nwriter he was always brilliant, lucid, and vigorous, and his unrivalled\n'Introductions' to the Calendars of Letters and Papers, concerned with\nthe reign of Henry VIII., will long continue to be read by all students\nof our History, as necessary and indispensable interpreters of the vast\nstorehouses of original documents which he did so much to rescue from\nthe oblivion or obscurity to which they had previously been consigned.\nBut it was as an organizer of research that Mr. Brewer earned his\ngreatest fame and achieved his greatest success, and it was to him more\nthan to any one man, to his immense persistence in urging upon the\npowers that be a more generous freedom of access to our Records, and to\nhis prodigious powers of work in arranging and tabulating the enormous\nmasses of documents of all kinds which constitute the _Apparatus_ of\nEnglish History, that this country stands indebted, and will remain\nindebted as long as our literature lasts.\n\nIn the Essay on 'New Sources of English History' the learned author has\ngiven us a startling account of the deplorable condition into which some\nof the most precious of our national manuscripts had been allowed to\nfall--of the utterly chaotic state of our depositories--of the\nhopelessness, the despair which must needs have come upon one student\nafter another who might be fortunate enough to be turned loose into the\nvarious prison-houses of our muniments--and of the efforts made, and\nhappily at last made with splendid success, to cleanse the Augean\nstable, and to let the world know something of the wealth it contained.\nWith characteristic modesty Mr. Brewer said nothing of his own part in\nall that laborious and sagacious organization which resulted in our\nobtaining the magnificent _Calendars_, which have opened out to us all\n'that new world which is the old' that had become almost forgotten or\nunknown. He was not the man to assert himself, he knew that posterity\nwould give him his due, but with a simple desire to stimulate research,\nand to show how much remained to be done, and how much to be discovered\nand made known, he drew the attention of his readers chiefly and\nprimarily to the value of the Calendars, and to the important results\nwhich those Calendars had already produced, and were destined to produce\nhereafter. He had quite enough to say upon this point, and if his life\nhad been spared, it is probable that he would eventually have given us a\nmore comprehensive account of the series of volumes which, though now\nissuing from the press _pari passu_ with the Calendars, were originally\nundertaken a little later. Such an Essay by such a master would indeed\nhave been an important aid to the student, but at the time of Mr.\nBrewer's lamented death the day had hardly come for such a _r\u00e9sum\u00e9_; and\neven now, though so much has been achieved, so much and so well, the\nhour has hardly arrived nor the man for taking a comprehensive survey,\nand giving to the public an intelligent and intelligible account of that\nother Library of Chronicles, and biographies, and letters, and\ncartularies, and those other memorials of the Middle Ages in England,\nwhich it is to be feared are hardly as well known as they ought to be,\nnor as widely studied as they deserve.\n\nMeanwhile it is high time that attention should be drawn to that noble\nseries of volumes now issuing from the press under the editorship of\nscholars whose reputation is assured, and whose work continues to\nenhance their reputation--high time that we should begin to do something\nlike justice to the labourers, who have deserved so well at the hands\nof such Englishmen as have any sentiment of loyalty to the great\nthoughts, the great doings, and the noble lives of their forefathers.\nThe philosopher, who 'holds the mirror up to nature,' has not of late,\nas a rule, missed his reward. The historian, who in his dogged, patient,\ntoilsome fashion holds the mirror up to the life of bygone ages, has\nreceived among us scant recognition, and generally is rewarded with but\nbarren honour. What has been done and still is doing will be best\nunderstood by briefly reviewing the progress of that movement, which has\nbrought about the great revival of English Historical study, and under\nthe influence of which the opinions and convictions of educated men have\npassed through a very decided change, one destined to produce still\ngreater and more unlooked for changes of sentiment and belief before the\npresent century shall have closed.\n\nIt is just fifty years since 'the Father of Record Reform,' as he has\nbeen justly called, received his patent creating him Master of the\nRolls. Although as far back as the year 1800 a Commission was issued for\nthe methodizing and digesting the National Records, and for printing\nsuch calendars and indexes as should be thought advisable; and though\nduring the next twenty-seven years many works of supreme interest and\nimportance were printed at the public expense, the enormous extent of\nour National Records were known to few, and the difficulty of consulting\nthem, (dispersed as they were through a score of different depositories)\nwas enough to deter all but the most resolute enquirers. It was Lord\nLangdale who first set himself to reduce the chaos of our archives into\nsomething like order. When the old Record Commission expired in 1837, it\nwas by Lord Langdale's influence that the Public Record Act was passed\non the 14th of August, 1838, whereby the Records named therein were\nplaced under the custody of the Master of the Rolls for the time being,\nand hereupon a new era began. Nevertheless it was not till July 1850\nthat a vote was obtained from the Treasury for the erection of a\nnational depository, wherein our vast archives should be assembled under\na single roof, and not till 1855 that the magnificent _Tabularium_ in\nFetter Lane was opened for the reception of our muniments.\n\nLord Langdale died in April 1851;[1] he was succeeded in the Mastership\nof the Rolls by Lord Romilly, then Sir John. A happier choice could not\nhave been made. To Lord Langdale belongs the credit of carrying out the\ngrand scheme for consolidating the various collections of documents,\nwhich, as we have said, had up to this time been widely dispersed, and\nthe very existence of the larger mass of which was known only to a few\nexperts. To Lord Romilly we owe it that the great original sources of\nEnglish History so assembled have been rendered accessible to any\nstudent who desires to consult them; and it is to him, too, that we are\nindebted for the issue of that unrivalled series of 'Chronicles and\nMemorials of Great Britain and Ireland, from the Invasion of the Romans\nto the Reign of Henry VIII.,' which has laid the foundation for a\nscience of history firmer and deeper and wider than before was believed\nto be even attainable.\n\nGreat men are at once the leaders and the product of their age. When\nLord Langdale set himself to his task he was only attempting that which\nhad been talked of since the reign of Edward II. For five centuries the\nunification of our National Records had been recommended and advised by\nlawyers, statesmen, and scholars from generation to generation, but no\npractical scheme had ever been suggested, and the difficulties in the\nway of reform were supposed to be insuperable. It was a Herculean task,\nand one that grew ever more arduous the longer it was postponed. During\nthe first quarter of the present century profound dissatisfaction had\nbegun to be felt at the condition of our historical literature. The\nordinary text-books were full of fables, more than suspected to be\nfables, and which yet it was extremely difficult to disprove\nsatisfactorily. Theories which had long passed current were being rudely\nassailed, and yet--in the face of the obstacles that hindered\nresearch--stubbornly held their ground, or were repeated with peremptory\ndogmatism. A deep distrust of the old methods and the old assumptions\nhad given rise to a widespread desire to drag forth from their\nhiding-places any documents, however dry or recondite, which might throw\nsome clear light upon our national life and manners, and not only upon\nmere events of national importance during Medieval times. A desire to\nknow the truth was _in the air_. The science of history had passed out\nof its infancy, and the stirrings of a new craving--the passion of\nResearch--were making themselves felt in that mysterious restlessness\nwhich indicates that the old smooth-faced docility, the old childish\nsubmission to tutelage, the old unquestioning acceptance of authority,\nhas gone for ever, and a new life has begun. The year before Lord\nLangdale received his appointment as Master of the Rolls, the Surtees\nSociety had been founded for the printing of unedited MSS. illustrative\nof the history of the northern counties; and in the same year that the\nold Record Commission expired, the English Historical Society was\nstarted, a society which numbered amongst its promoters such men as the\nlate Mr. Kemble, Mr. H. O. Coxe, Sir T. Duffus Hardy, and Mr.\nStevenson--the leaders and teachers of that school of younger men who\nhave so ably followed in the steps of their seniors, and who, mounting\non the shoulders of the giants, have gained a wider view than it was\ngiven to those others to attain. The five years that followed saw the\nfoundation of the Camden, the Percy, and the Chetham Societies, not to\nmention many another that has done useful work in its way. The labours\nof these pioneers soon made it quite apparent that the sources of our\nnational history--social, ecclesiastical, and political--were quite too\nvoluminous for private enterprise to deal with, and would demand the\nco-operation of a body of trained scholars and the resources of the\npublic exchequer to make them available as apparatus for the teachers of\nthe future.\n\nOn the 26th of January, 1857, Sir John Romilly submitted to the Treasury\nhis memorable proposal for the publication of certain materials for the\nHistory of England;[2] and on the 9th of February a Treasury Minute was\nput forth approving of the plan that had been drawn up as one 'well\ncalculated for the accomplishment of this important national object in\nan effectual and satisfactory manner within a reasonable time.'\nForthwith arrangements were made for the issue of that series of works\nwhich is now known as the 'Rolls Series,' a collection which has already\nextended to upwards of 200 volumes.\n\nThe lines laid down by Sir John Romilly were almost exactly those which\nhad been followed by the English Historical Society. Every editor was to\n'give an account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and their\npeculiarities;' he was to add 'a brief account of the life and times of\nthe author, and any remarks necessary to explain the chronology; _but no\nother note or comment_ was to be allowed, except what might be necessary\nto establish the correctness of the text.' The restriction was\nabsolutely necessary if only for this, that when the 'Rolls Series' was\nfirst commenced even the most accomplished of its editors were mere\nlearners. The time had not yet arrived for comments. The text was wanted\nfirst in its completeness and integrity.\n\nLooking back to this period--little more than a quarter of a century\nago--it is difficult for us to realize the deplorable condition into\nwhich our historical literature had been allowed to fall. Kemble's great\nwork, the 'Codex Diplomaticus \u00e6vi Saxonici,' the first volume of which\nappeared in 1839, and his 'History of the Saxons in England,' published\nin 1849, came upon the great body of intelligent men as the revelation\nof new things. It is sufficient to turn to the chapter on the\nConstitutional History of England before the Conquest, in Hallam's\n'History of the Middle Ages,' to be assured how meagre and superficial\neven Hallam's knowledge was of everything before the Norman invasion. It\nwas no fault of his; he made good use of all such materials as were then\naccessible to the student--that is, all such as had been printed; for\nthat incomparably larger _apparatus_ which since Hallam's days has been\npublished to the world, it was for all practical purposes as if it had\nnever existed at all. Even men of culture and learning were persuaded\nthat all that was ever likely to be known about the religious houses had\nbeen collected in the new edition of Dugdale's 'Monasticon.' It is\nhardly too much to say that of the history of English monasticism Hallam\nknew nothing. Dr. Lingard himself had very little more to say of the\ngreat Abbeys than his predecessors, and had a very inadequate conception\nof the part they played in the development of our institutions; and when\nDr. Maitland wrote his brilliant 'Essays on the Dark Ages,' he hardly\nnames St. Edmundsbury or St. Alban's, and though one of his most\nfascinating chapters is concerned with the early days of Croyland, his\nonly authority for the beautiful story, which he has handled so\nskilfully, is a romantic narrative attributed to Ingulphus, which has\nbeen demonstrated to be a somewhat clumsy though a clever forgery."}

Ultimately, the emperor was assassinated by a handful of his own guards.

Hither\nwe hasted, at nine o'clock in the morning, to take a view of the court, judges, and counsel,\nand congratulate our friend Gradus on his _entr\u00e9e_. It has been said, that the only profession\nin this country where talents can insure success, is the law. If by this is meant talents of\na popular kind, the power of giving effect to comprehensive views of justice and the bonds\nof society, a command of language, and a faculty of bringing to bear upon one point all the\nresources of intellect and knowledge, they are mistaken; they speak from former experience,\nand not from present observation: they are thinking of the days of a Mingay or an Erskine,\nnot of those of a Marryat or a Scarlett; of the time when juries were wrought upon by the united\ninfluence of zeal and talent, not when they are governed by _precedents and practice_; when\nmen were allowed to feel a little, as well as think a great deal; when the now common phrase\nof possessing the _ear of the court_ was not understood, and the tactician and the bully were\nunknown to the bar. It is asserted, that one-fifth of the causes that come before our courts\nare decided upon mere matters of form, without the slightest reference to their merits. Every\nstudent for the bar must now place himself under some special pleader, and go through all the\ncomplicated drudgery of the office of one of these underlings, before he can hope to fill a\nhigher walk; general principles, and enlarged notions of law and justice, are smothered in\nlaborious and absurd technicalities; the enervated mind becomes shackled, until the natural\nvigour of the intellect is so reduced, as to make its bondage cease to seem burdensome. Dick,\nwith a confidence in his own powers, has avoided this degrading preparation; it is only two\nmonths since he was first called to the bar, and with a knowledge of his father's influence\nand property added to his own talents, he hopes to make a ~357~~stand in court, previous to\nhis being transplanted to the Commons House of Parliament."}

{"ID": 429, "text": "Scenes like these he draws with sharp defined outlines.  When he had to describe what\nhe only knew by hearsay, his pictures are shadowy and cold. Never having been very far from\nhome, he had had no experience of the higher types of beauty and grandeur in nature, and his\npen moves in fetters when he attempts to describe them.  When his pilgrims come to the Hill\nDifficulty and the Delectable Mountains, the difference is at once seen.  All his nobler imagery\nis drawn from Scripture.  As Hallam has remarked, \"There is scarcely a circumstance or metaphor\nin the Old Testament which does not find a place bodily and literally in 'The Pilgrim's Progress,'\nand this has made his imagination appear more creative than it really is.\"\n\nIt would but weary the reader to follow the details of a narrative which is so universally\nknown.  Who needs to be told that in the pilgrimage here described is represented in allegorical\ndress the course of a human soul convinced of sin, struggling onwards to salvation through\nthe trials and temptations that beset its path to its eternal home?  The book is so completely\nwrought into the mind and memory, that most of us can at once recall the incidents which chequer\nthe pilgrim's way, and realize their meaning; the Slough of Despond, in which the man convinced\nof his guilt and fleeing from the wrath to come, in his agonizing self-consciousness is in\ndanger of being swallowed up in despair; the Wicket Gate, by which he enters on the strait\nand narrow way of holiness; the Interpreter's House, with his visions and acted parables; the\nWayside Cross, at the sight of which the burden of guilt falls from the pilgrim's back, and\nhe is clothed with change of raiment; the Hill Difficulty, which stands right in his way, and\nwhich he must surmount, not circumvent; the lions which he has to pass, not knowing that they\nare chained; the Palace Beautiful, where he is admitted to the communion of the faithful, and\nsits down to meat with them; the Valley of Humiliation, the scene of his desperate but victorious\nencounter with Apollyon; the Valley of the Shadow of Death, with its evil sights and doleful\nsounds, where one of the wicked ones whispers into his ear thoughts of blasphemy which he cannot\ndistinguish from the suggestions of his own mind; the cave at the valley's mouth, in which,\nGiant Pagan having been dead this many a day, his brother, Giant Pope, now sits alone, grinning\nat pilgrims as they pass by, and biting his nails because he cannot get at them; Vanity Fair,\nthe picture of the world, as St. John describes it, hating the light that puts to shame its\nown self-chosen darkness, and putting it out if it can, where the Pilgrim's fellow, Faithful,\nseals his testimony with his death, and the Pilgrim himself barely escapes; the \"delicate plain\"\ncalled Ease, and the little hill, Lucre, where Demas stood \"gentlemanlike,\" to invite the passersby\nto come and dig in his silver mine; Byepath Meadow, into which the Pilgrim and his newly-found\ncompanion stray, and are made prisoners by Giant Despair and shut up in the dungeons of Doubting\nCastle, and break out of prison by the help of the Key of Promise; the Delectable Mountains\nin Immanuel's Land, with their friendly shepherds and the cheering prospect of the far-off\nheavenly city; the Enchanted Land, with its temptations to spiritual drowsiness at the very\nend of the journey; the Land of Beulah, the ante-chamber of the city to which they were bound;\nand, last stage of all, the deep dark river, without a bridge, which had to be crossed before\nthe city was entered; the entrance into its heavenly gates, the pilgrim's joyous reception\nwith all the bells in the city ringing again for joy; the Dreamer's glimpse of its glories\nthrough the opened portals--is not every stage of the journey, every scene of the pilgrimage,\nindelibly printed on our memories, for our warning, our instruction, our encouragement in the\nrace we, as much as they, have each one to run?  Have we not all, again and again, shared the\nDreamer's feelings--\"After that they shut up the Gates; which, when I had seen, I wished myself\namong them,\" and prayed, God helping us, that our \"dangerous journey\"--ever the most dangerous\nwhen we see its dangers the least--might end in our \"safe arrival at the desired country\"?\n\n\"The Pilgrim's Progress\" exhibits Bunyan in the character by which he would have most desired\nto be remembered, as one of the most influential of Christian preachers.  Hallam, however,\nclaims for him another distinction which would have greatly startled and probably shocked him,\nas the father of our English novelists.  As an allegorist Bunyan had many predecessors, not\na few of whom, dating from early times, had taken the natural allegory of the pilgrimage of\nhuman life as the basis of their works.  But as a novelist he had no one to show him the way.\nBunyan was the first to break ground in a field which has since then been so overabundantly\nworked that the soil has almost lost its productiveness; while few novels written purely with\nthe object of entertainment have ever proved so universally entertaining.  Intensely religious\nas it is in purpose, \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" may be safely styled the first English novel.\n\"The claim to be the father of English romance,\" writes Dr. Allon, \"which has been sometimes\npreferred for Defoe, really pertains to Bunyan.  Defoe may claim the parentage of a species,\nbut Bunyan is the creator of the genus.\"  As the parent of fictitious biography it is that\nBunyan has charmed the world.  On its vivid interest as a story, its universal interest and\nlasting vitality rest.  \"Other allegorises,\" writes Lord Macaulay, \"have shown great ingenuity,\nbut no other allegorist has ever been able to touch the heart, and to make its abstractions\nobjects of terror, of pity, and of love.\"  Whatever its deficiencies, literary and religious,\nmay be; if we find incongruities in the narrative, and are not insensible to some grave theological\ndeficiencies; if we are unable without qualification to accept Coleridge's dictum that it is\n\"incomparably the best 'Summa Theologiae Evangelicae' ever produced by a writer not miraculously\ninspired;\" even if, with Hallam, we consider its \"excellencies great indeed, but not of the\nhighest order,\" and deem it \"a little over-praised,\" the fact of its universal popularity with\nreaders of all classes and of all orders of intellect remains, and gives this book a unique\ndistinction.  \"I have,\" says Dr. Arnold, when reading it after a long interval, \"always been\nstruck by its piety.  I am now struck equally or even more by its profound wisdom.  It seems\nto be a complete reflexion of Scripture.\"  And to turn to a critic of very different character,\nDean Swift: \"I have been better entertained and more improved,\" writes that cynical pessimist,\n\"by a few pages of this book than by a long discourse on the will and intellect.\"  The favourite\nof our childhood, as \"the most perfect and complex of fairy tales, so human and intelligible,\"\nread, as Hallam says, \"at an age when the spiritual meaning is either little perceived or little\nregarded,\" the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" becomes the chosen companion of our later years, perused\nwith ever fresh appreciation of its teaching, and enjoyment of its native genius; \"the interpreter\nof life to all who are perplexed with its problems, and the practical guide and solace of all\nwho need counsel and sympathy.\"\n\nThe secret of this universal acceptableness of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" lies in the breadth\nof its religious sympathies.  Rigid Puritan as Bunyan was, no book is more completely free\nfrom sectarian narrowness.  Its reach is as wide as Christianity itself, and it takes hold\nof every human heart because it is so intensely human.  No apology is needed for presenting\nMr. Froude's eloquent panegyric: \"The Pilgrim, though in Puritan dress, is a genuine man. \nHis experience is so truly human experience that Christians of every persuasion can identify\nthemselves with him; and even those who regard Christianity itself as but a natural outgrowth\nof the conscience and intellect, and yet desire to live nobly and make the best of themselves,\ncan recognize familiar footprints in every step of Christian's journey.  Thus 'The Pilgrim's\nProgress' is a book which when once read can never be forgotten.  We too, every one of us,\nare pilgrims on the same road; and images and illustrations come back to us from so faithful\nan itinerary, as we encounter similar trials, and learn for ourselves the accuracy with which\nBunyan has described them. Time cannot impair its interest, or intellectual progress make it\ncease to be true to experience.\"  Dr. Brown's appreciative words may be added: \"With deepest\npathos it enters into the stern battle so real to all of us, into those heart-experiences which\nmake up, for all, the discipline of life.  It is this especially which has given to it the\nmighty hold which it has always had upon the toiling poor, and made it the one book above all\nbooks well-thumbed and torn to tatters among them.  And it is this which makes it one of the\nfirst books translated by the missionary who seeks to give true thoughts of God and life to\nheathen men.\"\n\nThe Second Part of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" partakes of the character of almost all continuations.\nIt is, in Mr. Froude's words, \"only a feeble reverberation of the first part, which has given\nit a popularity it would have hardly attained by its own merits.  Christiana and her children\nare tolerated for the pilgrim's sake to whom they belong.\"  Bunyan seems not to have been insensible\nof this himself, when in his metrical preface he thus introduces his new work:\n\n   \"Go now my little book to every place\n   Where my first Pilgrim has but shown his face.\n   Call at their door; if any say 'Who's there?'\n   Then answer thus, 'Christiana is here.'\n   If they bid thee come in, then enter thou\n   With all thy boys.  And then, as thou know'st how,\n   Tell who they are, also from whence they came;\n   Perhaps they'll know them by their looks or name.\"\n\nBut although the Second Part must be pronounced inferior, on the whole, to the first, it is\na work of striking individuality and graphic power, such as Bunyan alone could have written.\nEverywhere we find strokes of his peculiar genius, and though in a smaller measure than the\nfirst, it has added not a few portraits to Bunyan's spiritual picture gallery we should be\nsorry to miss, and supplied us with racy sayings which stick to the memory.  The sweet maid\nMercy affords a lovely picture of gentle feminine piety, well contrasted with the more vigorous\nbut still thoroughly womanly character of Christiana.  Great-Heart is too much of an abstraction:\na preacher in the uncongenial disguise of a knightly champion of distressed females and the\nslayer of giants.  But the other new characters have generally a vivid personality.  Who can\nforget Old Honesty, the dull good man with no mental gifts but of dogged sincerity, who though\ncoming from the Town of Stupidity, four degrees beyond the City of Destruction, was \"known\nfor a cock of the right kind,\" because he said the truth and stuck to it; or his companion,\nMr. Fearing, that most troublesome of pilgrims, stumbling at every straw, lying roaring at\nthe Slough of Despond above a month together, standing shaking and shrinking at the Wicket\nGate, but making no stick at the Lions, and at last getting over the river not much above wetshod;\nor Mr. Valiant for Truth, the native of Darkland, standing with his sword drawn and his face\nall bloody from his three hours' fight with Wildhead, Inconsiderate, and Pragmatick; Mr. Standfast,\nblushing to be found on his knees in the Enchanted Ground, one who loved to hear his Lord spoken\nof, and coveted to set his foot wherever he saw the print of his shoe; Mr. Feeblemind, the\nsickly, melancholy pilgrim, at whose door death did usually knock once a day, betaking himself\nto a pilgrim's life because he was never well at home, resolved to run when he could, and go\nwhen he could not run, and creep when he could not go, an enemy to laughter and to gay attire,\nbringing up the rear of the company with Mr. Readytohalt hobbling along on his crutches; Giant\nDespair's prisoners, Mr. Despondency, whom he had all but starved to death--and Mistress Much-afraid\nhis daughter, who went through the river singing, though none could understand what she said?\nEach of these characters has a distinct individuality which lifts them from shadowy abstractions\ninto living men and women.  But with all its excellencies, and they are many, the general inferiority\nof the history of Christiana and her children's pilgrimage to that of her husband's must be\nacknowledged.  The story is less skilfully constructed; the interest is sometimes allowed to\nflag; the dialogues that interrupt the narrative are in places dry and wearisome--too much\nof sermons in disguise.  There is also a want of keeping between the two parts of the allegory.\nThe Wicket Gate of the First Part has become a considerable building with a summer parlour\nin the Second; the shepherds' tents on the Delectable Mountains have risen into a palace, with\na dining-room, and a looking- glass, and a store of jewels; while Vanity Fair has lost its\nformer bad character, and has become a respectable country town, where Christiana and her family,\nseeming altogether to forget their pilgrimage, settled down comfortably, enjoy the society\nof the good people of the place, and the sons marry and have children.  These same children\nalso cause the reader no little perplexity, when he finds them in the course of the supposed\njourney transformed from sweet babes who are terrified with the Mastiffs barking at the Wicket\nGate, who catch at the boughs for the unripe plums and cry at having to climb the hill; whose\nfaces are stroked by the Interpreter; who are catechised and called \"good boys\" by Prudence;\nwho sup on bread crumbled into basins of milk, and are put to bed by Mercy--into strong young\nmen, able to go out and fight with a giant, and lend a hand to the pulling down of Doubting\nCastle, and becoming husbands and fathers.  We cannot but feel the want of _vraisemblance_\nwhich brings the whole company of pilgrims to the banks of the dark river at one time, and\nsends them over in succession, following one another rapidly through the Golden Gate of the\nCity.  The four boys with their wives and children, it is true, stay behind awhile, but there\nis an evident incongruity in their doing so when the allegory has brought them all to what\nstands for the close of their earthly pilgrimage.  Bunyan's mistake was in gratifying his inventive\ngenius and making his band of pilgrims so large.  He could get them together and make them\ntravel in company without any sacrifice of dramatic truth, which, however, he was forced to\ndisregard when the time came for their dismissal.  The exquisite pathos of the description\nof the passage of the river by Christian and Hopeful blinds us to what may be almost termed\nthe impossibility of two persons passing through the final struggle together, and dying at\nthe same moment, but this charm is wanting in the prosaic picture of the company of fellow-travellers\ncoming down to the water's edge, and waiting till the postman blows his horn and bids them\ncross. Much as the Second Part contains of what is admirable, and what no one but Bunyan could\nhave written, we feel after reading it that, in Mr. Froude's words, the rough simplicity is\ngone, and has been replaced by a tone of sentiment which is almost mawkish.  \"Giants, dragons,\nand angelic champions carry us into a spurious fairyland where the knight-errant is a preacher\nin disguise.  Fair ladies and love-matches, however decorously chastened, suit ill with the\nsternness of the mortal conflict between the soul and sin.\"  With the acknowledged shortcomings\nof the Second Part of \"The Pilgrim's Progress,\" we may be well content that Bunyan never carried\nout the idea hinted at in the closing words of his allegory: \"Shall it be my lot to go that\nway again, I may give those that desire it an account of what I am here silent about; in the\nmeantime I bid my reader--Adieu.\"\n\nBunyan's second great allegorical work, \"The Holy War,\" need not detain us long.  Being an\nattempt, and in the nature of things an unsuccessful attempt, to clothe what writers on divinity\ncall \"the plan of salvation\" in a figurative dress, the narrative, with all its vividness of\ndescription in parts, its clearly drawn characters with their picturesque nomenclature, and\nthe stirring vicissitudes of the drama, is necessarily wanting in the personal interest which\nattaches to an individual man, like Christian, and those who are linked with or follow his\ncareer.  In fact, the tremendous realities of the spiritual history of the human race are entirely\nunfit for allegorical treatment as a whole.  Sin, its origin, its consequences, its remedy,\nand the apparent failure of that remedy though administered by Almighty hands, must remain\na mystery for all time.  The attempts made by Bunyan, and by one of much higher intellectual\npower and greater poetic gifts than Bunyan--John Milton--to bring that mystery within the grasp\nof the finite intellect, only render it more perplexing.  The proverbial line tells us that--\n\n   \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"\n\nBunyan and Milton were as far as possible from being \"fools\"; but when both these great writers,\non the one hand, carry us up into the Council Chamber of Heaven and introduce us to the Persons\nof the ever-blessed Trinity, debating, consulting, planning, and resolving, like a sovereign\nand his ministers when a revolted province has to be brought back to its allegiance; and, on\nthe other hand, take us down to the infernal regions, and makes us privy to the plots and counterplots\nof the rebel leaders and hearers of their speeches, we cannot but feel that, in spite of the\nmagnificent diction and poetic imagination of the one, and the homely picturesque genius of\nthe other, the grand themes treated of are degraded if not vulgarized, without our being in\nany way helped to unravel their essential mysteries.  In point of individual personal interest,\n\"The Holy War\" contrasts badly with \"The Pilgrim's Progress.\"  The narrative moves in a more\nshadowy region.  We may admire the workmanship; but the same undefined sense of unreality pursues\nus through Milton's noble epic, the outcome of a divinely-fired genius, and Bunyan's humble\nnarrative, drawing its scenes and circumstances, and to some extent its _dramatis personae_,\nfrom the writer's own surroundings in the town and corporation of Bedford, and his brief but\nstirring experience as a soldier in the great Parliamentary War.  The catastrophe also is eminently\nunsatisfactory.  When Christian and Hopeful enter the Golden Gates we feel that the story has\ncome to its proper end, which we have been looking for all along.  But the conclusion of \"The\nHoly War\" is too much like the closing chapter of \"Rasselas\"--\"a conclusion in which nothing\nis concluded.\"  After all the endless vicissitudes of the conflict, and the final and glorious\nvictory of Emmanuel and his forces, and the execution of the ringleaders of the mutiny, the\nissue still remains doubtful."}

{"ID": 156, "text": "The evening of that day was unforgettable as a significant number of individuals gathered, including multiple pastors and young people. J.Y. couldn't recall a more solemn occasion. The presence of the Savior felt close, providing comfort and teachings. After M.Y. and J.Y. shared their thoughts through testimony and supplication, the professor and other pastors spoke with strong emotion, seemingly influenced by the Spirit. They left with a strong conviction that those who rely on their blessed Redeemer in living faith will experience support and consolation. \n\nIn Berne, they reconnected with old friends they had ministered to previously. They regularly joined together for worship and religious conversation. One evening, the host expressed her belief that many devoted individuals are being led by the Lord to listen to His voice for consolation. This was a significant change as she had previously held strong views on election and the finished work of grace. J.Y. noted that some expressed a desire for a more spiritual focus, enjoying waiting on the Lord in silence. \n\nUpon arrival in Basle, they were welcomed by Hoffmann, who had taken over the Mission House. They attended a religious meeting with students and spent time with a pious family where various missionaries and pastors were present. The occasion led them to reflect on the importance of uniting in desire for a more general outpouring of the Spirit, and how allowing divine influence to thoroughly baptize the heart can reduce creaturely activity and enhance the purity of the gospel. \n\nThey visited with some individuals they knew from before but noted a visionary spirit among sincere people not of their profession. They recommended simplicity and a focus on Scripture and the Shepherd's voice. J.Y. also visited an establishment called the Pilgrim Mission Institution and met three young men from Syria who sought refuge from the war in their country, desiring to become capable of instructing their countrymen. They later entered Germany and struggled with the language barrier. One notable visit was with the Princess of W\u00fcrtemberg, where they had a satisfying conversation and offered prayers and exhortation for her family, emphasizing divine blessing on all branches.As they said their goodbyes, the princess expressed her gratitude for their visit, viewing it as a divine blessing. The following day they resumed their journey to Pyrmont, but grew weary and rested in Frankfort for two days. There, they reconnected with old friends and spent time with Dr. Pinkerton, observing his Christian humility and charity. In Pyrmont, they attended a Two months' Meeting at Minden where many peasants also participated. Some of these peasants later asked John and Martha to meet a group of their brethren in Vlotho. Though John had a fall on their way, they continued to Lemgo, and eventually reached Vlotho for a remarkable meeting. They eventually returned home to England, stopping at D\u00fcsseldorf to visit Count Von der Recke's now physically worn and ill person. Upon returning to England, they stayed in Hertford, Oxford, and Buckinghamshire, attending meetings and visiting several times. They soon began a search for a new home and purchased Gossom Lodge in Berkhamstead. They also made the decision to move even closer to London, contemplating a move in the immediate vicinity.During a period of contemplation, John Yeardley recorded in his Diary that he and his wife felt a strong sense of duty to relocate to Stoke Newington Meeting. In 1845, they made the decision to move to Stamford Hill, believing that their prayer had been answered and their deliberations guided by divine wisdom. The transition was smooth, with their house in Berkhamstead quickly being let and a new dwelling found in Stamford Hill. However, John Yeardley\u2019s health deteriorated with jaundice soon after settling in, leading to a journey to Bath and Harrowgate for medical treatment. They also began visiting Quaker meetings in London and surrounding areas, fulfilling a service they had always intended to undertake. From November 1846 to January 1847, they conducted a religious visit to the families of members and attenders of Gracechurch street Monthly Meeting. Despite the realization of their own inability to help others without divine assistance, their reception by others was cordial and kind. They returned to their home in Stamford Hill, just one day after the sudden death of Joseph John Gurney, and were also affected by the loss of a Scarborough friend. In 1848, John Yeardley readied himself to travel across Europe to preach the Gospel.John Yeardley embarked on a mission with his beloved wife, who joined him as a fellow laborer in gospel service and as his companion and helper in countries where she was not called to labor. Their journey was planned to South Russia, the German colonies, Prussian and Austrian dominions, parts of Switzerland and France, Ard\u00eache, and a few places in Belgium. The couple received the full unity of their friends and expressed gratitude for their sympathy and encouragement. However, due to the storm that was brewing in France and the convulsed state of European nations, the Yeardleys had to wait for a few months before their journey began. In a Quarterly Meeting with ministers and elders, the couple obtained further concurrence and certificates that expressed sympathy and encouragement. Despite the challenges posed by the state of affairs in Europe at that time, John Yeardley felt a confiding hope in divine power for protection and safe guidance. Though this series of travels was the last time the pair embarked on such an undertaking as joint laborers in the Lord's work, the memories of John Yeardley's resolute spirit and passionate devotion to the gospel remain vivid in the minds of those who knew him in middle life."}

{"ID": 1492, "text": "We were soon there, and housed in the hotel. But the waning day had such an\ninviting influence that we did not remain housed many moments, but struck out and followed\na roaring torrent of ice-water up to its far source in a sort of little grass-carpeted parlor,\nwalled in all around by vast precipices and overlooked by clustering summits of ice. This was\nthe snuggest little croquet-ground imaginable; it was perfectly level, and not more than a\nmile long by half a mile wide. The walls around it were so gigantic, and everything about it\nwas on so mighty a scale that it was belittled, by contrast, to what I have likened it to--a\ncozy and carpeted parlor. It was so high above the Kandersteg valley that there was nothing\nbetween it and the snowy-peaks. I had never been in such intimate relations with the high altitudes\nbefore; the snow-peaks had always been remote and unapproachable grandeurs, hitherto, but now\nwe were hob-a-nob--if one may use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations so\naugust as these.\n\nWe could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing from under the greenish\nramparts of glaciers; but two or three of these, instead of flowing over the precipices, sank\ndown into the rock and sprang in big jets out of holes in the mid-face of the walls.\n\nThe green nook which I have been describing is called the Gasternthal. The glacier streams\ngather and flow through it in a broad and rushing brook to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices;\nhere the rushing brook becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down toward Kandersteg,\nlashing and thrashing its way over and among monster boulders, and hurling chance roots and\nlogs about like straws. There was no lack of cascades along this route. The path by the side\nof the torrent was so narrow that one had to look sharp, when he heard a cow-bell, and hunt\nfor a place that was wide enough to accommodate a cow and a Christian side by side, and such\nplaces were not always to be had at an instant's notice. The cows wear church-bells, and that\nis a good idea in the cows, for where that torrent is, you couldn't hear an ordinary cow-bell\nany further than you could hear the ticking of a watch.\n\nI needed exercise, so I employed my agent in setting stranded logs and dead trees adrift, and\nI sat on a boulder and watched them go whirling and leaping head over heels down the boiling\ntorrent. It was a wonderfully exhilarating spectacle. When I had had enough exercise, I made\nthe agent take some, by running a race with one of those logs. I made a trifle by betting on\nthe log.\n\nAfter dinner we had a walk up and down the Kandersteg valley, in the soft gloaming, with the\nspectacle of the dying lights of day playing about the crests and pinnacles of the still and\nsolemn upper realm for contrast, and text for talk. There were no sounds but the dulled complaining\nof the torrent and the occasional tinkling of a distant bell. The spirit of the place was a\nsense of deep, pervading peace; one might dream his life tranquilly away there, and not miss\nit or mind it when it was gone.\n\nThe summer departed with the sun, and winter came with the stars. It grew to be a bitter night\nin that little hotel, backed up against a precipice that had no visible top to it, but we kept\nwarm, and woke in time in the morning to find that everybody else had left for Gemmi three\nhours before--so our little plan of helping that German family (principally the old man) over\nthe pass, was a blocked generosity.\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV [The World's Highest Pig Farm]\n\nWe hired the only guide left, to lead us on our way. He was over seventy, but he could have\ngiven me nine-tenths of his strength and still had all his age entitled him to. He shouldered\nour satchels, overcoats, and alpenstocks, and we set out up the steep path. It was hot work.\nThe old man soon begged us to hand over our coats and waistcoats to him to carry, too, and\nwe did it; one could not refuse so little a thing to a poor old man like that; he should have\nhad them if he had been a hundred and fifty.\n\nWhen we began that ascent, we could see a microscopic chalet perched away up against heaven\non what seemed to be the highest mountain near us. It was on our right, across the narrow head\nof the valley. But when we got up abreast it on its own level, mountains were towering high\nabove on every hand, and we saw that its altitude was just about that of the little Gasternthal\nwhich we had visited the evening before. Still it seemed a long way up in the air, in that\nwaste and lonely wilderness of rocks. It had an unfenced grass-plot in front of it which seemed\nabout as big as a billiard-table, and this grass-plot slanted so sharply downward, and was\nso brief, and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge of the absolute precipice, that it was\na shuddery thing to think of a person's venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated\nat all. Suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard; there would be nothing for him\nto seize; nothing could keep him from rolling; five revolutions would bring him to the edge,\nand over he would go. What a frightful distance he would fall!--for there are very few birds\nthat fly as high as his starting-point. He would strike and bounce, two or three times, on\nhis way down, but this would be no advantage to him. I would as soon taking an airing on the\nslant of a rainbow as in such a front yard. I would rather, in fact, for the distance down\nwould be about the same, and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce. I could not see how\nthe peasants got up to that chalet--the region seemed too steep for anything but a balloon.\n\nAs we strolled on, climbing up higher and higher, we were continually bringing neighboring\npeaks into view and lofty prominence which had been hidden behind lower peaks before; so by\nand by, while standing before a group of these giants, we looked around for the chalet again;\nthere it was, away down below us, apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the valley! It was\nas far below us, now, as it had been above us when we were beginning the ascent.\n\nAfter a while the path led us along a railed precipice, and we looked over--far beneath us\nwas the snug parlor again, the little Gasternthal, with its water jets spouting from the face\nof its rock walls. We could have dropped a stone into it. We had been finding the top of the\nworld all along--and always finding a still higher top stealing into view in a disappointing\nway just ahead; when we looked down into the Gasternthal we felt pretty sure that we had reached\nthe genuine top at last, but it was not so; there were much higher altitudes to be scaled yet.\nWe were still in the pleasant shade of forest trees, we were still in a region which was cushioned\nwith beautiful mosses and aglow with the many-tinted luster of innumerable wild flowers.\n\nWe found, indeed, more interest in the wild flowers than in anything else. We gathered a specimen\nor two of every kind which we were unacquainted with; so we had sumptuous bouquets. But one\nof the chief interests lay in chasing the seasons of the year up the mountain, and determining\nthem by the presence of flowers and berries which we were acquainted with. For instance, it\nwas the end of August at the level of the sea; in the Kandersteg valley at the base of the\npass, we found flowers which would not be due at the sea-level for two or three weeks; higher\nup, we entered October, and gathered fringed gentians. I made no notes, and have forgotten\nthe details, but the construction of the floral calendar was very entertaining while it lasted.\n\nIn the high regions we found rich store of the splendid red flower called the Alpine rose,\nbut we did not find any examples of the ugly Swiss favorite called Edelweiss. Its name seems\nto indicate that it is a noble flower and that it is white. It may be noble enough, but it\nis not attractive, and it is not white. The fuzzy blossom is the color of bad cigar ashes,\nand appears to be made of a cheap quality of gray plush. It has a noble and distant way of\nconfining itself to the high altitudes, but that is probably on account of its looks; it apparently\nhas no monopoly of those upper altitudes, however, for they are sometimes intruded upon by\nsome of the loveliest of the valley families of wild flowers. Everybody in the Alps wears a\nsprig of Edelweiss in his hat. It is the native's pet, and also the tourist's.\n\nAll the morning, as we loafed along, having a good time, other pedestrians went staving by\nus with vigorous strides, and with the intent and determined look of men who were walking for\na wager. These wore loose knee-breeches, long yarn stockings, and hobnailed high-laced walking-shoes.\nThey were gentlemen who would go home to England or Germany and tell how many miles they had\nbeaten the guide-book every day. But I doubted if they ever had much real fun, outside of the\nmere magnificent exhilaration of the tramp through the green valleys and the breezy heights;\nfor they were almost always alone, and even the finest scenery loses incalculably when there\nis no one to enjoy it with.\n\nAll the morning an endless double procession of mule-mounted tourists filed past us along the\nnarrow path--the one procession going, the other coming. We had taken a good deal of trouble\nto teach ourselves the kindly German custom of saluting all strangers with doffed hat, and\nwe resolutely clung to it, that morning, although it kept us bareheaded most of the time and\nwas not always responded to. Still we found an interest in the thing, because we naturally\nliked to know who were English and Americans among the passers-by. All continental natives\nresponded of course; so did some of the English and Americans, but, as a general thing, these\ntwo races gave no sign. Whenever a man or a woman showed us cold neglect, we spoke up confidently\nin our own tongue and asked for such information as we happened to need, and we always got\na reply in the same language. The English and American folk are not less kindly than other\nraces, they are only more reserved, and that comes of habit and education. In one dreary, rocky\nwaste, away above the line of vegetation, we met a procession of twenty-five mounted young\nmen, all from America. We got answering bows enough from these, of course, for they were of\nan age to learn to do in Rome as Rome does, without much effort.\n\nAt one extremity of this patch of desolation, overhung by bare and forbidding crags which husbanded\ndrifts of everlasting snow in their shaded cavities, was a small stretch of thin and discouraged\ngrass, and a man and a family of pigs were actually living here in some shanties. Consequently\nthis place could be really reckoned as \"property\"; it had a money value, and was doubtless\ntaxed. I think it must have marked the limit of real estate in this world. It would be hard\nto set a money value upon any piece of earth that lies between that spot and the empty realm\nof space. That man may claim the distinction of owning the end of the world, for if there is\nany definite end to the world he has certainly found it.\n\nFrom here forward we moved through a storm-swept and smileless desolation. All about us rose\ngigantic masses, crags, and ramparts of bare and dreary rock, with not a vestige or semblance\nof plant or tree or flower anywhere, or glimpse of any creature that had life. The frost and\nthe tempests of unnumbered ages had battered and hacked at these cliffs, with a deathless energy,\ndestroying them piecemeal; so all the region about their bases was a tumbled chaos of great\nfragments which had been split off and hurled to the ground. Soiled and aged banks of snow\nlay close about our path. The ghastly desolation of the place was as tremendously complete\nas if Dor'e had furnished the working-plans for it. But every now and then, through the stern\ngateways around us we caught a view of some neighboring majestic dome, sheathed with glittering\nice, and displaying its white purity at an elevation compared to which ours was groveling and\nplebeian, and this spectacle always chained one's interest and admiration at once, and made\nhim forget there was anything ugly in the world.\n\nI have just said that there was nothing but death and desolation in these hideous places, but\nI forgot. In the most forlorn and arid and dismal one of all, where the racked and splintered\ndebris was thickest, where the ancient patches of snow lay against the very path, where the\nwinds blew bitterest and the general aspect was mournfulest and dreariest, and furthest from\nany suggestion of cheer or hope, I found a solitary wee forget-me-not flourishing away, not\na droop about it anywhere, but holding its bright blue star up with the prettiest and gallantest\nair in the world, the only happy spirit, the only smiling thing, in all that grisly desert.\nShe seemed to say, \"Cheer up!--as long as we are here, let us make the best of it.\" I judged\nshe had earned a right to a more hospitable place; so I plucked her up and sent her to America\nto a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made, all by her small self, to make\na whole vast despondent Alpine desolation stop breaking its heart over the unalterable, and\nhold up its head and look at the bright side of things for once.\n\nWe stopped for a nooning at a strongly built little inn called the Schwarenbach. It sits in\na lonely spot among the peaks, where it is swept by the trailing fringes of the cloud-rack,\nand is rained on, and snowed on, and pelted and persecuted by the storms, nearly every day\nof its life. It was the only habitation in the whole Gemmi Pass.\n\nClose at hand, now, was a chance for a blood-curdling Alpine adventure. Close at hand was the\nsnowy mass of the Great Altels cooling its topknot in the sky and daring us to an ascent. I\nwas fired with the idea, and immediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides, ropes,\netc., and undertake it. I instructed Harris to go to the landlord of the inn and set him about\nour preparations. Meantime, I went diligently to work to read up and find out what this much-talked-of\nmountain-climbing was like, and how one should go about it--for in these matters I was ignorant.\nI opened Mr. Hinchliff's SUMMER MONTHS AMONG THE ALPS (published 1857), and selected his account\nof his ascent of Monte Rosa.\n\nIt began:\n\n    \"It is very difficult to free the mind from excitement\n    on the evening before a grand expedition--\"\n\nI saw that I was too calm; so I walked the room a while and worked myself into a high excitement;\nbut the book's next remark--that the adventurer must get up at two in the morning--came as\nnear as anything to flatting it all out again. However, I reinforced it, and read on, about\nhow Mr. Hinchliff dressed by candle-light and was \"soon down among the guides, who were bustling\nabout in the passage, packing provisions, and making every preparation for the start\"; and\nhow he glanced out into the cold clear night and saw that--\n\n\"The whole sky was blazing with stars, larger and brighter than they appear through the dense\natmosphere breathed by inhabitants of the lower parts of the earth. They seemed actually suspended\nfrom the dark vault of heaven, and their gentle light shed a fairylike gleam over the snow-fields\naround the foot of the Matterhorn, which raised its stupendous pinnacle on high, penetrating\nto the heart of the Great Bear, and crowning itself with a diadem of his magnificent stars.\nNot a sound disturbed the deep tranquillity of the night, except the distant roar of streams\nwhich rush from the high plateau of the St. Theodule glacier, and fall headlong over precipitous\nrocks till they lose themselves in the mazes of the Gorner glacier.\"\n\nHe took his hot toast and coffee, and then about half past three his caravan of ten men filed\naway from the Riffel Hotel, and began the steep climb. At half past five he happened to turn\naround, and \"beheld the glorious spectacle of the Matterhorn, just touched by the rosy-fingered\nmorning, and looking like a huge pyramid of fire rising out of the barren ocean of ice and\nrock around it.\" Then the Breithorn and the Dent Blanche caught the radiant glow; but \"the\nintervening mass of Monte Rosa made it necessary for us to climb many long hours before we\ncould hope to see the sun himself, yet the whole air soon grew warmer after the splendid birth\nof the day.\"\n\nHe gazed at the lofty crown of Monte Rosa and the wastes of snow that guarded its steep approaches,\nand the chief guide delivered the opinion that no man could conquer their awful heights and\nput his foot upon that summit. But the adventurers moved steadily on, nevertheless.\n\nThey toiled up, and up, and still up; they passed the Grand Plateau; then toiled up a steep\nshoulder of the mountain, clinging like flies to its rugged face; and now they were confronted\nby a tremendous wall from which great blocks of ice and snow were evidently in the habit of\nfalling. They turned aside to skirt this wall, and gradually ascended until their way was barred\nby a \"maze of gigantic snow crevices,\"--so they turned aside again, and \"began a long climb\nof sufficient steepness to make a zigzag course necessary.\"\n\nFatigue compelled them to halt frequently, for a moment or two. At one of these halts somebody\ncalled out, \"Look at Mont Blanc!\" and \"we were at once made aware of the very great height\nwe had attained by actually seeing the monarch of the Alps and his attendant satellites right\nover the top of the Breithorn, itself at least 14,000 feet high!\"\n\nThese people moved in single file, and were all tied to a strong rope, at regular distances\napart, so that if one of them slipped on those giddy heights, the others could brace themselves\non their alpenstocks and save him from darting into the valley, thousands of feet below. By\nand by they came to an ice-coated ridge which was tilted up at a sharp angle, and had a precipice\non one side of it. They had to climb this, so the guide in the lead cut steps in the ice with\nhis hatchet, and as fast as he took his toes out of one of these slight holes, the toes of\nthe man behind him occupied it.\n\n\"Slowly and steadily we kept on our way over this dangerous part of the ascent, and I dare\nsay it was fortunate for some of us that attention was distracted from the head by the paramount\nnecessity of looking after the feet; FOR, WHILE ON THE LEFT THE INCLINE OF ICE WAS SO STEEP\nTHAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY MAN TO SAVE HIMSELF IN CASE OF A SLIP, UNLESS THE OTHERS\nCOULD HOLD HIM UP, ON THE RIGHT WE MIGHT DROP A PEBBLE FROM THE HAND OVER PRECIPICES OF UNKNOWN\nEXTENT DOWN UPON THE TREMENDOUS GLACIER BELOW.\n\n\"Great caution, therefore, was absolutely necessary, and in this exposed situation we were\nattacked by all the fury of that grand enemy of aspirants to Monte Rosa--a severe and bitterly\ncold wind from the north. The fine powdery snow was driven past us in the clouds, penetrating\nthe interstices of our clothes, and the pieces of ice which flew from the blows of Peter's\nax were whisked into the air, and then dashed over the precipice. We had quite enough to do\nto prevent ourselves from being served in the same ruthless fashion, and now and then, in the\nmore violent gusts of wind, were glad to stick our alpenstocks into the ice and hold on hard.\"\n\nHaving surmounted this perilous steep, they sat down and took a brief rest with their backs\nagainst a sheltering rock and their heels dangling over a bottomless abyss; then they climbed\nto the base of another ridge--a more difficult and dangerous one still:\n\n\"The whole of the ridge was exceedingly narrow, and the fall on each side desperately steep,\nbut the ice in some of these intervals between the masses of rock assumed the form of a mere\nsharp edge, almost like a knife; these places, though not more than three or four short paces\nin length, looked uncommonly awkward; but, like the sword leading true believers to the gates\nof Paradise, they must needs be passed before we could attain to the summit of our ambition."}

{"ID": 674, "text": "\"Did they look in that car?\"\n\n\"Yes. They had a warrant, or something, so they had a right to go\neverywhere on the train--and they did!\"\n\n\"I should think the people who didn't have anything to do with us must\nhave been furious.\"\n\n\"Oh, they were, but it didn't do them any good. They searched through\nthe whole train, but Zara looked so different in boy's clothes that they\nnever even seemed to suspect her at all. She kept perfectly still, you\nsee, and after they had held us up for nearly an hour, we came on.\"\n\n\"Oh, how mad they must have been!\"\n\n\"You ought to have seen them! It made us very late getting here, of\ncourse, and we missed the train we were to take to Green Cove. But I\nthink we would have waited here, anyhow, until you came. I was very\nanxious about you, Bessie. What a clever trick that was! If it hadn't\nbeen for you, we would have been caught without a chance to do anything\nat all.\"\n\n\"Bessie's made friends with Jake Hoover, too,\" said Dolly, disgustedly.\n\"Tell Miss Eleanor about that, Bessie.\"\n\n\"You did exactly the right thing,\" said Eleanor, when she had heard the\nstory, much to Dolly's disgust. \"I agree with Dolly that we will have to\nlook out for him, just the same, but there is a chance that he may do\nwhat he promised. Anyhow, there's a lot to gain and very little to\nlose.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nPLUM BEACH\n\n\nOn the way to Plum Beach, on the little branch line that carried the\ngirls from Bay City to Green Cove, Eleanor was very thoughtful, and\nBessie and Dolly were kept busy in telling the other girls of their\nexperiences. They wanted to hear from Zara, too, just how she had\nescaped.\n\n\"I don't see how you kept your face straight,\" said Dolly. \"I know I\nwould have burst right out laughing, Zara.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't think so if you knew Farmer Weeks,\" said Zara, making a\nwry face. \"I can tell you I didn't want to laugh, Dolly. Why, he was\nwithin a few feet of me, and looking straight at me! I was sure he'd\nguess that it was I.\"\n\n\"He always looks at everyone that way--just as if they owed him money,\"\nsaid Bessie. \"Nasty old man! I don't blame you for being nervous,\nZara.\"\n\n\"Oh, neither do I,\" said Dolly. \"But it was funny to think of his being\nso near you and having no idea of it. That's what would have made me\nlaugh.\"\n\n\"It seems funny enough, now,\" admitted Zara, with a smile. \"But, you\nsee, I was perfectly certain that he did have a very good idea of where\nI was. I was expecting him to take hold of me any moment, and tell the\nconstable to take me off the train.\"\n\n\"I wonder how long this sort of thing is going to keep up,\" said Margery\nBurton, angrily. \"Until you two girls are twenty-one?\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" laughed Bessie, and then she went on, more seriously, \"I\nreally do think that if Jake Hoover sticks to what he said, and takes\nour side, Mr. Jamieson is likely to find out something that will give\nhim a chance to settle matters. You see, we've been fighting in the dark\nso far.\"\n\n\"I don't see that we've been fighting at all, yet,\" said Margery. \"They\nkeep on trying to do something, and we manage to keep them from doing\nit. That's not my idea of a fight. I wish we could do some of the\nhitting ourselves.\"\n\n\"So do I, Margery. And that's just what I think we may be able to do\nnow, if we have Jake on our side. He must know something about what\nthey've been doing. They couldn't keep him from finding out, it seems to\nme.\"\n\n\"But will he tell? That seems to be the question.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it, exactly. Well, if he does, then we'll know why they're\ndoing all this. You see, Mr. Jamieson can't figure on what they're going\nto do next, or how to beat them at their own game, simply because he\ndoesn't know what their game is. They know just what they want to do,\nwhile we haven't any idea, except that they're anxious to have Zara and\nmyself back where Farmer Weeks can do as he likes with us.\"\n\n\"Well, it would be fine to be able to beat them, Bessie, but right now\nI'm more worried about what they will try to do next. This is a pretty\nlonely place we're going to, and they're so bold that there's no telling\nwhat they may try next.\"\n\n\"That's so--and they know we're coming here, too. Jake told them that.\"\n\n\"They would probably have found it out anyhow,\" said Dolly. \"And there's\none thing--he didn't try to warn them that you knew about what they\nmeant to do at Canton, Bessie.\"\n\n\"No, he didn't. And he could have done it very easily, too. Oh, I think\nwe can count on Jake now, all right. He's pretty badly frightened, and\nhe's worried about himself. He'll stick to the side that seems the most\nlikely to help him. All I hope is that he will go to see Mr. Jamieson.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will?\"\n\n\"Why not? Even if they get hold of him again, I think there will be time\nenough for him to see Mr. Jamieson first. And I've got an idea that Mr.\nJamieson will be able to scare him pretty badly.\"\n\n\"All out for Green Cove,\" called the conductor just then, appearing in\nthe doorway, and there was a rush for the end of the car.\n\n\"Well, here we are,\" said Eleanor. \"This isn't much of a city, is it?\"\n\nIt was not. Two or three bungalows and seashore cottages were in sight,\nbut most of the traffic for the Green Cove station came from scattered\nsettlements along the coast. It was a region where people liked to live\nalone, and they were willing to be some distance from the railroad to\nsecure the isolation that appealed to them. A little pier poked its nose\nout into the waters of the cove, and beside this pier was a gasoline\nlaunch, battered and worn, but amply able, as was soon proved, to carry\nall the girls and their belongings at a single load.\n\n\"Thought you wasn't coming,\" said the old sailor who owned the launch,\nas he helped them to get settled aboard.\n\n\"We missed the first connecting train and had to wait, Mr. Salters,\"\nsaid Eleanor. \"I hope you didn't sell the fish and clams you promised\nus to someone else?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said old Salters. \"They're waitin' for you at the camp,\nma'am, and I fixed up the place, too, all shipshape. The tents is all\nready, though why anyone should sleep in such contraptions when they can\nhave a comfortable house is more'n I can guess.\"\n\n\"Each to his taste, you know,\" laughed Eleanor. \"I suppose we'll be able\nto get you to take us out in the launch sometimes while we're here?\"\n\n\"Right, ma'am! As often as you like,\" he answered. \"My old boat here\nain't fashionable enough for some of the folk, but she's seaworthy, and\nshe won't get stuck a mile an' a half from nowhere, the way Harry Semmes\nand that new fangled boat of his done the other day when he had a load\nof young ladies aboard.\"\n\nHe chuckled at the recollection. But while he had been talking he had\nnot been idle, and the _Sally S._, as his launch was called, had been\nmaking slow but steady progress until she was outside the cove and\nheaded north. Soon, too, he ran her inside the protecting spot of land\nof which Dolly had spoken to Bessie, and they were in such smooth water\nthat, even had any of them had any tendency toward seasickness, there\nwould have been no excuse for it.\n\nIn half an hour he stopped the engine, and cast his anchor overboard. He\nwore no shoes and stockings, and now, rolling up his trousers, he jumped\noverboard.\n\n\"Hand me the dunnage first,\" he said. \"I'll get that ashore, and then\nI'll take the rest of you, one at a time.\"\n\n\"Indeed you won't,\" laughed Eleanor. \"We're not afraid of getting our\nfeet wet. Come on, girls, it's only two feet deep! Roll up your skirts\nand take off your shoes and stockings, and we'll wade ashore.\"\n\nShe set the example, and in a very short time they were all safely\nashore, with much laughter at the splashing that was involved.\n\n\"Mr. Salters could run the _Sally S._ ashore, but it would be a lot of\ntrouble to get her afloat again, and this is the way we always do here.\nIt's lots of fun really,\" Eleanor explained.\n\nSoon they were all ashore, and inspecting the camp which had been laid\nout in preparation for them.\n\n\"Real army tents, with regular floors and cots, these are,\" said\nEleanor. \"Sleeping on the ground wouldn't be very wise here. And there's\nno use taking chances. I'm responsible to the mothers and fathers of all\nyou girls, after all, and I'm bound to see that you go home better than\nwhen you started, instead of worse.\"\n\n\"I think they're fine,\" said Margery. \"Oh, I do love the seashore! How\nlong shall we stay, Miss Eleanor?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the Guardian, a shade of doubt darkening her eyes.\n\"You know, Margery\"--she spoke in a low tone--\"that seems to depend\npartly on things we can't really control. There seems to me to be\nsomething really quite desperate about the way Mr. Holmes and his\nfriends are going for Bessie and Zara.\n\n\"Maybe they will make trouble for us here. It is rather isolated, you\nknow, and I can't help remembering that we're on the coast, and that a\nfew miles away the coast is that of Bessie's state--the state she\nmustn't be in.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Margery, gravely. \"You mean that if they managed to\nget hold of Bessie or Zara, and took them out to sea and then landed\nthem in that state they'd be able to hold them there?\"\n\n\"It worries me, Margery. The trouble is, you see, that once they're in\nthat state, it doesn't matter how they were taken there, but they can be\nheld. If Zara's father gets free, why, he would be able to get her back,\nI suppose. Mr. Jamieson says so. But there's no one with a better right\nto Bessie, so far as we know. I'm really more worried about her than\nabout Zara.\"\n\n\"We'll all be careful,\" promised Margery, with fire in her eye. \"And I\nguess they'll have to be pretty smart to find any way of getting her\naway from us. I'll talk to the girls, and I'll try to be watching myself\nall the time.\"\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" announced Dolly. \"Just as hungry as a bear! Can't we have\nsupper pretty soon, Miss Eleanor?\"\n\n\"Supper?\" scoffed Miss Eleanor. \"Why, we haven't had our dinner yet! But\nwe'll have that just as soon as it's cooked. I've just been waiting for\nsomeone to say they were hungry. Dolly, you're elected cook. Since\nyou're the hungry one, you can cook the dinner.\"\n\n\"I certainly will! I'll get it all the sooner that way. May I pick out\nwho's to help me, Miss Eleanor?\"\n\n\"That's the rule. You certainly can.\"\n\n\"Then I pick out all the girls,\" announced Dolly. \"Every one of you--and\nno shirking, mind!\"\n\nShe laughed merrily, and in a moment she had set every girl to some\ntask. Even Margery obeyed her orders cheerfully, for the rule was\nthere, and, even though Dolly had twisted it a bit, it was recognized\nas a good joke. Moreover, everyone was hungry and wanted the meal to be\nready as soon as possible.\n\n\"There's good water at the top of that path,\" said Eleanor, pointing to\na path that led up a bluff that backed against the tents. \"I think maybe\nwe'll build a wooden pipe-line to bring the water right down here, but\nfor to-day we'll have to carry it from the spring there.\"\n\n\"Is there driftwood here for a camp fire, do you suppose, the way there\nwas last year, Miss Eleanor?\" asked one of the other girls. \"I'll never\nforget the lovely fires we had then!\"\n\n\"There's lots of it, I'm afraid,\" said Eleanor, gravely.\n\n\"Why are you 'afraid'?\" asked Bessie, wonderingly.\n\n\"Because all the driftwood, or most of it, comes from wrecked ships,\nBessie. This beach looks calm and peaceful now, but in the winter, when\nthe great northeast storms blow, this is a terrible coast, and lots and\nlots of ships are wrecked. Men are drowned very often, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, I never thought of that!\"\n\n\"Still, some of the wood is just lost from lumber schooners that are\nloaded too heavily,\" said Eleanor. \"And it certainly does make a\nbeautiful fire, all red and green and blue, and oh, all sorts of colors\nand shades you never even dreamed of! We'll have a ceremonial camp fire\nwhile we're here, and it is certainly true that there is no fire half so\nbeautiful as that we get when we use the wood that the sea casts up.\"\n\n\"Don't they often find lots of other things beside wood along the coast\nafter a great storm, Miss Eleanor?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed! There are people who make their living that way. Wreckers,\nthey call them, you know. Of course, it isn't as common to find really\nvaluable things now as it was in the old days.\"\n\n\"Why not? I thought more things were carried at sea than ever,\" said\nDolly.\n\n\"There aren't so many wrecks, Dolly, for one thing. And then, in the\nold days, before steam, and the great big ships they have now, even the\nmost valuable cargoes were carried in wooden ships that were at the\nmercy of these great storms.\"\n\n\"Oh, and now they send those things in the big ships that are safer, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Yes. You very seldom hear of an Atlantic liner being wrecked, you know.\nIt does happen once in a great while, of course, but they are much more\nlikely to reach the port they sail for than the old wooden ships. In the\nold days many and many a ship sailed that was never heard of, but you\ncould count the ships that have done that in the last few years on the\nfingers of one hand.\"\n\n\"But there was a frightful wreck not so very long ago, wasn't there? The\nTitanic?\"\n\n\"Yes. That was the most terrible disaster since men have gone to sea at\nall. You see, she was so much bigger, and could carry so many more\npeople than the old ships, that, when she did go down, it was naturally\nmuch worse. But the wreckers never made any profit out of her. She went\ndown in the middle of the ocean, and no one will ever see her again.\"\n\n\"Couldn't divers go down after her?\"\n\n\"No. She was too deep for that. Divers can only go down a certain\ndistance, because, below that, the pressure is too great, and they\nwouldn't live.\"\n\n\"Stop talking and attend to your dinner, Dolly,\" said Margery, suddenly.\n\"You pretended you were hungry, and now you're so busy talking that\nyou're forgetting about the rest of us. We're hungry, too. Just remember\nthat!\"\n\n\"I can talk and work at the same time,\" said Dolly. \"Is everything\nready? Because, if it is, so is dinner. Come on, girls! The clams first.\nI've cooked it--I'm not going to put it on the table, too.\"\n\n\"No, we ought to be glad to get any work out of her at all,\" laughed\nMargery, as she carried the steaming, savory clams to the table. \"I\nsuppose every time we want her to do some work the rest of the time\nwe're here, she'll tell us about this dinner.\"\n\n\"I won't have to,\" boasted Dolly. \"You'll all remember it. All I'm\nafraid of is that you won't be satisfied with the way anyone else cooks\nafter this. I've let myself out this time!\"\n\nIt _was_ a good dinner--a better dinner than anyone had thought Dolly\ncould cook. But, despite her jesting ways, Dolly was a close observer,\nand she had not watched Margery, a real genius in the art of cooking, in\nvain. Everyone enjoyed it, and, when they had eaten all they could,\nDolly lay back in the sand with Bessie.\n\n\"Well, wasn't I right? Don't you love this place?\" she asked.\n\n\"I certainly think I do,\" said Bessie. \"It's so peaceful and quiet. I\ndidn't believe any place could be as calm as the mountains, but I really\nthink this is.\"\n\n\"I love to hear the surf outside, too,\" said Dolly. \"It's as if it were\nsinging a lullaby. I think the surf, and the sighing of the wind in the\ntrees is the best music there is.\"\n\n\"Those noises were the real beginning of music, Dolly,\" said Eleanor.\n\"Did you know that? The very first music that was ever written was an\nattempt to imitate those songs of nature.\"\n\nAfter the dishes were washed and put away, everyone sat on the beach,\nwatching the sky darken. First one star and then another came out, and\nthe scene was one of idyllic beauty. And then, as if to complete it, a\nyacht appeared, small, but beautiful and graceful, steaming toward them.\nIts sides were lighted, and from its deck came the music of a violin,\nbeautifully played.\n\n\"Oh, how lovely that is!\" said Eleanor. \"Why, look! I do believe it is\ngoing to anchor!\"\n\nAnd, sure enough, the noise of the anchor chains came over the water.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS YACHT\n\n\nBut, beautiful as the yacht undoubtedly was, the sight of it and the\nsound of the slipping anchor chains brought a look of perplexity and\neven of distress to Eleanor's eyes.\n\n\"That's very curious,\" she said, thoughtfully. \"There are no cottages or\nbungalows near here. Those people can't be coming here just for a visit,\nor they would take another anchorage. And it's a strange thing for them\nto choose this cove if they are just cruising along the coast.\"\n\n\"There weren't any yachts here last year when we were camping,\" said\nMargery. \"But it is a lovely spot, and it's public land along here,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"No, not exactly. It won't be used for a long time, I expect, but it has\nan owner. An old gentleman in Bay City owns all the shore front along\nhere for half a mile, and he has been holding on to it with the idea\nthat it would get more valuable as time went on. Probably it will, too.\"\n\n\"Well, he lets people come here to camp, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. He's glad to have people here, I think, because he thinks that\nif they see how lovely it is, they will want to buy the land. I suppose\nperhaps these people on the yacht have permission from him to come here,\njust as we have. But I do wish they had waited until we had gone, or\nelse that they had come and gone before we got here at all.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will just stay for the night,\" said Margery. \"I should\nthink that a small boat like that would be very likely to put in\novernight, and do its sailing in the daytime. Probably the people on\nboard of her aren't in a hurry, and like to take things easily.\"\n\n\"Well, we won't find out anything about her to-night, I imagine,\" said\nEleanor. \"In the morning we'll probably learn what their plans are, and\nthen it will be time to make any changes that are necessary in our own\narrangements.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you wouldn't stay here if they did, Miss Eleanor?\"\n\n\"I won't say that, Margery. We don't know who they are yet. They may be\nvery nice people--there's no way of telling to-night. But if they turn\nout to be undesirable, we can move quite easily, I think. There are\nplenty of other beaches nearby where we'll be just as comfortable as we\nare here.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I don't believe any of them are as beautiful as this one, Miss\nEleanor.\"\n\n\"Neither do I, Margery. Still, we can't always pick and choose the\nthings we do, or always do what pleases us best.\"\n\nOn the yacht everything seemed to be quiet. When the anchor had gone\ndown, the violin playing ceased, and, though the girls strained their\nears to listen, there was no sound of conversation, such as might\nreasonably have been expected to come across the quiet water. Still\nthere was nothing strange about that. It might well be that everyone on\nboard was below, eating supper, and in that case voices would probably\nnot come to them.\n\n\"I'd like to own that yacht,\" said Dolly, gazing at her enviously. \"What\na lot of fun you could have with her, Bessie! Think of all the places\none could see."}
{"ID": 792, "text": "But the common sense of men knows better. Every real religious thought denies it. After all,\nthe real God of the Christians is Christ, not God Almighty; a poor mocked and wounded God nailed\non a cross of matter.... Some day He will triumph.... But it is not fair to say that He causes\nall things now. It is not fair to make out a case against him. You have been misled. It is\na theologian's folly. God is not absolute; God is finite.... A finite God who struggles in\nhis great and comprehensive way as we struggle in our weak and silly way--who is _with_ us--that\nis the essence of all real religion.... I agree with you so--Why! if I thought there was an\nomnipotent God who looked down on battles and deaths and all the waste and horror of this war--able\nto prevent these things--doing them to amuse Himself--I would spit in his empty face....\"\n\n\"Any one would....\"\n\n\"But it's your teachers and catechisms have set you against God.... They want to make out He\nowns all Nature. And all sorts of silly claims. Like the heralds in the Middle Ages who insisted\nthat Christ was certainly a great gentleman entitled to bear arms. But God is within Nature\nand necessity. Necessity is a thing beyond God--beyond good and ill, beyond space and time,\na mystery everlastingly impenetrable. God is nearer than that. Necessity is the uttermost thing,\nbut God is the innermost thing. Closer He is than breathing and nearer than hands and feet.\nHe is the Other Thing than this world. Greater than Nature or Necessity, for he is a spirit\nand they are blind, but not controlling them.... Not yet....\"\n\n\"They always told me He was the maker of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n\"That's the Jew God the Christians took over. It's a Quack God, a Panacea. It's not my God.\"\n\nLetty considered these strange ideas.\n\n\"I never thought of Him like that,\" she said at last. \"It makes it all seem different.\"\n\n\"Nor did I. But I do now.... I have suddenly found it and seen it plain. I see it so plain\nthat I am amazed that I have not always seen it.... It is, you see, so easy to understand that\nthere is a God, and how complex and wonderful and brotherly He is, when one thinks of those\ndear boys who by the thousand, by the hundred thousand, have laid down their lives.... Ay,\nand there were German boys too who did the same.... The cruelties, the injustice, the brute\naggression--they saw it differently. They laid down their lives--they laid down their lives....\nThose dear lives, those lives of hope and sunshine....\n\n\"Don't you see that it must be like that, Letty? Don't you see that it must be like that?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I've seen things differently from that.\"\n\n\"But it's so plain to me,\" said Mr. Britling. \"If there was nothing else in all the world but\nour kindness for each other, or the love that made you weep in this kind October sunshine,\nor the love I bear Hugh--if there was nothing else at all--if everything else was cruelty and\nmockery and filthiness and bitterness, it would still be certain that there was a God of love\nand righteousness. If there were no signs of God in all the world but the godliness we have\nseen in those two boys of ours; if we had no other light but the love we have between us....\n\n\"You don't mind if I talk like this?\" said Mr. Britling. \"It's all I can think of now--this\nGod, this God who struggles, who was in Hugh and Teddy, clear and plain, and how He must become\nthe ruler of the world....\"\n\n\"This God who struggles,\" she repeated. \"I have never thought of Him like that.\"\n\n\"Of course He must be like that,\" said Mr. Britling. \"How can God be a Person; how can He be\nanything that matters to man, unless He is limited and defined and--human like ourselves....\nWith things outside Him and beyond Him.\"\n\nSection 11\n\nLetty walked back slowly through the fields of stubble to her cottage.\n\nShe had been talking to Mr. Britling for an hour, and her mind was full of the thought of this\nchanged and simplified man, who talked of God as he might have done of a bird he had seen or\nof a tree he had sheltered under. And all mixed up with this thought of Mr. Britling was this\nstrange idea of God who was also a limited person, who could come as close as Teddy, whispering\nlove in the darkness. She had a ridiculous feeling that God really struggled like Mr. Britling,\nand that with only some indefinable inferiority of outlook Mr. Britling loved like God. She\nloved him for his maps and his dreams and the bareness of his talk to her. It was strange how\nthe straining thought of the dead Teddy had passed now out of her mind. She was possessed by\na sense of ending and beginning, as though a page had turned over in her life and everything\nwas new. She had never given religion any thought but contemptuous thought for some years,\nsince indeed her growing intelligence had dismissed it as a scheme of inexcusable restraints\nand empty pretences, a thing of discords where there were no discords except of its making.\nShe had been a happy Atheist. She had played in the sunshine, a natural creature with the completest\nconfidence in the essential goodness of the world in which she found herself. She had refused\nall thought of painful and disagreeable things. Until the bloody paw of war had wiped out all\nher assurance. Teddy, the playmate, was over, the love game was ended for ever; the fresh happy\nacceptance of life as life; and in the place of Teddy was the sorrow of life, the pity of life,\nand this coming of God out of utter remoteness into a conceivable relation to her own existence.\n\nShe had left Mr. Britling to his atlas. He lay prone under the hedge with it spread before\nhim. His occupation would have seemed to her only a little while ago the absurdest imaginable.\nHe was drawing boundaries on his maps very carefully in red ink, with a fountain pen. But now\nshe understood.\n\nShe knew that those red ink lines of Mr. Britling's might in the end prove wiser and stronger\nthan the bargains of the diplomats....\n\nIn the last hour he had come very near to her. She found herself full of an unwonted affection\nfor him. She had never troubled her head about her relations with any one except Teddy before.\nNow suddenly she seemed to be opening out to all the world for kindness. This new idea of a\nfriendly God, who had a struggle of his own, who could be thought of as kindred to Mr. Britling,\nas kindred to Teddy--had gripped her imagination. He was behind the autumnal sunshine; he was\nin the little bird that had seemed so confident and friendly. Whatever was kind, whatever was\ntender; there was God. And a thousand old phrases she had read and heard and given little heed\nto, that had lain like dry bones in her memory, suddenly were clothed in flesh and became alive.\nThis God--if this was God--then indeed it was not nonsense to say that God was love, that he\nwas a friend and companion.... With him it might be possible to face a world in which Teddy\nand she would never walk side by side again nor plan any more happiness for ever. After all\nshe had been very happy; she had had wonderful happiness. She had had far more happiness, far\nmore love, in her short years or so than most people had in their whole lives. And so in the\nreaction of her emotions, Letty, who had gone out with her head full of murder and revenge,\ncame back through the sunset thinking of pity, of the thousand kindnesses and tendernesses\nof Teddy that were, after all, perhaps only an intimation of the limitless kindnesses and tendernesses\nof God.... What right had she to a white and bitter grief, self-centred and vindictive, while\nold Britling could still plan an age of mercy in the earth and a red-gold sunlight that was\nwarm as a smile from Teddy lay on all the world....\n\nShe must go into the cottage and kiss Cissie, and put away that parcel out of sight until she\ncould find some poor soldier to whom she could send it. She had been pitiless towards Cissie\nin her grief. She had, in the egotism of her sorrow, treated Cissie as she might have treated\na chair or a table, with no thought that Cissie might be weary, might dream of happiness still\nto come. Cissie had still to play the lover, and her man was already in khaki. There would\nbe no such year as Letty had had in the days before the war darkened the world. Before Cissie's\nmarrying the peace must come, and the peace was still far away. And Direck too would have to\ntake his chances....\n\nLetty came through the little wood and over the stile that brought her into sight of the cottage.\nThe windows of the cottage as she saw it under the bough of the big walnut tree, were afire\nfrom the sun. The crimson rambler over the porch that she and Teddy had planted was still bearing\nroses. The door was open and people were moving in the porch.\n\nSome one was coming out of the cottage, a stranger, in an unfamiliar costume, and behind him\nwas a man in khaki--but that was Mr. Direck! And behind him again was Cissie.\n\nBut the stranger!\n\nHe came out of the frame of the porch towards the garden gate....\n\nWho--who was this stranger?\n\nIt was a man in queer-looking foreign clothes, baggy trousers of some soft-looking blue stuff\nand a blouse, and he had a white-bandaged left arm. He had a hat stuck at the back of his head,\nand a beard....\n\nHe was entirely a stranger, a foreigner. Was she going insane? Of course he was a stranger!\n\nAnd then he moved a step, he made a queer sideways pace, a caper, on the path, and instantly\nhe ceased to be strange and foreign. He became amazingly, incredibly, familiar by virtue of\nthat step....\n\n_No!_\n\nHer breath stopped. All Letty's being seemed to stop. And this stranger who was also incredibly\nfamiliar, after he had stared at her motionless form for a moment, waved his hat with a gesture--a\ngesture that crowned and scaled the effect of familiarity. She gave no sign in reply.\n\nNo, that familiarity was just a mad freakishness in things.\n\nThis strange man came from Belgium perhaps, to tell something about Teddy....\n\nAnd then she surprised herself by making a groaning noise, an absurd silly noise, just like\nthe noise when one imitates a cow to a child. She said \"Mooo-oo.\"\n\nAnd she began to run forward, with legs that seemed misfits, waving her hands about, and as\nshe ran she saw more and more certainly that this wounded man in strange clothing was Teddy.\nShe ran faster and still faster, stumbling and nearly falling. If she did not get to him speedily\nthe world would burst.\n\nTo hold him, to hold close to him!...\n\n\"Letty! Letty! Just one arm....\"\n\nShe was clinging to him and he was holding her....\n\nIt was all right. She had always known it was all right. (Hold close to him.) Except just for\na little while. But that had been foolishness. Hadn't she always known he was alive? And here\nhe was alive! (Hold close to him.) Only it was so good to be sure--after all her torment; to\nhold him, to hang about him, to feel the solid man, kissing her, weeping too, weeping together\nwith her. \"Teddy my love!\"\n\nSection 12\n\nLetty was in the cottage struggling to hear and understand things too complicated for her emotion-crowded\nmind. There was something that Mr. Direck was trying to explain about a delayed telegram that\nhad come soon after she had gone out. There was much indeed that Mr. Direck was trying to explain.\nWhat did any explanation really matter when you had Teddy, with nothing but a strange beard\nand a bandaged arm between him and yourself? She had an absurd persuasion at first that those\ntwo strangenesses would also presently be set aside, so that Teddy would become just exactly\nwhat Teddy had always been.\n\nTeddy had been shot through the upper arm....\n\n\"My hand has gone, dear little Letty. It's my left hand, luckily. I shall have to wear a hook\nlike some old pirate....\"\n\nThere was something about his being taken prisoner. \"That other officer\"--that was Mr. Direck's\nofficer--\"had been lying there for days.\" Teddy had been shot through the upper arm, and stunned\nby a falling beam. When he came to he was disarmed, with a German standing over him....\n\nThen afterwards he had escaped. In quite a little time he had escaped. He had been in a railway\nstation somewhere in Belgium; locked in a waiting-room with three or four French prisoners,\nand the junction had been bombed by French and British aeroplanes. Their guard and two of the\nprisoners had been killed. In the confusion the others had got away into the town. There were\ntrucks of hay on fire, and a store of petrol was in danger. \"After that one was bound to escape.\nOne would have been shot if one had been found wandering about.\"\n\nThe bomb had driven some splinters of glass and corrugated iron into Teddy's wrist; it seemed\na small place at first; it didn't trouble him for weeks. But then some dirt got into it.\n\nIn the narrow cobbled street beyond the station he had happened upon a woman who knew no English,\nbut who took him to a priest, and the priest had hidden him.\n\nLetty did not piece together the whole story at first. She did not want the story very much;\nshe wanted to know about this hand and arm.\n\nThere would be queer things in the story when it came to be told. There was an old peasant\nwho had made Teddy work in his fields in spite of his smashed and aching arm, and who had pointed\nto a passing German when Teddy demurred; there were the people called \"they\" who had at that\ntime organised the escape of stragglers into Holland. There was the night watch, those long\nnights in succession before the dash for liberty. But Letty's concern was all with the hand.\nInside the sling there was something that hurt the imagination, something bandaged, a stump.\nShe could not think of it. She could not get away from the thought of it.\n\n\"But why did you lose your hand?\"\n\nIt was only a little place at first, and then it got painful....\n\n\"But I didn't go into a hospital because I was afraid they would intern me, and so I wouldn't\nbe able to come home. And I was dying to come home. I was--homesick. No one was ever so homesick.\nI've thought of this place and the garden, and how one looked out of the window at the passers-by,\na thousand times. I seemed always to be seeing them. Old Dimple with his benevolent smile,\nand Mrs. Wolker at the end cottage, and how she used to fetch her beer and wink when she caught\nus looking at her, and little Charlie Slobberface sniffing on his way to the pigs and all the\nrest of them. And you, Letty. Particularly you. And how we used to lean on the window-sill\nwith our shoulders touching, and your cheek just in front of my eyes.... And nothing aching\nat all in one....\n\n\"How I thought of that and longed for that!...\n\n\"And so, you see, I didn't go to the hospital. I kept hoping to get to England first. And I\nleft it too long....\"\n\n\"Life's come back to me with you!\" said Letty. \"Until just to-day I've believed you'd come\nback. And to-day--I doubted.... I thought it was all over--all the real life, love and the\ndear fun of things, and that there was nothing before me, nothing before me but just holding\nout--and keeping your memory.... Poor arm. Poor arm. And being kind to people. And pretending\nyou were alive somewhere.... I'll not care about the arm. In a little while.... I'm glad you've\ngone, but I'm gladder you're back and can never go again.... And I will be your right hand,\ndear, and your left hand and all your hands. Both my hands for your dear lost left one. You\nshall have three hands instead of two....\"\n\nSection 13\n\nLetty stood by the window as close as she could to Teddy in a world that seemed wholly made\nup of unexpected things. She could not heed the others, it was only when Teddy spoke to the\nothers, or when they spoke to Teddy, that they existed for her.\n\nFor instance, Teddy was presently talking to Mr. Direck.\n\nThey had spoken about the Canadians who had come up and relieved the Essex men after the fight\nin which Teddy had been captured. And then it was manifest that Mr. Direck was talking of his\nregiment. \"I'm not the only American who has gone Canadian--for the duration of the war.\"\n\nHe had got to his explanation at last.\n\n\"I've told a lie,\" he said triumphantly. \"I've shifted my birthplace six hundred miles.\n\n\"Mind you, I don't admit a thing that Cissie has ever said about America--not one thing. You\ndon't understand the sort of proposition America is up against. America is the New World, where\nthere are no races and nations any more; she is the Melting Pot, from which we will cast the\nbetter state. I've believed that always--in spite of a thousand little things I believe it\nnow. I go back on nothing. I'm not fighting as an American either. I'm fighting simply as myself....\nI'm not going fighting for England, mind you. Don't you fancy that. I don't know I'm so particularly\nin love with a lot of English ways as to do that. I don't see how any one can be very much\nin love with your Empire, with its dead-alive Court, its artful politicians, its lords and\nladies and snobs, its way with the Irish and its way with India, and everybody shifting responsibility\nand telling lies about your common people. I'm not going fighting for England. I'm going fighting\nfor Cissie--and justice and Belgium and all that--but more particularly for Cissie. And anyhow\nI can't look Pa Britling in the face any more.... And I want to see those trenches--close.\nI reckon they're a thing it will be interesting to talk about some day.... So I'm going,\" said\nMr. Direck. \"But chiefly--it's Cissie. See?\"\n\nCissie had come and stood by the side of him.\n\nShe looked from poor broken Teddy to him and back again.\n\n\"Up to now,\" she said, \"I've wanted you to go....\"\n\nTears came into her eyes.\n\n\"I suppose I must let you go,\" she said. \"Oh! I'd hate you not to go....\"\n\nSection 14\n\n\"Good God! how old the Master looks!\" cried Teddy suddenly.\n\nHe was standing at the window, and as Mr. Direck came forward inquiringly he pointed to the\nfigure of Mr. Britling passing along the road towards the Dower House.\n\n\"He does look old. I hadn't noticed,\" said Mr. Direck.\n\n\"Why, he's gone grey!\" cried Teddy, peering. \"He wasn't grey when I left.\"\n\nThey watched the knickerbockered figure of Mr. Britling receding up the hill, atlas and papers\nin his hands behind his back.\n\n\"I must go out to him,\" said Teddy, disengaging himself from Letty.\n\n\"No,\" she said, arresting him with her hand.\n\n\"But he will be glad--\"\n\nShe stood in her husband's way. She had a vision of Mr. Britling suddenly called out of his\ndreams of God ruling the united states of the world, to rejoice at Teddy's restoration....\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"it will only make him think again of Hugh--and how he died. Don't go out,\nTeddy. Not now. What does he care for _you_?... Let him rest from such things.... Leave him\nto dream over his atlas.... He isn't so desolate--if you knew.... I will tell you, Teddy--when\nI can....\n\n\"But just now--No, he will think of Hugh again.... Let him go.... He has God and his atlas\nthere.... They're more than you think.\"\n\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\n\nMR. BRITLING WRITES UNTIL SUNRISE\n\nSection 1\n\nIt was some weeks later. It was now the middle of November, and Mr. Britling, very warmly wrapped\nin his thick dressing-gown and his thick llama wool pyjamas, was sitting at his night desk,\nand working ever and again at an essay, an essay of preposterous ambitions, for the title of\nit was \"The Better Government of the World.\"\n\nLatterly he had had much sleepless misery. In the day life was tolerable, but in the night--unless\nhe defended himself by working, the losses and cruelties of the war came and grimaced at him,\ninsufferably. Now he would be haunted by long processions of refugees, now he would think of\nthe dead lying stiff and twisted in a thousand dreadful attitudes. Then again he would be overwhelmed\nwith anticipations of the frightful economic and social dissolution that might lie ahead....\nAt other times he thought of wounds and the deformities of body and spirit produced by injuries.\nAnd sometimes he would think of the triumph of evil. Stupid and triumphant persons went about\na world that stupidity had desolated, with swaggering gestures, with a smiling consciousness\nof enhanced importance, with their scornful hatred of all measured and temperate and kindly\nthings turned now to scornful contempt. And mingling with the soil they walked on lay the dead\nbody of Hugh, face downward. At the back of the boy's head, rimmed by blood-stiffened hair--the\nhair that had once been \"as soft as the down of a bird\"--was a big red hole. That hole was\nalways pitilessly distinct. They stepped on him--heedlessly. They heeled the scattered stuff\nof his exquisite brain into the clay....\n\nFrom all such moods of horror Mr. Britling's circle of lamplight was his sole refuge. His work\ncould conjure up visions, like opium visions, of a world of order and justice. Amidst the gloom\nof world bankruptcy he stuck to the prospectus of a braver enterprise--reckless of his chances\nof subscribers....\n\nSection 2\n\nBut this night even this circle of lamplight would not hold his mind. Doubt had crept into\nthis last fastness. He pulled the papers towards him, and turned over the portion he had planned.\n\nHis purpose in the book he was beginning to write was to reason out the possible methods of\ngovernment that would give a stabler, saner control to the world. He believed still in democracy,\nbut he was realising more and more that democracy had yet to discover its method. It had to\ntake hold of the consciences of men, it had to equip itself with still unformed organisations.\nEndless years of patient thinking, of experimenting, of discussion lay before mankind ere this\ngreat idea could become reality, and right, the proven right thing, could rule the earth.\n\nMeanwhile the world must still remain a scene of blood-stained melodrama, of deafening noise,\ncontagious follies, vast irrational destructions. One fine life after another went down from\nstudy and university and laboratory to be slain and silenced....\n\nWas it conceivable that this mad monster of mankind would ever be caught and held in the thin-spun\nwebs of thought?\n\nWas it, after all, anything but pretension and folly for a man to work out plans for the better\ngovernment of the world?--was it any better than the ambitious scheming of some fly upon the\nwheel of the romantic gods?\n\nMan has come, floundering and wounding and suffering, out of the breeding darknesses of Time,\nthat will presently crush and consume him again. Why not flounder with the rest, why not eat,\ndrink, fight, scream, weep and pray, forget Hugh, stop brooding upon Hugh, banish all these\npriggish dreams of \"The Better Government of the World,\" and turn to the brighter aspects,\nthe funny and adventurous aspects of the war, the Chestertonian jolliness, _Punch_ side of\nthings? Think you because your sons are dead that there will be no more cakes and ale? Let\nmankind blunder out of the mud and blood as mankind has blundered in....\n\nLet us at any rate keep our precious Sense of Humour....\n\nHe pulled his manuscript towards him. For a time he sat decorating the lettering of his title,\n\"The Better Government of the World,\" with little grinning gnomes' heads and waggish tails....\n\nSection 3\n\nOn the top of Mr. Britling's desk, beside the clock, lay a letter, written in clumsy English\nand with its envelope resealed by a label which testified that it had been \"OPENED BY CENSOR.\"\n\nThe friendly go-between in Norway had written to tell Mr. Britling that Herr Heinrich also\nwas dead; he had died a wounded prisoner in Russia some months ago. He had been wounded and\ncaptured, after undergoing great hardships, during the great Russian attack upon the passes\nof the Carpathians in the early spring, and his wound had mortified. He had recovered partially\nfor a time, and then he had been beaten and injured again in some struggle between German and\nCroatian prisoners, and he had sickened and died. Before he died he had written to his parents,\nand once again he had asked that the fiddle he had left in Mr. Britling's care should if possible\nbe returned to them. It was manifest that both for him and them now it had become a symbol\nwith many associations.\n\nThe substance of this letter invaded the orange circle of the lamp; it would have to be answered,\nand the potentialities of the answer were running through Mr. Britling's brain to the exclusion\nof any impersonal composition. He thought of the old parents away there in Pomerania--he believed\nbut he was not quite sure, that Heinrich had been an only son--and of the pleasant spectacled\nfigure that had now become a broken and decaying thing in a prisoner's shallow grave....\n\nAnother son had gone--all the world was losing its sons....\n\nHe found himself thinking of young Heinrich in the very manner, if with a lesser intensity,\nin which he thought about his own son, as of hopes senselessly destroyed. His mind took no\nnote of the fact that Heinrich was an enemy, that by the reckoning of a \"war of attrition\"\nhis death was balance and compensation for the death of Hugh. He went straight to the root\nfact that they had been gallant and kindly beings, and that the same thing had killed them both....\n\nBy no conceivable mental gymnastics could he think of the two as antagonists. Between them\nthere was no imaginable issue. They had both very much the same scientific disposition; with\nperhaps more dash and inspiration in the quality of Hugh; more docility and method in the case\nof Karl. Until war had smashed them one against the other....\n\nHe recalled his first sight of Heinrich at the junction, and how he had laughed at the sight\nof his excessive Teutonism. The close-cropped shining fair head surmounted by a yellowish-white\ncorps cap had appeared dodging about among the people upon the platform, and manifestly asking\nquestions. The face had been very pink with the effort of an unaccustomed tongue. The young\nman had been clad in a suit of white flannel refined by a purple line; his boots were of that\ngreenish yellow leather that only a German student could esteem \"chic\"; his rucksack was upon\nhis back, and the precious fiddle in its case was carried very carefully in one hand; this\nsame dead fiddle. The other hand held a stick with a carved knob and a pointed end. He had\nbeen too German for belief. \"Herr Heinrich!\" Mr. Britling had said, and straightway the heels\nhad clashed together for a bow, a bow from the waist, a bow that a heedless old lady much burthened\nwith garden produce had greatly disarranged."}

{"ID": 921, "text": "\nIt is one of the attributes of God, one of the perfections which we\ncontemplate in our idea of him, that there is no duality or\nopposition between his will and his vision, between the impulses\nof his nature and the events of his life. This is what we commonly\ndesignate as omnipotence and creation.  Now, in the contemplation\nof beauty, our faculties of perception have the same perfection: it is\nindeed from the experience of beauty and happiness, from the\noccasional harmony between our nature and our environment, that\nwe draw our conception of the divine life. There is, then, a real\npropriety in calling beauty a manifestation of God to the senses,\nsince, in the region of sense, the perception of beauty exemplifies\nthat adequacy and perfection which in general we objectify in an\nidea of God.\n\nBut the minds that dwell in the atmosphere of these analogies are\nhardly those that will care to ask what are the conditions and the\nvarieties of this perfection of function, in other words, how it\ncomes about that we perceive beauty at all, or have any inkling of\ndivinity. Only the other philosophers, those that wallow in\nEpicurus' sty, know anything about the latter question. But it is\neasier to be impressed than to be instructed, and the public is very\nready to believe that where there is noble language not\nwithout obscurity there must be profound knowledge. We should\ndistinguish, however, the two distinct demands in the case. One is\nfor comprehension; we look for the theory of a human function\nwhich must cover all possible cases of its exercise, whether noble\nor base. This the Platonists utterly fail to give us. The other\ndemand is for inspiration; we wish to be nourished by the maxims\nand confessions of an exalted mind, in whom the aesthetic function\nis pre-eminent. By responding to this demand the same thinkers\nmay win our admiration.\n\nTo feel beauty is a better thing than to understand how we come to\nfeel it. To have imagination and taste, to love the best, to be carried\nby the contemplation of nature to a vivid faith in the ideal, all this\nis more, a great deal more, than any science can hope to be."}

{"ID": 261, "text": " Come in, Antony, and let me wash it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, madam, I need nothing here,\" said Antony, stalking proudly off; while Humfrey,\nexclaiming \"Don't be an ass, Tony!-- Mother, no one would care to ask what we had given one\nanother black eyes for in a friendly way,\" tried to hold him back, and he did linger when Cis\nadded her persuasions to him not to return the spectacle he was at present.\n\n\"If this lady will promise not to betray an unfortunate Queen,\" he said, as if permission to\ndeal with his bruises were a great reward.\n\n\"Oh! you foolish boy!\" exclaimed Mistress Talbot, \"you were never meant for a plotter! you\nhave yourself betrayed that you are her messenger.\"\n\n\"And I am not ashamed of it,\" said Antony, holding his head high. \"Madam, madam, if you have\nsurprised this from me, you are the more bound not to betray her.  Think, lady, if you were\nshut up from your children and friends, would you not seek to send tidings to them?\"\n\n\"Child, child!  Heaven knows I am not blaming the poor lady within there.  I am only thinking\nwhat is right.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Antony, somewhat hopefully, \"if that be all, give me back the packet, or tear\nit up, if you will, and there can be no harm done.\"\n\n\"Oh, do so, sweet mother,\" entreated Cis, earnestly; \"he will never bid me go to Tibbott again.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Humfrey, \"then no tales will be told.\"\n\nFor even he, with all his trustworthiness, or indeed because of it, could not bear to bring\na comrade to disgrace; but the dilemma was put an end to by the sudden appearance on the scene\nof Captain Richard himself, demanding the cause of the disturbance, and whether his sons had\nbeen misbehaving to their guest.\n\n\"Dear sir, sweet father, do not ask,\" entreated Cis, springing to him, and taking his hand,\nas she was privileged to do; \"mother has come, and it is all made up and over now.\"\n\nRichard Talbot, however, had seen the packet which his wife was holding, and her anxious, perplexed\ncountenance, and the perilous atmosphere of suspicion around him made it incumbent on him to\nturn to her and say, \"What means this, mother?  Is it as Cis would have me believe, a mere\nchildish quarrel that I may pass over? or what is this packet?\"\n\n\"Master Babington saith it is a dog-whistle which he was leaving in charge with Cis to exchange\nfor another with Huckstress Tibbott,\" she answered.\n\n\"Feel,--nay, open it, and see if it be not, sir,\" cried Antony.\n\n\"I doubt not that so it is,\" said the captain; \"but you know, Master Babington, that it is\nthe duty of all here in charge to let no packet pass the gate which has not been viewed by\nmy lord's officers.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I will take it back again,\" said Antony, with a vain attempt at making his brow\nfrank and clear.\n\nInstead of answering.  Captain Talbot took the knife from his girdle, and cut in twain the\nyarn that bound the packet.  There was no doubt about the whistle being there, nor was there\nanything written on the wrapper; but perhaps the anxiety in Antony's eye, or even the old association\nwith boatswains, incited Mr. Talbot to put the whistle to his lips.  Not a sound would come\nforth.  He looked in, and saw what led him to blow with all his force, when a white roll of\npaper protruded, and on another blast fell out into his hand.\n\nHe held it up as he found it, and looked full at Antony, who exclaimed in much agitation, \"To\nkeep out the dust.  Only to keep out the dust.  It is all gibberish--from my old writing-books.\"\n\n\"That will we see,\" said Richard very gravely.\n\n\"Mistress, be pleased to give this young gentleman some water to wash his face, and attend\nto his bruises, keeping him in the guest-chamber without speech from any one until I return.\nMaster Babington, I counsel you to submit quietly.  I wish, and my Lord will wish, to spare\nhis ward as much scandal as possible, and if this be what you say it is, mere gibberish from\nyour exercise-books, you will be quit for chastisement for a forbidden act, which has brought\nyou into suspicion.  If not, it must be as my Lord thinks good.\"\n\nAntony made no entreaties.  Perhaps he trusted that what was unintelligible to himself might\npass for gibberish with others; perhaps the headache caused by Humfrey's fists was assisting\nto produce a state of sullen indifference after his burst of eager chivalry; at any rate he\nlet Mistress Talbot lead him away without resistance.  The other children would have followed,\nbut their father detained them to hear the particulars of the commission and the capture. \nRichard desired to know from his son whether he had any reason for suspecting underhand measures;\nand when Humfrey looked down and hesitated, added, \"On your obedience, boy; this is no slight\nmatter.\"\n\n\"You will not beat Cis, father?\" said Humfrey.\n\n\"Wherefore should I beat her, save for doing errands that yonder lad should have known better\nthan to thrust on her?\"\n\n\"Nay, sir, 'tis not for that; but my mother said she should be beaten if ever she spake of\nthe fortune yonder Tibbott told her, and we are sure that she--Tibbott I mean--is a witch,\nand knows more than she ought.\"\n\n\"What mean'st thou?  Tell me, children;\" and Cis, nothing loath, since she was secured from\nthe beating, related the augury which had left so deep an impression on her, Humfrey bearing\nwitness that it was before they knew themselves of Cicely's history.\n\n\"But that is not all,\" added Cicely, seeing Mr. Talbot less impressed than she expected by\nthese supernatural powers of divination.  \"She can change from a woman to a man!\"\n\n\"In sooth!\" exclaimed Richard, startled enough by this information.\n\n\"Yea, father,\" said Cicely, \"Faithful Ekins, the carrier's boy, saw her, in doublet and hose,\nand a tawny cloak, going along the road to Chesterfield.  He knew her by the halt in her left leg.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said Richard, \"and how long hast thou known this?\"\n\n\"Only yestermorn,\" said Cis; \"it was that which made me so much afraid to have any dealings\nwith her.\"\n\n\"She shall trouble thee no more, my little wench,\" said Richard in a tone that made Humfrey\ncry out joyously,\n\n\"O father! sweet father! wilt thou duck her for a witch?  Sink or swim! that will be rare!\"\n\n\"Hush, hush! foolish lad,\" said Richard, \"and thou, Cicely, take good heed that not a word\nof all this gets abroad.  Go to thy mother, child,--nay, I am not wroth with thee, little one.\nThou hast not done amiss, but bear in mind that nought is ever taken out of the park without\nknowledge of me or of thy mother.\"\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE BLAST OF THE WHISTLE.\n\nRichard Talbot was of course convinced that witchcraft was not likely to be the most serious\npart of the misdeeds of Tibbott the huckstress.  Committing Antony Babington to the custody\nof his wife, he sped on his way back to the Manor-house, where Lord Shrewsbury was at present\nresiding, the Countess being gone to view her buildings at Chatsworth, taking her daughter\nBessie with her.  He sent in a message desiring to speak to my lord in his privy chamber.\n\nFrancis Talbot came to him.  \"Is it matter of great moment, Dick?\" he said, \"for my father\nis so fretted and chafed, I would fain not vex him further to-night.--What! know you not? \nHere are tidings that my lady hath married Bess--yes, Bess Cavendish, in secret to my young\nLord Lennox, the brother of this Queen's unlucky husband!  How he is to clear himself before\nher Grace of being concerned in it, I know not, for though Heaven wots that he is as innocent\nas the child unborn, she will suspect him!\"\n\n\"I knew she flew high for Mistress Bess,\" returned Richard.\n\n\"High! nothing would serve her save royal blood!  My poor father says as sure as the lions\nand fleur-de-lis have come into a family, the headsman's axe has come after them.\"\n\n\"However it is not our family.\"\n\n\"So I tell him, but it gives him small comfort,\" said Frank, \"looking as he doth on the Cavendish\nbrood as his own, and knowing that there will be a mighty coil at once with my lady and these\ntwo queens.  He is sore vexed to-night, and saith that never was Earl, not to say man, so baited\nby woman as he, and he bade me see whether yours be a matter of such moment that it may not\nwait till morning or be despatched by me.\"\n\n\"That is for you to say, Master Francis.  What think you of this for a toy?\" as he produced\nthe parcel with the whistle and its contents. \"I went home betimes to-day, as you know, and\nfound my boy Humfrey had just made young Master Babington taste of his fists for trying to\nmake our little wench pass this packet to yonder huckster-woman who was succoured some months\nback by the Queen of Scots.\"\n\nFrancis Talbot silently took the whistle and unrolled the long narrow strip of paper.  \"This\nis the cipher,\" said he, \"the cipher used in corresponding with her French kin; Phillipps the\ndecipherer showed me the trick of it when he was at Tutbury in the time of the Duke of Norfolk's\nbusiness.  Soh! your son hath done good service, Richard. That lad hath been tampered with\nthen, I thought he was over thick with the lady in the lodge.  Where is he, the young traitor?\"\n\n\"At Bridgefield, under my wife's ward, having his bruises attended to.  I would not bring him\nup here till I knew what my Lord would have done with him.  He is but a child, and no doubt\nwas wrought with by sweet looks, and I trust my Lord will not be hard with him.\"\n\n\"If my father had hearkened to me, he should never have been here,\" said Francis.  \"His father\nwas an honest man, but his mother was, I find, a secret recusant, and when she died, young\nAntony was quite old enough to have sucked in the poison.  You did well to keep him, Richard;\nhe ought not to return hither again, either in ward or at liberty.\"\n\n\"If he were mine, I would send him to school,\" said Richard, \"where the masters and the lads\nwould soon drive out of him all dreams about captive princesses and seminary priests to boot.\nFor, Cousin Francis, I would have you to know that my children say there is a rumour that this\nwoman Tibbott the huckstress hath been seen in a doublet and hose near Chesterfield.\"\n\n\"The villain!  When is she looked for here again?\"\n\n\"Anon, I should suppose, judging by the boy leaving this charge with Cis in case she should\ncome while he is gone to Chatsworth.\"\n\n\"We will take order as to that,\" said Francis, compressing his lips; \"I know you will take\nheed, cousin, that she, or he, gets no breath of warning.  I should not wonder if it were Parsons\nhimself!\" and he unfolded the scroll with the air of a man seeking to confirm his triumph.\n\n\"Can you make anything of it?\" asked Richard, struck by its resemblance to another scroll laid\nup among his wife's treasures.\n\n\"I cannot tell, they are not matters to be read in an hour,\" said Francis Talbot, \"moreover,\nthere is one in use for the English traitors, her friends, and another for the French.  This\nlooks like the French sort.  Let me see, they are read by taking the third letter in each second\nword.\"  Francis Talbot, somewhat proud of his proficiency, and perfectly certain of the trustworthiness\nof his cousin Richard, went on puzzling out the ciphered letters, making Richard set each letter\ndown as he picked it out, and trying whether they would make sense in French or English.  Both\nunderstood French, having learned it in their page days, and kept it up by intercourse with\nthe French suite.  Francis, however, had to try two or three methods, which, being a young\nman, perhaps he was pleased to display, and at last he hit upon the right, which interpreted\nthe apparent gibberish of the scroll--excepting that the names of persons were concealed under\nsoubriquets which Francis Talbot could not always understand--but the following sentence by\nand by became clear:-- \"Quand le matelot vient des marais, un feu peut eclater dans la meute\net dans la melee\"--\"When the sailor lands from the fens, a fire might easily break out in the\ndog-kennel, and in the confusion\" (name could not be read) \"could carry off the tercel gentle.\"\n\n\"La meute,\" said Francis, \"that is their term for the home of us Talbots, and the sailor in\nthe fens is this Don John of Austria, who means, after conquering the Dutchmen, to come and\nset free this tercel gentle, as she calls herself, and play the inquisitor upon us. On my honour,\nDick, your boy has played the man in making this discovery.  Keep the young traitor fast, and\ntake down a couple of yeomen to lay hands on this same Tibbott as she calls herself.\"\n\n\"If I remember right,\" said Richard, \"she was said to be the sister or aunt to one of the grooms\nor prickers.\"\n\n\"So it was, Guy Norman, methinks.  Belike he was the very fellow to set fire to our kennel.\nYea, we must secure him.  I'll see to that, and you shall lay this scroll before my father\nmeantime, Dick.  Why, to fall on such a trail will restore his spirits, and win back her Grace\nto believe in his honesty, if my lady's tricks should have made her doubtful.\"\n\nOff went Francis with great alacrity, and ere long the Earl was present with Richard.  The\nlong light beard was now tinged with gray, and there were deep lines round the mouth and temples,\nbetraying how the long anxiety was telling on him, and rendering him suspicious and querulous.\n\"Soh!  Richard Talbot,\" was his salutation, \"what's the coil now?  Can a man never be left\nin peace in his own house, between queens and ladies, plots and follies, but his own kinsfolk\nand retainers must come to him on every petty broil among the lads!  I should have thought\nyour boy and young Babington might fight out their quarrels alone without vexing a man that\nis near driven distracted as it is.\"\n\n\"I grieve to vex your lordship,\" said Richard, standing bareheaded, \"but Master Francis thought\nthis scroll worthy of your attention. This is the manner in which he deciphered it.\"\n\n\"Scrolls, I am sick of scrolls,\" said the Earl testily.  \"What! is it some order for saying\nmass,--or to get some new Popish image or a skein of silk?  I wear my eyes out reading such\nas that, and racking my brains for some hidden meaning!\"\n\nAnd falling on Francis's first attempt at copying, he was scornful of the whole, and had nearly\nthrown the matter aside, but when he lit at last on the sentence about burning the meute and\ncarrying off the tercel gentle, his brow grew dark indeed, and his inquiries came thickly one\nupon the other, both as to Antony Babington and the huckstering woman.\n\nIn the midst, Frank Talbot returned with the tidings that the pricker Guy Norman was nowhere\nto be found.  He had last been seen by his comrades about the time that Captain Richard had\nreturned to the Manor-house.  Probably he had taken alarm on seeing him come back at that unusual\nhour, and had gone to carry the warning to his supposed aunt.  This last intelligence made\nthe Earl decide on going down at once to Bridgefield to examine young Babington before there\nwas time to miss his presence at the lodge, or to hold any communication with him.  Frank caused\nhorses to be brought round, and the Earl rode down with Richard by a shaded alley in an ordinary\ncloak and hat.\n\nMy Lord's appearance at Bridgefield was a rarer and more awful event than was my Lady's, and\nif Mistress Susan had been warned beforehand, there is no saying how at the head of her men\nand maids she would have scrubbed and polished the floors, and brushed the hangings and cushions.\nWhat then were her feelings when the rider, who dismounted from his little hackney as unpretendingly\nas did her husband in the twilight court, proved to have my Lord's long beard and narrow face!\n\nCurtseying her lowest and with a feeling of consternation and pity, as she thought of the orphan\nboy, she accepted his greeting with duteous welcome as he said, \"Kinswoman, I am come to cumber\nyou, whilst I inquire into this matter.  I give your son thanks for the honesty and faithfulness\nhe hath shown in the matter, as befitted his father's son.  I should wish myself to examine\nthe springald.\"\n\nHumfrey was accordingly called, and, privately admonished by his father that he must not allow\nany scruples about bringing his playmate into trouble to lead him to withhold his evidence,\nor shrink from telling the whole truth as he knew it, Humfrey accordingly stood before the\nEarl and made his replies a little sullenly but quite straightforwardly.  He had prevented\nthe whistle from being given to his sister for the huckstress because the woman was a witch,\nwho frightened her, and moreover he knew it was against rules.  Did he suspect that the whistle\ncame from the Queen of Scots?\n\nHe looked startled, and asked if it were so indeed, and when again commanded to say why he\nhad thought it possible, he replied that he knew Antony thought the Queen of Scots a fair and\ngracious lady.\n\nDid he believe that Antony ever had communication with her or her people unheard by others?\n\n\"Assuredly!  Wherefore not, when he carried my Lady Countess's messages?\"\n\nLord Shrewsbury bent his brow, but did not further pursue this branch of the subject, but demanded\nof Humfrey a description of Tibbott, huckster or witch, man or woman.\n\n\"She wears a big black hood and muffler,\" said Humfrey, \"and hath a long hooked stick.\"\n\n\"I asked thee not of her muffler, boy, but of her person.\"\n\n\"She hath pouncet boxes and hawks' bells, and dog-whistles in her basket,\" proceeded Humfrey,\nbut as the Earl waxed impatient, and demanded whether no one could give him a clearer account,\nRichard bade Humfrey call his mother.\n\nShe, however, could say nothing as to the woman's appearance.  She had gone to Norman's cottage\nto offer her services after the supposed accident, but had been told that the potticary of\nthe Queen of Scots had undertaken her cure, and had only seen her huddled up in a heap of rags,\nasleep.  Since her recovery the woman had been several times at Bridgefield, but it had struck\nthe mistress of the house that there was a certain avoidance of direct communication with her,\nand a preference for the servants and children.  This Susan had ascribed to fear that she should\nbe warned off for her fortune-telling propensities, or the children's little bargains interfered\nwith.  All she could answer for was that she had once seen a huge pair of grizzled eyebrows,\nwith light eyes under them, and that the woman, if woman she were, was tall, and bent a good\ndeal upon a hooked stick, which supported her limping steps.  Cicely could say little more,\nexcept that the witch had a deep awesome voice, like a man, and a long nose terrible to look\nat."}

{"ID": 1057, "text": "\n\"Is anybody there?\" Lord Creith called.\n\nThe partition dividing the cabins did not extend to the upper deck,\nand a space of three or four inches made conversation possible. It was\nthe wounded officer, they discovered. No bones were broken, he told\nthem, but he was in considerable pain.\n\n\"Have you any kind of firearm on your side?\" he asked anxiously.\n\nLord Creith had to confess sadly that he was unarmed.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" was the reply. \"Most of the crew are ashore. The\nCaptain and the first and second officers have gone to collect some\npacking-cases.\"\n\n\"How many of the crew are left on the ship?\"\n\nThere was a silence as the officer calculated, and then:\n\n\"Six, including the steward. One deckhand, two chefs and a cook's\nmate, and, of course, the Moor we took on at Southampton. He is the\nfellow who bowled me over. I think they must have got the deckhands,\nand the chef wouldn't fight. That leaves us with the cook's mate.\"\n\nHe laughed bitterly.\n\n\"And the cook's mate is going to have a bad time,\" he said after a\npause. \"He beat up the Moor a few days ago. I only heard about it in\nthe early watch. You remember your daughter complained--she is with\nyou, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lord Creith. \"Was it the Moor who opened the door?\"\n\n\"That's the man. I suppose he was looking for loose guns,\" said the\nofficer. \"The cook's mate happened to be on duty and saw the fellow,\nand there was trouble! And there's worse trouble ahead--here they\ncome.\"\n\nThere was a patter of bare feet in the alleyway, and somebody hammered\non the cabin door.\n\n\"You come out, you not be hurt, mister,\" said a husky voice.\n\nLord Creith made no reply.\n\n_Crash!_ The door shivered under the blow, but it was obvious that the\nnarrow alleyway did not give sufficient play to the hammer, for the\nlock remained intact. Again the blow fell, and a long crack appeared\nin one of the panels of the door.\n\nLord Creith looked round helplessly.\n\n\"There is no kind of weapon here,\" he said in a slow voice to the\ngirl. \"Even my wretched razor is a safety!\"\n\nHe looked at the porthole.\n\n\"Do you think you could squeeze through that?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I won't leave you, Daddy,\" she said, and he patted her shoulder.\n\n\"I don't think you could get through,\" he said, eyeing the porthole\ndubiously.\n\nCrack! Bang! The panel broke, but it was not the sound of its smashing\nthey heard. Outside in the alleyway there was a quick scurry of feet,\na shot was fired, and another. Then, from the other end of the\nalleyway came three shots in quick succession. Somebody fell heavily\nagainst the wall with a hideous howl, and then there was a momentary\nsilence.\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\nIt was the officer's voice from the next cabin.\n\n\"I think it was somebody shooting,\" said Lord Creith. He peered\nthrough the splintered panel. The man on the floor was still howling\ndismally, but there was no other sound.\n\n\"Look, Daddy,\" cried the girl excitedly. \"The boat is returning.\"\n\nShe pointed through the porthole, and over her shoulder he saw the two\nboats rowing furiously toward the yacht.\n\nAnd now the alleyway pandemonium broke out. Again came the rush of\nfeet and the deafening staccato of the automatic.\n\n\"Who is it? It must be one of the deckhands. Where did he get his\ngun?\"\n\nThe questions were fired across the top of the partition, but Lord\nCreith was too intent upon the struggle outside. The firing had\nceased, but the screaming fury of the fighters went on. Presently\nthere was an exultant yell and somebody was dragged along the\nalleyway.\n\n\"They've got him,\" said Lord Creith, a little hoarsely. \"I wonder who\nhe is.\"\n\nThen, as the leader of the mob came parallel with the door, a voice\nhailed them in English.\n\n\"Don't open your door until the crew come aboard. They are returning.\"\n\nThe girl stood petrified at the sound of the voice, and pushing her\nfather aside she stooped to peer through the broken panel. She saw a\nman struggling in the hands of his white-robed captors; a tall man in\nthe soiled white garb of a cook. It was Jim Morlake!\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\n_The Man on the Beach_\n\n\nJoan screamed and tugged at the door.\n\n\"The key, the key, Father!\" she said wildly. \"It is Jim!\"\n\nBut he dragged her back.\n\n\"My dear, you're not going to help Jim Morlake or yourself by putting\nyourself in the hands of these beasts,\" he said, and presently her\nstruggles ceased and she hung heavily in his arms.\n\nHe laid her on the settee and ran to the porthole. The boats were\nnearing the yacht, and he could see, by the attitude of the Captain,\nwho stood in the stern, revolver in hand, that news of the mutiny had\nreached him. There was no noise from the alleyway nor overhead on the\ndeck; only the whining of the wounded man outside the door broke the\ncomplete stillness. In another minute they heard the boats bump\nagainst the side of the ship, and the rattle of booted feet above\nthem. And then came the Captain's voice.\n\n\"Is anybody here?\" he called.\n\nLord Creith unlocked the cabin door and stepped out over the prostrate\nfigure.\n\n\"Thank God you're safe!\" said Captain Green fervently. \"The young\nlady, is she all right?\"\n\nJoan had recovered, and though she lay without movement she was\nconscious. Then realising that she alone knew the secret of the\n\"cook's\" identity, she staggered to her feet.\n\n\"Jim! They have taken Jim!\" she said wildly.\n\n\"Your cook.\" Lord Creith supplied the startling information.\n\n\"My cook!\" said the puzzled captain, and then a light dawned on him.\n\"You mean the assistant cook--the man I took on at Southampton? Is he\nthe fellow who did this?\" He looked down at the motionless figure in\nthe alleyway. \"If they have taken him, he is on the dhow,\" said the\nCaptain. \"It pushed off as we came on board.\"\n\nHe ran up to the deck, and the girl did her best to imitate his\nalacrity, but her limbs were shaking and she was curiously weak. The\ndhow was already a dozen yards from the ship, and was heeling over\nunder the fresh land breeze, her big leg-o'-mutton sail filling.\n\n\"Are you sure they've taken him on board?\" asked the Captain. \"He may\nbe amongst the----\" He did not finish the sentence.\n\nOne of the crew was dead, another so badly injured that his life was\ndespaired of, and search parties were sent to discover other\ncasualties, but no sign of Jim was reported.\n\n\"We can overtake them,\" said Lord Creith, and the Captain nodded.\n\n\"I'll get up anchor, but it is by no means certain we can do much\nunless they are fools enough to keep to the open sea. I think they'll\nrun round the point, and there I shan't be able to follow them, except\nwith boat crews.\"\n\nThe dhow was gaining way every minute. The white wake at her stern was\nsignificant.\n\nThe wireless operator, in his little cabin on the upper deck, had been\noverlooked by the boarders, and it was he who had signalled the\nCaptain back. He had done something more: he had got in touch with an\nAmerican destroyer that was cruising some twenty miles away, and a\nblur of smoke showed on the horizon.\n\n\"Whether she can come up before the dhow gets to safety is a\nquestion,\" said the Captain.\n\nAt that moment the white-sailed vessel changed her course, and the\nCaptain grunted.\n\n\"She is going inshore round the point. I thought she would,\" he said.\n\n\"What will they do with him?\" asked the girl, and for a moment he did\nnot know to whom she referred.\n\n\"Oh, the cook? I don't suppose he'll come to much harm. If they\nthought he was a man of substance they would hold him to ransom. As it\nis, he'll probably be fairly well treated. The Moor isn't particularly\nvindictive to the enemies he takes in fair fight.\"\n\nThe wind had freshened and was blowing strongly when the yacht's bow\nturned in pursuit of the Moorish craft, but by this time he was\nrounding the promontory that ran out to sea for two miles, and by his\ntactics the Captain guessed what plan was being followed.\n\n\"We shall never get up to them,\" he said, \"and if we do, we shan't\nfind the man we want.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Joan, but he did not supply the gruesome information.\n\nIn his days he had been a member of the Royal Navy, engaged in the\nsuppression of slave traffic on the East Coast of Africa, and he had\nseen slaves dropped overboard, with a bar of iron about their necks,\nin order that the incriminating evidence against the captors should\nbe removed. And he did not doubt that the skipper of the dhow would\nfollow the same procedure.\n\nWhen they rounded the point, the dhow was so close inshore that it\nseemed to have grounded.\n\n\"They're landing,\" said Captain Green, watching the boat through his\nglasses, \"and there goes my cook!\"\n\nThe girl almost snatched the binoculars from him and focussed them on\nthe beach. Her hand trembled so violently that all she saw was a blur\nof white figures and yellow sand, but presently she mastered her\nemotion and held the glasses upon the tall, dark form that walked\nleisurely up the beach.\n\n\"That is he,\" she whispered. \"Oh, Jim, Jim!\"\n\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Then there is no need for me to pretend ignorance,\" said the Captain,\n\"and I will ask you to keep this matter from my owners. Captain\nMorlake and I are old acquaintances. I knew him when he was at\nTangier. He came to me in a great hurry on the Friday night before we\nsailed, and begged me to ship him on board the yacht as an extra hand.\nKnowing that he has always been mixed up in queer adventures--he was\nan intelligence officer, and may be still, for all I know--I took him\non as a cook. He warned me of what would happen, and, like a fool, I\nthought he was romancing.\"\n\n\"He warned you of this attack?\" said Lord Creith in astonishment. \"How\ncould he know?\"\n\nThe Captain shook his head.\n\n\"That I can't tell you, but he did know, though I imagine he wasn't\nsure where the attempt would be made, because he said nothing before I\nwent ashore to pick up those darned packing-cases--which were not\nthere!\"\n\nThe destroyer was now visible to the naked eye.\n\n\"She is useless to us,\" said the Captain, shaking his head. \"Before\nshe can land a party, these fellows will be well away into the\ndesert.\" He bit his lip thoughtfully. \"They won't hurt Captain\nMorlake. He speaks the language, and there is hardly a big man in\nMorocco who doesn't know him. I should imagine that at this moment\nthe captain of the dhow is scared to death to find who is his\nprisoner.\"\n\nHe focussed his glasses again.\n\n\"Two Europeans!\" he gasped. \"What other man have they taken? Do you\nknow, Johnson?\" He turned to his second officer.\n\n\"I've been looking at him and I can't make him out,\" he said.\n\nHe steadied his telescope against a stanchion and looked again.\n\n\"He is certainly a European, and he is certainly not a sailor. He is\nwearing a civilian overcoat.\"\n\n\"May I look?\"\n\nAssisted by the officer, the girl brought the telescope to bear upon\nthe figure that was walking with a white-gowned Moor. Jim had\ndisappeared over the crest of a sandhill, and these two walked alone,\nthe Moor gesticulating, the other emphasising some point with his\nclenched fist.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I don't know him,\" she said. \"I never expected I would.\"\n\nIt was a humiliating confession for her to make, did she but know it,\nfor she had once boasted that she would know Ralph Hamon anywhere and\nin any garb! And it was Ralph Hamon who strode angrily side by side\nwith the master of the dhow.\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\n_The Play_\n\n\nRalph Hamon, shivering in his light suit, despite the heavy overcoat\nhe wore, growled his imprecations as he toiled painfully up the steep\nslope of the sandhill and Arabic is a language which was specially\ndesigned for cursing.\n\n\"You're a fool!\" he stormed. \"Did I not tell you a hundred times what\nto do?\"\n\nThe black-bearded captain of the dhow shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"It was the fault of my officer, who now roasts in hell, for I told\nhim first to silence all the members of the crew that were left on\nboard, but they forgot this sailor with a pistol.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you knock him on the head? Why did you bring him on\nboard?\" growled Hamon.\n\n\"Because the men desired to settle with him in their own way. He has\nkilled Yussef, whom the men loved. I think he will be sorry he did not\ndie,\" said the Captain ominously, and Ralph Hamon snorted.\n\n\"What he will be sorry for and what he will be happy about doesn't\nconcern me,\" he growled. \"You had the woman in your hands and you did\nnot take her.\"\n\n\"If this sailor with a pistol----\" began the Captain again, and Ralph\nHamon shouted him down.\n\n\"Curse the sailor with a pistol!\" he shouted. \"Do you think I've been\nlying ill in your foul boat for two days in order to capture a\nsailor?\"\n\n\"If you will see him----\" pleaded the Moor.\n\n\"I don't want to see him, and I don't want him to see me. If you\nallowed the woman to escape, you are fools enough to let him go also.\nAnd do you think I want him to carry the news to Tangier that I was\nwith you on your dhow? Do what you like with him.\"\n\nHe saw the prisoner at a distance--a tall man whose face was\nunrecognisable under the mask of grime and blood, but he did not\nventure near to him. Mules were waiting for them at a little village\nand at the sight of one, more richly caparisoned than the rest, with a\nsaddle of soft red leather, and tinkling bells about its neck, Ralph\nHamon bit his lip until the blood came. It was the palfrey that he had\ndesigned for the girl.\n\nWith no delay the party mounted and soon a string of a dozen mules was\ncrossing the wild land. They halted for two hours in the afternoon and\nresumed the journey, halting for the night in the vicinity of a little\nvillage of charcoal burners.\n\n\"You will not come to the play?\" said the Captain interrogatively.\n\"This man is of your race and it would give you unhappiness to see\nthem whip him.\"\n\n\"It would not make me unhappy at all,\" said Ralph savagely, \"but I'm\ntired.\"\n\nThey pitched a tent for him next to the chief, and he was on the point\nof retiring, though the sun had scarcely touched the western horizon,\nwhen a diversion came. There was an excited stir amongst the men of\nthe caravan; the drone of conversation rose to a higher pitch and he\nenquired the cause.\n\n\"El Zafouri,\" was the laconic answer.\n\nRalph knew the name of this insurgent chief, though he had never met\nhim.\n\n\"Is he here?\"\n\n\"He is coming,\" said the other indifferently, \"but I am a good friend\nof his and there is nothing to fear.\"\n\nA cloud of dust on the hill-road was evidence of the size and\nimportance of El Zafouri's retinue; and when, half-an-hour later, he\npitched his camp near by, Ralph Hamon was glad in his heart that the\nrebel was likely to prove a friend.\n\nHe went in person to greet the notorious shereef, and found him\nsitting before his tent, a squat and burly man, distinctly negroid of\ncountenance, and black.\n\n\"Peace on your house, Zafouri!\" he said conventionally.\n\n\"And on you peace,\" said Zafouri, looking up straightly at the\nstranger. \"I think I know you. You are Hamon.\"\n\n\"That is my name,\" said Ralph, gratified that his fame had extended so\nfar.\n\n\"You are a friend of the Shereef Sadi Hafiz?\"\n\nHere Ralph Hamon was on more delicate ground. So rapidly did Sadi\nchange his friendships and his allegiances that, for all he knew, he\nmight at the moment be a deadly enemy of the man who was watching him.\n\n\"Sadi is my agent,\" he said carefully, \"but who knows whether he is my\nman now? For Sadi is a man who serves the sun that shines.\"\n\nHe was perfectly safe in saying this, for the reputation of Sadi Hafiz\nwas common property and he was secretly relieved to see the twinkle\nthat came in Zafouri's dark eyes.\n\n\"That is true,\" he said. \"Where are you going, _haj_?\" He addressed\nthe captain of the dhow, who had stood by Ralph during the interview.\n\n\"To the Rifi Hills, Shereef,\" he said and the little Moor stroked his\nchin.\n\n\"You are coming the longest way,\" he said significantly. \"You have a\nprisoner?\"\n\nThe dhow captain nodded.\n\n\"My men told me of him. He dies, they say? Well, that is best for him\nand for all. When a man is asleep he harms nobody and is happy. I will\ncome to your play.\"\n\nRalph would have been present, but nature forbade the exertion. For\nforty-eight hours he had been without sleep, and no sooner had he lain\non the matting that his servant had spread for him in the tent, than\nhe was asleep.\n\nThe play had been fixed for an hour after sunset, and it was of a kind\nthat was novel to Zafouri. Two lines of men arranged themselves at a\nfew paces' interval, leaving a narrow lane through which the prisoner\nwas to pass, ostensibly to safety, for, if he reached the end of the\nlane and was sufficiently agile to escape the two swordsmen placed\nthere to give him his quietus, he was free. It was the old, bad\npunishment of running the gauntlet, and Jim, who in his experience had\nheard of this method of settling accounts with malefactors and\npolitical enemies, faced the certainty that, swift as he might run, he\ncould not hope to survive the hail of blows which would fall on him,\nfor each man in the two lines was armed with a wooden stave.\n\nHis captors brought him fruit and water.\n\n\"Be swift and you will be happy,\" said one with a chuckle, and was\ntaken aback when Jim answered in the Moorish Arabic quoting a familiar\ntag.\n\n\"Justice is faster than birds and more terrible than lions.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said his gaoler in surprise. \"You speak the language of God!\nNow, friend, speak well for me to the djinn, for to-night you will\nlive amongst ghosts!\"\n\nThey brought him out for the final condemnation and the dhow captain,\nsquatting in state on a silken carpet, gave judgment.\n\n\"Death for Death. Who kills shall be killed,\" he recited in a\nmonotonous sing-song.\n\n\"Remember that, man,\" said Jim sternly, and Zafouri, who shared the\nsilken carpet with his host, shot a quick glance at the bearded\nprisoner.\n\nThey brought the Captain a glass of water and he ceremoniously washed\nhis hands of the prisoner.\n\n\"Listen, man without a name,\" said Jim in fluent Arabic. \"If I die,\npeople will talk and the consequence will come to you wherever you\nare, and you will hand in the _sok_, and your soul will go down to\nGehenna and meet my soul----\"\n\n\"Take him away,\" said the Captain huskily.\n\n\"Let him stay.\"\n\nIt was Zafouri who spoke.\n\n\"Peace on you, Milaka.\" It was the old Moorish name for him and Jim's\neyes kindled.\n\n\"And on you peace, Zafouri,\" said Jim, recognising the man.\n\nAnd then Zafouri drew his squat bulk erect, and, putting his arms\nabout the prisoner, kissed him on the shoulder.\n\n\"If any man says death to my friend, let him say it now,\" he said, and\nhis left hand closed over the hilt of his curved sword.\n\nThe Captain did not speak.\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\n_The Courtyard_\n\n\nTangier lay bathed in the early morning sunlight, a vast mosaic of\nwhite and green, and Joan Carston gazed spellbound at the beauty of\nthe city as the yacht moved slowly into the bay. Overhead was a\ncloudless blue sky; and a shore wind brought in its lap a faint,\npungent and yet indescribable aroma.\n\n\"That is the East,\" sniffed Lord Creith.\n\nJoan had thrown off the effects of her terrible experience, but the\nchange which Lord Creith had noticed in her before they had left\nEngland was more marked than ever.\n\n\"Do you feel equal to going ashore?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"You're a wonderful girl, Joan,\" he said admiringly. \"You have had\nmore knock-down blows in the past few weeks than come to most people\nin the course of their lives.\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"You can become inured even to knock-down blows. I think it would take\na human earthquake to disturb me now.\"\n\nHe shot a furtive glance in her direction.\n\n\"You're not worrying any more about--about Morlake?\"\n\nShe seemed to be examining her own mind before she replied.\n\n\"It is difficult to tell how I feel. I have such faith in him and this\nfeeling--that if anything terrible had happened I should know.\"\n\nLord Creith was only too happy to agree. He had a weakness for\nagreeing to all cheerful, and for dissenting violently from all\ndismal, predictions.\n\n\"The Captain says he has arranged to stay here a week and I think we\ncan well afford the time.\"\n\nHe had booked rooms at the big white hotel that overlooked the beach\nand, later in the day, from the broad terrace, she could gaze in\nwonder at the confused jumble of buildings, which made modern Tangier.\n\n\"Rather like the Old Testament lit by electricity,\" said his lordship.\n\"I don't know whether I've read that or whether I've invented it. If\nI've invented it, it is jolly good. I hope you're not being\ndisappointed, Joan. These Eastern cities are never quite so pleasant\nnear at hand as they are from three miles out at sea. And the\nsmell--phew!\" He dabbed his nose with his handkerchief and pulled an\nunpleasant face.\n\n\"Jim lived here for years,\" she said.\n\n\"Even that doesn't make it smell like Attar of Roses,\" said her\npractical father. \"What was he doing here?\"\n\n\"Captain Green says he was in the diplomatic service. I am going to\nenquire.\"\n\nThe next day she threaded the tortuous street in which the various\nconsulates were situated. The news she secured about Jim Morlake was,\nhowever, of the most fragmentary character. By very reason of his\nprofession, the officials at the consulates and embassies were\nreticent. She was, however, able to confirm the Captain's statement,\nwhich had been news to her, that for some years Jim Morlake had been\nsomething of a power in this city. Lord Creith knew the British\nMinister and they went to tea at the Residency and Joan listened\nwithout hearing to the talk of concessions, of representations, of the\nenormities of the sanitary council and the hideous injustice which was\ninflicted by the native _basha_ upon the unfortunate subjects of the\nSultan.\n\nShe did not accompany her father in his visit to the prison and she\nwas glad afterwards, when he brought back a highly coloured narrative\nof his experience.\n\n\"A hell upon earth,\" he described it tersely, and she felt a little\nsinking of heart. If the method of the _Kasbah_ was the standard of\nthe Moorish treatment of prisoners, then it would go hard with Jim.\n\nIt was the third day of their visit and already Joan had almost\nwearied of the town. She had seen the great marketplace, and wandered\namidst the charcoal sellers and the kneeling camels, had watched the\nnative jugglers and the professional holy men, and chaffered with the\nsellers of brass in the bazaar.\n\n\"The prettiest part of Tangier one doesn't see. Do you remember that\nugly street we passed through at the back of the mosque?\" she asked.\n\"A very old door opened and I caught a glimpse of the most gorgeous\ngarden and there were two veiled women on a balcony, feeding the\npigeons. It was so lovely a picture that I nearly went in.\"\n\nLord Creith said something about the insanitary conditions of the\nhouses and went on to discuss the hotel bill. That afternoon, they\nwalked up the hill to see a gun play. A number of tribesmen had come\nin from the hills to celebrate the anniversary of a local saint's\ndeath and at her request he turned aside from the market place to show\nher the exterior of the prison.\n\nShe shuddered as a horrible face leered out at her from behind the\nbars.\n\n\"Do you want to have a look inside?\"\n\n\"No thank you, Daddy,\" she said hastily, and they turned their steps\ntoward the bazaar.\n\nLord Creith opened his lawn umbrella and put it up, for the sun's rays\nwere unpleasantly hot.\n\n\"East is East and West is West,\" he chanted. \"What always interests me\nabout these fellows is, what are they thinking about? You don't really\nget into the East until you understand its psychology.\"\n\nThe girl, who had been walking behind him, did not answer, but he was\nused to that.\n\n\"Now, if you were to ask me----\" he began and turned his head to\nemphasise his remarks.\n\nJoan was not there!\n\nHe strode back along the street. A begging man stood at the corner of\na court, demanding alms in the name of Allah; a stout veiled woman was\nwaddling away from him carrying a basket of native work; but there was\nno sign of Joan. He looked up at the high walls on either side, as\nthough he expected to find her perched miraculously on the top.\n\nAnd then the seriousness of possibilities struck him and he ran along\nthe uneven cobbled street to the end. He looked left and right, but\nthere was no sign of Joan. In one street he saw four men carrying a\nwooden case, chanting as they went, and he came back to the beggar and\nwas about to ask him if he had seen a lady, when he saw that the man\nhad been blinded.\n\n\"Joan!\" he roared.\n\nThere was no answer. A man who was asleep in the shadow of a doorway\nwoke with a start, stared at the pallid old man, then, cursing all\nforeigners who disturb the rest of the faithful, curled up and went to\nsleep again.\n\nLord Creith saw in the distance a French officer of gendarmes and ran\nup to him.\n\n\"Have you seen a European lady--my daughter----?\" he began\nincoherently.\n\nRapidly he told the story of the girl's disappearance.\n\n\"Probably she has gone into one of the houses. Have you any Moorish\nfriends?\" asked the officer.\n\n\"None,\" said Lord Creith emphatically.\n\n\"Where was she when you saw her last?\" and Lord Creith pointed.\n\n\"There is a short cut to the _sok_ near here,\" suggested the officer\nand led the way.\n\nBut Joan was not in the big market place and Lord Creith hurried back\nto the hotel. The lady had not returned, the manager told him. She was\nnot on the terrace. The only person on the terrace was a tall man in\ngrey, who was fanning himself gently with his broad-brimmed sombrero.\n\nHe looked round at the sound of Lord Creith's voice and jumping to his\nfeet, hurried toward him.\n\n\"Morlake!\" gasped Creith. \"Joan...!\"\n\n\"What has happened to her?\" asked Jim quickly.\n\n\"She has disappeared! My God, I'm afraid--I'm afraid!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\n_The House of Sadi_\n\n\nJim had a brief consultation with the chief of police before Lord\nCreith guided him to the spot where Joan had disappeared.\n\n\"I thought it was here!\"\n\nHe said something in a low voice to the police chief and Lord Creith\nsaw the officer shake his head and heard him say:"}
{"ID": 519, "text": "Come on now, and keep close, for it's easy to get lost in these sand hills.\"\n\nKeith had ridden that hundred and fifty miles of sandy desolation before, but had never been\ncalled upon to make such a journey as this proved to be. He knew there was little to fear from\nhuman enemies, for they were riding far enough east of the Santa F\u00e9 trail to be out of the\npath of raiding parties, while this desert country was shunned by Indian hunters. It consisted\nof sand hill after sand hill, a drear waterless waste where nothing grew, and amid the dread\nsameness of which a traveller could only find passage by the guidance of stars at night or\nthe blazing sun by day. To the eye mile after mile appeared exactly alike, with nothing whatever\nto distinguish either distance or direction--the same drifting ridges of sand stretching forth\nin every direction, no summit higher than another, no semblance of green shrubbery, or silver\nsheen of running water anywhere to break the dull monotony--a vast sandy plain, devoid of life,\nextending to the horizon, overhung by a barren sky.\n\nThey had covered ten miles of it by daybreak, their ponies travelling heavily, fetlock deep,\nbut could advance no further. With the first tint of rose in the east the brooding storm burst\nupon them in wild desert fury, the fierce wind buffeting them back, lashing their faces with\nsharp grit until they were unable to bear the pain. The flying sand smote them in clouds, driven\nwith the speed of bullets. In vain they lay flat, urging their ponies forward; the beasts,\nmaddened and blinded by the merciless lashing of the sand, refused to face the storm. Keith,\nall sense of direction long since lost, rolled wearily from the saddle, burrowed under the\npartial shelter of a sand dune, and called upon Neb to follow him. With their hands and feet\nthey made a slight wind-break, dragging the struggling ponies into its protection, and burrowed\nthemselves there, the clouds of sand skurrying over them so thick as to obscure the sky, and\nrapidly burying them altogether as though in a grave. Within an hour they were compelled to\ndig themselves out, yet it proved partial escape from the pitiless lashing. The wind howled\nlike unloosed demons, and the air grew cold, adding to the sting of the grit, when some sudden\neddy hurled it into their hiding place. To endeavor further travel would mean certain death,\nfor no one could have guided a course for a hundred feet through the tempest, which seemed\nto suck the very breath away. To the fugitives came this comfort--if they could not advance,\nthen no one else could follow, and the storm was completely blotting out their trail.\n\nIt was three o'clock before it died sufficiently down for them to venture out. Even then the\nair remained full of sand, while constantly shifting ridges made travel difficult. Only grim\nnecessity--the suffering of the ponies for water, and their own need for soon reaching the\nhabitation of man and acquiring food--drove them to the early venture. They must attain the\nvalley of the Salt Fork that night, or else perish in the desert-- there remained no other\nchoice. Tying neckerchiefs over their horses' eyes, and lying flat themselves, they succeeded\nin pressing slowly forward, winding in and out among the shifting dunes, with only the wind\nto guide them. It was an awful trail, the hoofs sinking deep in drifting sand, the struggling\nponies becoming so exhausted that their riders finally dismounted, and staggered forward on\nfoot, leading them stumbling blindly after. Once the negro's horse dropped, and had to be lashed\nto its feet again; once Keith's pony stumbled and fell on him, hurling him face down into the\nsand, and he would have died there, lacking sufficient strength to lift the dead weight, but\nfor Neb's assistance. As it was he went staggering blindly forward, bruised, and faint from\nhunger and fatigue. Neither man spoke; they had no breath nor energy left to waste; every ounce\nof strength needed to be conserved for the battle against nature. They were fighting for life;\nfighting grimly, almost hopelessly, and alone.\n\nAbout them night finally closed in, black and starless, yet fortunately with a gradual dying\naway of the storm. For an hour past they had been struggling on, doubting their direction,\nwondering dully if they were not lost and merely drifting about in a circle. They had debated\nthis fiercely once, the ponies standing dejectedly, tails to the storm, Neb arguing that the\nwind still blew from the south, and Keith contending it had shifted into the westward. The\nwhite man won his way, and they staggered on uncertain, the negro grasping the first pony's\ntail to keep from being separated from his companion. Some instinct of the plains must have\nguided them, for at last they dragged themselves out from the desert, the crunching sand under\nfoot changing into rock, and then to short brittle grass, at which the ponies nibbled eagerly.\nThe slope led gradually downward, the animals scenting water, and struggling to break away.\nSwaying in their saddles, the riders let them go, and they never stopped until belly deep in\nthe stream, their noses buried. The men shivered in their saddles, until, at last satisfied,\nthe ponies consented to be forced back up the bank, where they nibbled at the short tufts of\nherbage, but in a manner expressive of weariness. Keith flung himself on the ground, every\nmuscle of his body aching, his exposed flesh still smarting from the hail of sand through which\nthey had passed.\n\nHe had not the slightest conception as to where they were, except he knew this must be the\nSalt Fork. Utterly confused by the maze of shifting dunes, through whose intricacies they had\nsomehow found passage, the blackness of the night yielded no clue as to their point of emergence.\nThe volume of water in the stream alone suggested that in their wanderings they must have drifted\nto the eastward, and come out much lower down than had been originally intended. If so, then\nthey might be almost directly south of Carson City, and in a section with which he was totally\nunacquainted. One thing was, however, certain--they would be compelled to wait for daylight\nto ascertain the truth, and decide upon their future movements. There was another barren, sandy\nstretch of desolation lying between this isolated valley and that of the Canadian, and their\nhorses would never stand to be pushed forward without both rest and food. As to themselves--they\nhad eaten their last crumb long since, but this was not the first time both had known starvation.\n\nKeith arose reluctantly, and removed the saddles from the animals, hobbling them so they could\ngraze at will. Neb was propped up beneath an out-cropping of the bank, which partly protected\nhim from the wind, a mere hulk of a shadow. Keith could not tell whether he slept or not, but\nmade no effort to disturb him. A moment he stared vacantly about into the black silence, and\nthen lay down, pillowing his head upon a saddle. He found it impossible to sleep, the chill\nof the wind causing him to turn and twist, in vain search after comfort, while unappeased hunger\ngnawed incessantly. His eyes ranged about over the dull gloom of the skies until they fell\nagain to the earth level, and then he suddenly sat up, half believing himself in a dream--down\nthe stream, how far away he could not judge, there gleamed a steady, yellowish light. It was\nno flicker of a camp fire, yet remained stationary. Surely no star could be so low and large;\nnor did he recall any with that peculiarity of color. If such a miracle was possible in the\nheart of that sandy desert he would have sworn it was a lamp shining through a window. But\nhe had never heard of any settler on the Salt Fork, and almost laughed at the thought, believing\nfor the instant his brain played him some elfish trick. Yet that light was no illusion; he\nrubbed his eyes, only to see it more clearly, convinced now of its reality. He strode hastily\nacross, and shook Neb into semi- consciousness, dragging him bodily up the bank and pointing\ndown stream.\n\n\"Do you see that?\" he inquired anxiously. \"There, straight ahead of you?\"\n\nThe negro stared, shaking with cold, and scarcely able to stand alone.\n\n\"Maybe it am de moon, Massa Jack,\" he muttered thickly, \"or a goblin's lantern. Lawd, I don't\njest like de looks ob dat ting.\"\n\n\"Well, I do,\" and Keith laughed uneasily at the negro's fears. \"All I wanted to know was if\nyou saw what I saw. That's a lamp shining through a window, Neb. What in heaven's name it can\nbe doing here I am unable to guess, but I'm going to find out. It means shelter and food, boy,\neven if we have to fight for it. Come on, the horses are safe, and we'll discover what is behind\nthat light yonder.\"\n\nChapter VIII\n\nThe Wilderness Cabin\n\nThe light was considerably farther away than they had at first supposed, and as they advanced\nsteadily toward it, the nature of the ground rapidly changed, becoming irregular, and littered\nwith low growing shrubs. In the darkness they stumbled over outcroppings of rock, and after\na fall or two, were compelled to move forward with extreme caution. But the mysterious yellow\nglow continually beckoned, and with new hope animating the hearts of both men, they staggered\non, nerving themselves to the effort, and following closely along the bank of the stream.\n\nAt last they arrived where they could perceive dimly something of the nature of this unexpected\ndesert oasis.\n\nThe light shone forth, piercing the night, through the uncurtained window of a log cabin, which\nwould otherwise have been completely concealed from view by a group of low growing cottonwoods.\nThis was all the black, enshrouding night revealed, and even this was merely made apparent\nby the yellow illumination of the window. The cabin stood upon an island, a strip of sand,\npartially covered by water, separating it from the north shore on which they stood. There was\nno sign of life about the hut, other than the burning lamp, but that alone was sufficient evidence\nof occupancy. In spite of hunger, and urgent need, Keith hesitated, uncertain as to what they\nmight be called upon to face. Who could be living in this out-of-the- way spot, in the heart\nof this inhospitable desert? It would be no cattle outpost surely, for there was no surrounding\ngrazing land, while surely no professional hunter would choose such a barren spot for headquarters.\nEither a hermit, anxious to escape all intercourse with humanity, or some outlaw hiding from\narrest, would be likely to select so isolated a place in which to live. To them it would be\nideal. Away from all trails, where not even widely roving cattlemen would penetrate, in midst\nof a desert avoided by Indians because of lack of game,--a man might hide here year after year\nwithout danger of discovery. Yet such a one would not be likely to welcome their coming, and\nthey were without arms. But Keith was not a man to hesitate long because of possible danger,\nand he stepped down into the shallow water.\n\n\"Come on, Neb,\" he commanded, \"and we 'll find out who lives here.\"\n\nThe window faced the west, and he came up the low bank to where the door fronted the north\nin intense darkness. Under the shadow of the cottonwoods he could see nothing, groping his\nway, with hands extended. His foot struck a flat stone, and he plunged forward, striking the\nunlatched door so heavily as to swing it open, and fell partially forward into the room. As\nhe struggled to his knees, Neb's black face peering past him into the lighted interior, he\nseemed to perceive in one swift, comprehensive glance, every revealed detail. A lamp burned\non a rudely constructed set of drawers near the window, and a wood fire blazed redly in a stone\nfireplace opposite, the yellow and red lights blending in a peculiar glow of color. Under this\nradiance were revealed the rough log walls, plastered with yellow clay, and hung about with\nthe skins of wild animals, a roughly made table, bare except for a book lying upon it, and\na few ordinary appearing boxes, evidently utilized as seats, together with a barrel cut so\nas to make a comfortable chair. In the back wall was a door, partially open, apparently leading\ninto a second room. That was all, except the woman.\n\nKeith must have perceived all these in that first hurried glance, for they were ever after\nclosely associated together in his mind, yet at the moment he possessed no clear thought of\nanything except her. She stood directly behind the table, where she must have sprung hastily\nat the first sound of their approach, clutching at the rude mantel above the fireplace, and\nstaring toward him, her face white, her breath coming in sobs. At first he thought the vision\na dream, a delirium born from his long struggle; he could not conceive the possibility of such\na presence in this lonely place, and staggering to his feet, gazed wildly, dumbly at the slender,\ngray clad figure, the almost girlish face under the shadowing dark hair, expecting the marvellous\nvision to vanish. Surely this could not be real! A woman, and such a woman as this here, and\nalone, of all places! He staggered from weakness, almost terror, and grasped the table to hold\nhimself erect. The rising wind came swirling in through the open door, causing the fire to\nsend forth spirals of smoke, and he turned, dragging the dazed negro within, and snapping the\nlatch behind him. When he glanced around again he fully believed the vision confronting him\nwould have vanished. But no! there she yet remained, those wide-open, frightened brown eyes,\nwith long lashes half hiding their depths, looking directly into his own; only now she had\nslightly changed her posture, leaning toward him across the table. Like a flash he comprehended\nthat this was reality--flesh and blood--and, with the swift instinct of a gentleman, his numbed,\nnerveless fingers jerked off his hat, and he bowed bareheaded before her.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" he said, finding his voice with difficulty. \"I fell over the step, but--but I\ndidn't expect to find a woman here.\"\n\nHe heard her quick breathing, marked a slight change in the expression of the dark eyes, and\ncaught the glitter of the firelight on a revolver in her lowered hand.\n\n\"What did you expect to find?\"\n\n\"I hardly knew,\" he explained lamely; \"we stumbled on this hut by accident. I didn't know there\nwas a cabin in all this valley.\"\n\n\"Then you are not here for any purpose? to meet with any one?\"\n\n\"No; we were lost, and had gone into camp up above, when we discovered your light.\"\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\nKeith hesitated just an instant, yet falsehood was never easy for him, and he saw no occasion\nfor any deceit now.\n\n\"Carson City.\"\n\n\"What brought you here?\"\n\n\"We started for the 'Bar X' Ranch down below, on the Canadian; got caught in a sand-storm,\nand then just drifted. I do not know within twenty miles of where we are.\"\n\nShe drew a deep breath of unconcealed relief.\n\n\"Are you alone?\"\n\n\"The negro and I--yes; and you haven't the slightest reason to be afraid of us--we're square.\"\n\nShe looked at him searchingly, and something in Keith's clean-cut face seemed to bring reassurance,\nconfidence in the man.\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" she answered, coming toward him around the short table. \"Only it is so lonely\nhere, and you startled me, bursting in without warning. But you look all right, and I am going\nto believe your story. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Keith--Jack Keith.\"\n\n\"A cowman?\"\n\n\"A little of everything, I reckon,\" a touch of returning bitterness in the tone. \"A plainsman,\nwho has punched cattle, but my last job was government scout.\"\n\n\"You look as though you might be more than that,\" she said slowly.\n\nThe man flushed, his lips pressing tightly together. \"Well, I--I may have been,\" he confessed\nunwillingly. \"I started out all right, but somehow I reckon I just went adrift. It's a habit\nin this country.\"\n\nApparently those first words of comment had left her lips unthinkingly, for she made no attempt\nto reply; merely stood there directly facing him, her clear eyes gazing frankly into his own.\nHe seemed to actually see her now for the first time, fairly--a supple, slender figure, simply\ndressed, with wonderfully excessive brown eyes, a perfect wealth of dark hair, a clear complexion\nwith slight olive tinge to it, a strong, intelligent face, not strictly beautiful, yet strangely\nattractive, the forehead low and broad, the nose straight, the lips full and inclined to smile.\nSuddenly a vague remembrance brought recognition.\n\n\"Why, I know you now.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" the single word a note of undisguised surprise.\n\n\"Yes; I thought you looked oddly familiar all the time, but couldn't for the life of me connect\nup. You're Christie Maclaire.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" her eyes filled with curiosity.\n\n\"Of course you are. You needn't be afraid of me if you want it kept secret, but I know you\njust the same. Saw you at the 'Gaiety' in Independence, maybe two months ago. I went three\ntimes, mostly on your account. You've got a great act, and you can sing too.\"\n\nShe stood in silence, still looking fixedly at him, her bosom rising and falling, her lips\nparted as if to speak. Apparently she did not know what to do, how to act, and was thinking\nswiftly.\n\n\"Mr. Keith,\" she said, at last in decision, \"I am going to ask you to blot that all out--to\nforget that you even suspect me of being Christie Maclaire, of the Gaiety.\"\n\n\"Why, certainly; but would you explain?\"\n\n\"There is little enough to explain. It is sufficient that I am here alone with you. Whether\nI wish to or not, I am compelled to trust myself to your protection. You may call me Christie\nMaclaire, or anything else you please; you may even think me unworthy respect, but you possess\nthe face of a gentleman, and as such I am going to trust you--I must trust you. Will you accept\nmy confidence on these terms?\"\n\nKeith did not smile, nor move. Weak from hunger and fatigue, he leaned wearily against the\nwall. Nevertheless that simple, womanly appeal awoke all that was strong and sacrificing within\nhim, although her words were so unexpected that, for the moment, he failed to realize their\nfull purport. Finally he straightened up.\n\n\"I--I accept any terms you desire,\" he gasped weakly, \"if--if you will only give one return.\"\n\n\"One return?--what?\"\n\n\"Food; we have eaten nothing for sixty hours.\" Her face, which had been so white, flushed to\nthe hair, her dark eyes softening.\n\n\"Why, of course; sit down. I ought to have known from your face. There is plenty here--such\nas it is--only you must wait a moment.\"\n\nChapter IX\n\nThe Girl of the Cabin\n\nHe saw Neb drop down before the blazing fireplace, and curl up like a tired dog, and observed\nher take the lamp, open the door into the other room a trifle, and slip silently out of sight.\nHe remembered staring vaguely about the little room, still illumined by the flames, only half\ncomprehending, and then the reaction from his desperate struggle with the elements overcame\nall resolution, and he dropped his head forward on the table, and lost consciousness. Her hand\nupon his shoulder aroused him, startled into wakefulness, yet he scarcely realized the situation.\n\n\"I have placed food for the negro beside him,\" she said quietly, and for the first time Keith\ndetected the soft blur in her speech.\n\n\"You are from the South!\" he exclaimed, as though it was a discovery.\n\n\"Yes--and you?\"\n\n\"My boyhood began in Virginia--the negro was an old-time slave in our family.\"\n\nShe glanced across at the black, now sitting up and eating voraciously.\n\n\"I thought he had once been a slave; one can easily tell that. I did not ask him to sit here\nbecause, if you do not object, we will eat here together. I have also been almost as long without\nfood. It was so lonely here, and--and I hardly understood my situation--and I simply could\nnot force myself to eat.\"\n\nHe distinguished her words clearly enough, although she spoke low, as if she preferred what\nwas said between them should not reach the ears of the negro, yet somehow, for the moment,\nthey made no adequate impression on him. Like a famished wolf he began on the coarse fare,\nand for ten minutes hardly lifted his head. Then his eyes chanced to meet hers across the narrow\ntable, and instantly the gentleman within him reawoke to life.\n\n\"I have been a perfect brute,\" he acknowledged frankly, \"with no thought except for myself.\nHunger was my master, and I ask your forgiveness, Miss Maclaire.\"\n\nHer eyes smiled.\n\n\"I am so very glad to have any one here--any one--in whom I feel even a little confidence--that\nnothing else greatly matters. Can you both eat, and listen?\"\n\nKeith nodded, his eyes full of interest, searching her face.\n\n\"Whoever I may be, Mr. Keith, and really that seems only of small importance, I came to Fort\nLarned seeking some trace of my only brother, whom we last heard from there, where he had fallen\ninto evil companionship. On the stage trip I was fortunate enough to form an acquaintance with\na man who told me he knew where I could meet Fred, but that the boy was hiding because of some\ntrouble he had lately gotten into, and that I should have to proceed very carefully so as not\nto lead the officers to discover his whereabouts. This gentleman was engaged in some business\nat Carson City, but he employed a man to bring me to this place, and promised to get Fred,\nand meet me here the following day. There must have been some failure in the plans, for I have\nbeen here entirely alone now for three days. It has been very lonesome, and--and I've been\na little frightened. Perhaps I ought not to have come, and I am not certain what kind of a\nplace this is. I was so afraid when you came, but I am not afraid now.\"\n\n\"You have no need to be,\" he said soberly, impressed by the innocent candor of the girl, and\nfeeling thankful that he was present to aid her. \"I could not wrong one of the South.\"\n\n\"My father always told me I could trust a Southern gentleman under any circumstance. Mr. Hawley\nwas from my own State, and knew many of our old friends. That was why I felt such unusual confidence\nin him, although he was but a travelling acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hawley?\"\n\n\"The gentleman whom I met on the stage.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; you said he was in business in Carson City, but I don't seem to remember any one\nof that name.\"\n\n\"He was not there permanently; only to complete some business deal.\"\n\n\"And your brother? I may possibly have known him.\"\n\nShe hesitated an instant, her eyes dropping, until completely shaded by the long lashes.\n\n\"He--he was rather a wild boy, and ran away from home to enlist in the army. But he got into\na bad set, and--and deserted. That was part of the trouble which caused him to hide. He enlisted\nunder the name of Fred Willoughby. Mr. Hawley told me this much, but I am afraid he did not\ntell me all.\"\n\n\"And he said you would meet him here?\"\n\nKeith gazed about on the bare surroundings wonderingly. What was this place, hidden away in\nthe midst of the desert, isolated in a spot where not even Indians roamed. Could it be a secret\nrendezvous of crime, the headquarters of desperadoes, of cattle-rustlers, of highwaymen of\nthe Santa F\u00e9 Trail--a point to which they could ride when hard pressed, certain of hiding here\nin safety? He began to suspect this, but, if so, who then was this Hawley, and with what object\nhad he sent this girl here? Every way he turned was to confront mystery, to face a new puzzle.\nWhatever she might be--even the music hall singer he believed--she had been inveigled here\ninnocently enough. Even now she possessed only the most vague suspicion that she had been deceived.\nThe centre of the whole plot, if there was a plot, must be Hawley.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"he said that this was one of the stations of a big ranch on which Fred\nwas employed, and that he would certainly be here within a day or two.\"\n\n\"You met Hawley on the stage coach? How did you become acquainted?\"\n\n\"We were alone for nearly fifty miles,\" her voice faltering slightly, \"and--and he called me\nwhat you did.\"\n\n\"Christie Maclaire?\"\n\n\"Yes; he--he seemed to think he knew me, and I needed help so much that I let him believe so.\nI thought it could do no harm, and then, when I found he actually knew Fred, I didn't think\nof anything else, only how fortunate I was to thus meet him. Surely something serious must\nhave happened, or he would have been here before this. Do you--do you suppose there is anything\nwrong?\"\n\nKeith did not smile nor change posture. The more he delved into the matter, the more serious\nhe felt the situation to be. He knew all those ranches lying south on the Canadian, and was\naware that this was no out- station. No cattle ever came across that sandy desert unless driven\nby rustlers, and no honest purpose could account for this isolated hut. There had been frequent\nrobberies along the trail, and he had overheard tales of mysterious disappearances in both\nLarned and Carson City. Could it be that he had now, accidentally, stumbled upon the rendezvous\nof the gang? He was not a man easily startled, but this thought sent his heart beating. He\nknew enough to realize what such a gang would naturally consist of-- deserters, outlaws, rustlers;\nboth Indians and whites, no doubt, combined under some desperate leadership. Gazing into the\ngirl's questioning eyes he could scarcely refrain from blurting out all he suspected. Yet why\nshould he? What good could it do? He could not hope to bear her south to the \"Bar X\" Ranch,\nfor the ponies were already too thoroughly exhausted for such a journey; he dared not turn\nnorth with her, for that would mean his own arrest, leaving her in worse condition than ever.\nIf he only knew who this man Hawley was, his purpose, and plans! Yet what protection could\nhe and Neb prove, alone here, and without arms? All this flashed through his mind in an instant,\nleaving him confused and uncertain.\n\n\"I hope not,\" he managed to say in answer to her query. \"But it is rather a strange mix-up\nall around, and I confess I fail to comprehend its full meaning. It is hardly likely your friends\nwill show up to-night, and by morning perhaps we can decide what is best to do. Let me look\naround outside a moment.\"\n\nHer eyes followed him as he stepped through the door into the darkness; then her head dropped\ninto the support of her hands. There was silence except for the crackling of the fire, until\nNeb moved uneasily. At the sound the girl looked up, seeing clearly the good-natured face of\nthe negro.\n\n\"Yo' don't nebber need cry, Missus,\" he said soberly, \"so long as Massa Jack done 'greed to\nlook after yo'.\"\n\n\"Have--have you known him long?\"\n\n\"Has I knowed him long, honey? Ebber sence befo' de wah. Why I done knowed Massa Jack when\nhe wan't more'n dat high. Lawd, he sho' was a lively youngster, but mighty good hearted to\nus niggers.\"\n\nShe hesitated to question a servant, and yet felt she must uncover the truth.\n\n\"Who is he? Is he all he claims to be--a Virginia gentleman?\""}
{"ID": 365, "text": "Carpenter advances,\nby main trench and by side trenches, steadily to word of command.\n\nI mention, as another trait of the poor devil of an August, full of good-humor after all, That\nhe and his Royalties and big Lordships having dined, he gave the still groaning table with\nall its dishes, to be scrambled for by \"the janizaries.\" Janizaries, Imitation-Turk valetaille;\nwho speedily made clearance,--many a bit of precious Meissen porcelain going far down in society\nby that means.\n\nRoyal dinner done, the Colonel and Officers of every regiment, ranked in high order, with weapons\ndrawn, preceded by their respective bands of music, came marching up the Hill to pay their\nparticular respects to the Majesty of Prussia. Majesty of Prussia promised them his favor,\neverlasting, as requested; drank a glass of wine to each party (steady, your Majesty!), who\nall responded by glasses of wine, and threw the glasses aloft with shouts. Sixty pieces of\nartillery speaking the while, and the bands of music breathing their sweetest;--till it was\ndone, and his Majesty still steady on his feet. He could stand a great deal of wine.\n\nAnd now--? Well, the Cake is not done, many cubic yards of cake are still left, and the very\ncorporals can do no more: let the Army scramble! Army whipt it away in no time. And now, alas\nnow--the time IS come for parting. It is ended; all things end. Not for about an hour could\nthe HERRSCHAFTEN (Lordships and minor Sovereignties) fairly tear themselves away, under wailing\nmusic, and with the due emotion.\n\nThe Prussian Royalties, and select few, took boat down the River, on the morrow; towards Lichtenburg\nHunting-Palace, for one day's slaughtering of game. They slaughtered there about one thousand\nliving creatures, all driven into heaps for them,--\"six hundred of red game\" (of the stag species),\n\"four hundred black,\" or of the boar ditto. They left all these creatures dead; dined immensely;\nthen did go, sorrowfully sated; Crown-Prince Friedrich in his own carriage in the rear; Papa\nin his, preceding by a few minutes; all the wood horns, or French horns, wailing sad adieu;--and\nhurried towards Berlin through the ambrosial night. [28th June, 1730: _Helden-Geschichte,_ i. 205.]\n\nAnd so it is all ended. And August the Strong--what shall we say of August? History must admit\nthat he attains the maximum in several things. Maximum of physical strength; can break horse-shoes,\nnay half-crowns with finger and thumb. Maximum of sumptuosity; really a polite creature; no\nman of his means so regardless of expense. Maximum of Bastards, three hundred and fifty-four\nof them; probably no mortal ever exceeded that quantity. Lastly, he has baked the biggest Bannock\non record; Cake with 5,000 eggs in it, and a tun of butter. These things History must concede\nto him. Poor devil, he was full of good-humor too, and had the best of stomachs. His amputated\ngreat-toe does not mend: out upon it, the world itself is all so amputated, and not like mending!\nAugust the Strong, dilapidated at fifty-three, is fast verging towards a less expensive country:\nand in three years hence will be lodged gratis, and need no cook or flunky of either sex.\n\n\"This Camp of Radewitz,\" says Smelfungus, one of my Antecessors, finishing his long narrative\nof it, \"this Camp is Nothing; and after all this expense of King August's and mine, it flies\naway like a dream. But alas, were the Congresses of Cambrai and Soissons, was the life-long\ndiplomacy of Kaiser Karl, or the History of torpid moribund Europe in those days, much of a\nSomething? The Pragmatic Sanction, with all its protocolling, has fled, like the temporary\nPlayhouse of King August erected there in the village of Strohme. Much talk, noise and imaginary\ninterest about both; but both literally have become zero, WERE always zero. As well talk about\nthe one as the other.\"---Then why not SILENCE about both, my Friend Smelfnngus? He answers:\n\"That truly is the thing to be aimed at;--and if we had once got our own out of both, let both\nbe consumed with fire, and remain a handful of inarticulate black ashes forevermore.\" Heavens,\nwill I, of all men, object!\n\nSmelfungus says elsewhere:--\n\n\"The moral to be derived, perhaps the chief moral visible at present, from all this Section\nof melancholy History is: Modern Diplomacy is nothing; mind well your own affairs, leave those\nof your neighbors well alone. The Pragmatic Sanction, breaking Fritz's, Friedrich Wilhelm's,\nSophie's, Wilhelmina's, English Amelia's and I know not how many private hearts, and distracting\nwith vain terrors and hopes the general soul of Europe for five-and-twenty years, fell at once\ninto dust and vapor, and went wholly towards limbo on the storm-winds, doing nothing for or\nagainst any mortal. Friedrich Wilhelm's 80,000 well-drilled troops remained very actual with\ntheir firelocks and iron ramrods, and did a thing or two, there being a Captain over them.\nFriedrich Wilhelm's Directorium, well-drilled Prussian Downing Street, every man steady at\nhis duty, and no wind to be wasted where silence was better, did likewise very authentically\nremain,--and still remains. Nothing of genuine and human that Friedrich Wilhelm did but remained\nand remains an inheritance, not the smallest item of IT lost or losable;--and the rude foolish\nBoor-King (singular enough!) is found to be the only one that has gained by the game.\"--\n\nChapter IV. -- EXCELLENCY HOTHAM QUITS BERLIN IN HASTE.\n\nWhile the Camp at Radewitz is dissolving itself in this manner, in the last days of June, Captain\nGuy Dickens, the oracles at Windsor having given him their response as to Prince Friedrich's\nwild project, is getting under way for Berlin again,--whither also Hotham has returned, to\nwait for Dickens's arrival, and directly thereupon come home. Dickens is henceforth to do the\nBritish Diplomacy here, any Diplomacy there can well be; Dickens once installed, Hotham will,\nright gladly, wash his hands of this Negotiation, which he considers to be as good as dead\nfor a longish while past. First, however, he has one unexpected adventure to go through in\nBerlin; of most unexpected celebrity in the world: this once succinctly set forth, History\nwill dismiss him to the shades of private life.\n\nGuy Dickens, arriving we can guess about the 8th or 9th of July, brings two important Documents\nwith him to Berlin, FIRST, the English Response (in the shape of \"Instructions\" to himself,\nwhich may be ostensible in the proper quarter) in regard to the Crown-Prince's project of flight\ninto England. Response which is no other than might have been expected in the circumstances:\n\"Britannic Majesty sorry extremely for the Crown-Prince's situation; ready to do anything in\nreason to alleviate it. Better wait, however: Prussian Majesty will surely perhaps relent a\nlittle: then also the affairs of Europe are in a ticklish state. Better wait. As to that of\ntaking temporary refuge in France, Britannic Majesty thinks that will require a mature deliberation\n(MURE DELIBERATION). Not even time now for inquiry of the French Court how they would take\nit; which his Britannic Majesty thinks an indispensable preliminary,\"--and so terminates. The\nmeaning, we perceive, is in sum: \"Hm, you won't, surely? Don't; at least Don't yet!\" But Dryasdust,\nand any readers who have patience, can here take the Original Paper; which is written in French\n(or French of Stratford at the Bow), probably that the Crown-Prince, if needful, might himself\nread it, one of these days:--\n\n\"Monsieur Guy Dickens pourrait donner au Prince les assurances les plus fortes de la compassion\nque le Roi a du triste etat ou il se trouve, et du desir sincere de Sa Majeste de concourir\npar tout ce qui dependra d'elle a l'en tirer. M. Guy Dickens pourrait lui communiquer en meme\nterns les Instructions donnees a Monsieur Hotham [_our Answer to the Outrageous propositions,\nwhich amounts to nothing, and may be spared the reader_], et lui marquer qu'on avait lieu d'esperer\nque Sa Majeste Prussienne ne refuserait pas au moins de s'expliquer un peu plus en detail qu'elle\nn'a fait jusqu'ici. Qu'en attendant les suites que cette negociation pourrait avoir, Sa Majeste\netait d'avis que le Prince ferait bien de differer un peu l'execution de son dessein connu:\nQue la situation ou les affaires de l'Europe se trouvaient dans ce moment critique ne paraissait\npas propre a l'execution d'un dessein de cette nature: Que pour ce qui est de l'intention ou\nle Prince a temoigne etre, de se retirer en France, Sa Majeste croit qu'elle demande une mure\ndeliberation, et que le peu de tems qui reste ne promet pas meme qu'on puisse s'informer de\nce que la Cour de France pourrait penser la-dessus; dont Sa Majeste trouvait cependant absolument\nnecessaire de l'assurer, avant de pouvoir conseiller a un Prince qui lui est si cher de se\nretirer en ce pays la.\" [Prussian Despatches, vol. xii.: No date or signature; bound up along\nwith Harrington's Despatch, \"Windsor, 20th June [1st July] 1730,\"--on the morrow of which day\nwe may fancy Captain Dickens took the road for Berlin again,--where we auspiciously see him\non Monday, 10th July, probably a night or two after his arrival.] This is Document FIRST; of\nno concernment to Hotham at this stage; but only to us and our Crown-Prince. Document SECOND\nwould at one time have much interested Hotham: it is no other than a Grumkow Original seized\nat St. Mary Axe, such as Hotham once solicited, \"strong enough to break Grumkow's back.\" Hotham\nnow scarcely hopes it will be \"strong enough.\" No matter; he presents it as bidden. On introducing\nDickens as successor, Monday, 10th July, he puts the Document into his Prussian Majesty's hand:\nand--the result was most unexpected! Here is Hotham's Despatch to Lord Harrington; which it\nwill be our briefest method to give, with some minimum of needful explanation intercalated\nhere and there:--\n\n\"TO THE LORD HARRINGTON (from Sir Charles Hotham).\n\n\"BERLIN, 30th June (11th July), 1730.\n\n\"MY LORD,--Though the conduct of his Prussian Majesty has been such, for some time past, that\none ought to be surprised at nothing he does,--it is nevertheless with great concern that I\nnow have to acquaint your Lordship with an extravagancy of his which happened yesterday,\" Monday,\n10th July, 1730.\n\n\"The King of Prussia, had appointed me to be with him about noon, with Captain Guy Dickens\n[who has just returned from England, on what secret message your Lordship knows!].--We both\nattended his Prussian Majesty, and I presented Captain Guy Dickens to him, who delivered his\ncredentials: after which the King talked to us a quarter of an hour about indifferent matters.\nSeeing him in a very good humor, I took that opportunity of telling him, 'That as General Grumkow\nhad denied his having held a Secret Correspondence with Reichenbach, or having written the\nLetters I had some time ago delivered to his Majesty, I was now ordered by the King my Master\nto put into his hands an Original Letter of General Grumkow'\"----Where is that Original Letter?\nask some minute readers. Minute readers, the IPSISSIMUM CORPUS of it is lost to mankind. Official\nCopy of it lies safe here in the State-Paper Office (Prussian Despatches, volume xli.; without\ndate of its own, but near a Despatch dated 20th June, 1730); has, adjoined to it, an Autograph\njotting by George Second to the effect, \"Yes, send it,\" and also some preliminary scribbles\nby Newcastle, to the like purport. No date of its own, we say, though, by internal evidence\nand light of FASSMANN, [p. 404.] it is conclusively datable \"Berlin, 20th May,\" if anybody\ncared to date it. The Letter mentions lightly that \"pretended discovery [the St.-Mary-Axe one,\nlaid on the table of Tobacco-Parliament, 6th May or soon after], innocent trifles all _I_ wrote;\nhope you burnt them, nevertheless, according to promise: yours to me I did burn as they came,\nand will defy the Devil to produce;\" brags of his Majesty's fine spirits;--and is, Jotting\nand all, as insignificant a Letter as any other portion of the \"Rookery Colloquy,\" though its\nfate was a little more distinguished. Prussian Dryasdust is expected to give it in FAC-SIMILE,\none day,--surely no British Under-Secretary will exercise an unwise discretion, and forbid\nhim that small pleasure!--\"which was an undeniable proof of all the rest, and could not but\nconvince his Prussian Majesty of the truth of them.\"--Well?\n\n\"He took the Letter from me, cast his eye upon it; and seeing it to be Grumkow's hand, said\nto me with all the anger imaginable [fancy the thunder-burst!], _'Messieurs, j'ai eu assez\nde ces choses la;'_ threw the Letter upon the ground, and immediately turning his back went\nout of the room, and shut the door upon us,\"--probably with a slam! And that is the naked truth\nconcerning this celebrated Intercepted Letter. Majesty answered explosively,--his poor heart\nbeing in a burdened and grieved condition, not unlike growing a haunted one,--\"I have had enough\nof that stuff before!\" pitched the new specimen away, and stormily whirled out with a slam\nof the door. That he stamped with his foot, is guessable. That he \"lifted his foot as if to\nkick the Honorable English Excellency,\" [Wilhelmina, i. 228.] which the English Excellency\nnever could have stood, but must have died on the spot,--of this, though several Books have\ncopied it from Wilhelmina, there is no vestige of evidence: and the case is bad enough without\nthis.\n\n\"Your Lordship will easily imagine that Captain Guy Dickens and I were not a little astonished\nat this most extraordinary behavior. I took up the Letter he had thrown upon the floor [IPSISSIMUM\nCORPUS of it lost to mankind, last seen going into Hotham's pocket in this manner]; and returning\nhome, immediately wrote one to his Prussian Majesty, of which a copy is here enclosed.\"--Let\nus read that essential Piece: sound substance, in very stiff indifferent French of Stratford,--which\nmay as well be made English at once:--\n\n\"TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING OF PRUSSIA.\n\n\"SIRE,--It is with the liveliest grief that I find myself under the necessity,--after what\nhas passed today at the audience I had of your Majesty, where I neither did nor said anything\nin regard to that Letter of Monsieur Grumkow's or to putting it into your Majesty's hands,\nthat was not by my Master's order,--it is, I say, Sire, with the liveliest grief that I am\nobliged to inform your Majesty of the necessity there lies on me to despatch a Courier to London\nto apprise the King my Master of an incident so surprising as the one that has just happened.\nFor which reason I beg (SUPPLIE) your Majesty will be pleased to cause the necessary Orders\nfor Post-horses to be furnished me, not only for the said Courier, but also for myself,--since,\nafter what has just happened, it is not proper for me to prolong my stay here (_faire un plus\nlong sejour ici_).\n\n\"I have the honor to be, your Majesty's, &c. &c. &c.\n\n\"CHARLES HOTHAM.\"\n\n\"About two hours afterwards, General Borck came to me; and told me He was in the utmost affliction\nfor what had happened; and beseeched me to have a little patience, and that he hoped means\nwould be found to make up the matter to me. Afterwards he communicated to me, by word of mouth,\nthe Answer the King of Prussia had given to the last Orders I had received by Captain Guy Dickens,\"--Orders,\n\"Come home immediately,\" to which the \"Answer\" is conceivable.\n\n\"I told him that, after the treatment I had received at noon, and the affront put upon the\nKing my Master's character, I could no longer receive nor charge myself with anything that\ncame from his Prussian Majesty. That as to what related to me personally, it was very easily\nmade up; but having done nothing but in obedience to the King my Master's orders, it belonged\nto him only to judge what satisfaction was due for the indignity offered to his character.\nWherefore I did not look upon myself as authorized to listen to any expedients till I knew\nhis Majesty's pleasure upon the matter.\n\n\"In the evening, General Borck wrote a Letter to Captain Guy Dickens and two to me, the Copies\nof which are enclosed,\"--fear not, reader! \"The purport of them was to desire That I would\ntake no farther notice of what had happened, and that the King of Prussia desired I would come\nand dine with him next day.\"--Engaged otherwise, your Majesty, next day!\" The Answer to these\nLetters I also enclose to your Lordship,\"--reader not to be troubled with it. \"I excused myself\nfrom dining with the King of Prussia, not thinking myself at liberty to appear any more at\nCourt till I received his Majesty's,\" my own King's, \"commands, and told General Borck that\nI looked upon myself as indispensably obliged to acquaint the King my Master with everything\nthat had passed, it being to no purpose to think of concealing it, since the thing was already\nbecome public, and would soon be known in all the Courts of Europe.\n\n\"This, my Lord, is the true state of this unaccountable accident. You will see, by General\nBorck's Letter, that the King of Prussia, being now returned to his senses, is himself convinced\nof the extravagancy of this proceeding; and was very desirous of having it concealed;--which\nwas impossible; for the whole Town knew it an hour after it had happened.\n\n\"As to my own part, I am not a little concerned at this unfortunate incident. As it was impossible\nto foresee this fit of madness in the King of Prussia, there was no guarding against it: and\nafter it had happened, I thought I could do no less than resent it in the manner I have done,--without\nprostituting the character with which the King has been pleased to honor me. I hope, however,\nthis affair will be attended with no ill consequences: for the King of Prussia himself is at\npresent so ashamed of his behavior, that he says, He will order Count Degenfeld [Graf von Degenfeld,\ngoing at a leisurely pace to remove NOSTI from his perch among you] [Supra, p. 197.] to hasten\nhis journey to England, with orders to endeavor to make up the affair immediately.\n\n\"As I had already received the King's Orders, by Captain Guy Dickens, To return home forthwith,\nI thought, after what had happened, the sooner I left this place the better; and the rather\nbecause it might be proper I should make a report of it to his Majesty. I shall therefore set\nout a few hours after this Messenger; and will make all the expedition possible.\n\n\"The King of Prussia sets out for Anspach on Saturday next,\"--11th July is Tuesday, Saturday\nnext will be 15th July, which proves correct. [Fassmann, p. 410.] \"I am, with the utmost respect,\nMy Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient and most humble servant,\n\nCHARLES HOTHAM.\"\n\n[State-Paper Office: Prussian Despatches, vol. xli.] No sooner was the door slammed to than\nhis Majesty began to repent. At sight of the demand for Post-horses, he repented bitterly;\nsent Borck to ask Hotham to dinner, with what success we have seen. Sent Borck to negotiate,\nto correspond, to consult with Dickens, to do his utmost in pacifying Hotham. All which Correspondence\nexists, but is not worth giving. Borck's remonstrances are in rugged soldier-like style, full\nof earnestness and friendliness. Do not wreck, upon trifles, a noble interest we have in common;\nKing is jealous about foreign interference with his Ministers, but meant nothing; I tell you\nit is nothing I--Hotham is polite, good-tempered; but remains inflexible: With myself, on my\nown score, it were soon settled, or is already settled; but with the King my Master,--no expedient\nbut post-horses! The Diplomatist world of Berlin is in a fuss; Queen Sophie and \"the Minister\nof Denmark,\" with other friendly Ministers, how busy! \"All day,\" this day and the next, \"they\nspent in comings and goings\" [Wilhelmina, i. 229, 230.] advising Hotham to relent: Hotham could\nnot relent. The Crown-Prince himself writes, urged by a message from his Mother; Crown-Prince\nsends Katte off from Potsdam with this Billet [Ib. i. 230.] (if this be a correct copy to translate\nfrom)\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MONSIEUR THE CHEVALIER HOTHAM.\n\n\"POTSDAM, 11th July, 1730.\n\n\"MONSIEUR,--Having learned by M. de Leuvener,\" the Danish Minister, a judicious well-affected\nman, \"what the King my Father's ultimate intentions are, I cannot doubt but you will yield\nto his desires. Think, Monsieur, that my happiness and my Sister's depend on the resolution\nyou shall take, and that your answer will mean the union or the disunion forever of the two\nHouses! I flatter myself that it will be favorable, and that you will yield to my entreaties.\nI never shall forget such a service, but recognize it all my life by the most perfect esteem,\"\nwith which I now am, TOUT A VOUS,\n\n\"FREDERIC.\"\n\nThis Billet Katte delivers: but to this also Hotham remains inexorable; polite, hopeful even:\nNo harm will come; Degenfeld will go, I myself will help when at home; but for the present,\nno resource but post-horses! Which they at last yield him, the very post-horses ready to weep.\n\nAnd so Hotham, spirited judicious English gentleman, rolls off homewards, [\"Wednesday,\" 12th\n(Dickens).] a few hours after his Courier,--and retires honorably into the shades of private\nlife, steady there thenceforth. He has not been successful in Berlin: surely his Negotiation\nis now OUT in all manner of senses! Long ago (to use our former ignoble figure) he had \"laid\ndown the bellows, though there was still smoke traceable:\" but now, by this Grumkow Letter,\nhe has, as it were, struck the POKER through the business; and that dangerous manoeuvre, not\nproving successful, has been fatal and final! Queen Sophie and certain others may still flatter\nthemselves; but it is evident the Negotiation is at last complete. What may lie in flight to\nEngland and rash desperate measures, which Queen Sophie trembles to think of, we do not know:\nbut by regular negotiation this thing can never be.\n\nIt is darkly apprehended the Crown-Prince still meditates Flight; the maternal heart and Wilhelmina's\nare grieved to see Lieutenant Katte so much in his confidence--could wish him a wiser councillor\nin such predicaments and emergencies! Katte is greatly flattered by the Prince's confidence;\neven brags of it in society, with his foolish loose tongue. Poor youth, he is of dissolute\nways; has plenty of it \"unwise intellect,\" little of the \"wise\" kind; and is still under the\nyears of discretion. Towards Wilhelmina there is traceable in him something,--something as\nof almost loving a bright particular star, or of thrice-privately worshipping it for his own\nbehoof. And Wilhelmina, during the late Radewitz time, when Mamma \"gave four Apartments (or\nRoyal Soirees) weekly,\" was severe upon him, and inaccessible in these Court Soirees. A rash\nyoung fool; carries a loose tongue:--still worse, has a Miniature, recognizable as Wilhelmina;\nand would not give it up, either for the Queen's Majesty or me!--\"Thousand and thousand pardons,\nHigh Ladies both; my loose tongue shall be locked: but these two Miniatures, the Prince and\nPrincess Royal, I copied them from two the Prince had lent me and has got back, ask me not\nfor these;--never, oh, I cannot ever!\"--Upon which Wilhelmina had to take a high attitude,\nand pass him speechless in the Soirees. The foolish fellow:--and yet one is not heartily angry\neither; only reserved in the Soirees; and anxious about one's Brother in such hands.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm repents much that Hotham explosion; is heard saying that he will not again\ntreat in person with any Envoy from foreign parts, being of too hot temper, but will leave\nhis Ministers to do it. [Dickens's Despatch, Berlin, 22d July (n.s.), 1730.] To Queen Sophie\nhe says coldly, \"Wilhelmina's marriage, then, is off; an end to IT. Abbess of Herford [good\nProtestant refuge for unprovided Females of Quality, which is in our gift], let her be Abbess\nthere;\"--and writes to the then extant Abbess to make Wilhelmina \"Coadjutress,\" or Heir-Apparent\nto that Chief-Nunship! Nay what is still more mortifying, my Brother says, \"On the whole, I\nhad better, had not I?\" The cruel Brother; but indeed the desperate!--for things are mounting\nto a pitch in this Household.\n\nQueen Sophie's thoughts,--they are not yet of surrender; that they will never be, while a breath\nof life is left to Queen Sophie and her Project: we may fancy Queen Sophie's mood. Nor can\nhis Majesty be in a sweet temper; his vexations lately have been many. First, England is now\noff, not off-and-on as formerly: that comfortable possibility, hanging always in one's thoughts,\nis fairly gone; and now we have nothing but the Kaiser to depend on for Julich and Berg, and\nthe other elements of our salvation in this world! Then the St.-Mary-Axe discoveries, harassing\nshadows of suspicion that will rise from them, and the unseemly Hotham catastrophe and one's\nown blame in it; Womankind and Household still virtually rebellious, and all things going awry;\nMajesty is in the worst humor;--bullies and outrages his poor Crown-Prince almost worse than\never. There have been rattan-showers, hideous to think of, descending this very week [Guy Dickens's\nDespatch, 18th July, 1730.] on the fine head, and far into the high heart of a Royal Young\nMan; who cannot, in the name of manhood, endure, and must not, in the name of sonhood, resist,\nand vainly calls to all the gods to teach him WHAT he shall do in this intolerable inextricable\nstate of matters.\n\nFate and these two Black-Artists have driven Friedrich Wilhelm nearly mad; and he, in turn,\nis driving everybody so. He more than suspects Friedrich of an intention to fly; which is horrible\nto Friedrich Wilhelm: and yet he bullies him occasionally, as a spiritless wretch, for bearing\nsuch treatment. \"Cannot you renounce the Heir-Apparentship, then; your little Brother is a\nfine youth. Give it up; and go, unmolested, to the--in fact to the Devil: Cannot you?\"--\"If\nyour Majesty, against the honor of my Mother, declare that I am not your eldest son: Yes, so;\nnot otherwise, ever!\" modestly but steadily persists the young man, whenever this expedient\nis proposed to him,--as perhaps it already sometimes is. Whereat the desperate Father can only\nsnort indignantly futile. A case growing nearly desperate. Desperate, yes, on all hands: unless\none had the \"high mast\" above alluded to, with two pulleys and ropes; and could see a certain\nPair of Scoundrels mount rapidly thither, what hope is there for anybody? A violent crisis\ndoes not last, however; that is one certainty in it. Either these agonistic human beings, young\nand old, will all die, all go to Bedlam, with their intolerable woes; or else something of\nexplosive nature will take place among them. The maddest boil, unless it kill you with its\ntorments, does at length burst, and become an abscess.\n\nOf course Captain Dickens, the instant Hotham was gone, hastened privily to see the Crown-Prince;\nsaw Katte and him \"at the Gate of the Potsdam Palace at midnight,\" [Wilhelmina; Ranke, i. 301.]\nor in some other less romantic way;--read him the Windsor Paper of \"INSTRUCTIONS\" known to\nus; and preached from that text. No definite countenance from England, the reverse rather,\nyour Highness sees;--how can there be? Give it up, your Highness; at least delay it!--Crown-Prince\ndoes not give it up a whit; whether he delays it, we shall see.\n\nA busy week for the Crown-Prince and Katte, this of the Hotham Catastrophe; who have many consultations,\nthe Journey to Anspach being on Saturday next! Crown-Prince has given him in keeping a writing-case\nwith private letters; 1,000 ducats of money, money raised by loan, by picking jewels off some\nminiatures of honor, and the like sore methods."}

{"ID": 570, "text": "Its publishers (who may be prejudiced)\nconsider _The Avalanche_ as \"a brilliant and engaging study of mystery and romance;\" me it\nimpressed as a melodrama dependent on one long-heralded sensation, which proves on tardy arrival\nan affair of disappointment. I suppose I must be careful not to give away the mystery, such\nas it is. _Price Rugler_ was anxious to discover why his attractive wife assumed a worried\nlook when money was mentioned and fainted on being told that she was not to wear the family\nruby at a particular masque. All this happened (you may not be astonished to hear) in San Francisco,\namongst that luxurious, idle, over-moneyed society whose manners Mrs. ATHERTON knows and describes\nso well. _Price_ had already found out, with the assistance of a not too brilliant detective,\nthat his wife's mother derived her income from a gambling saloon; the remaining problem was\nhow to link up this knowledge with the odd behaviour of _Mrs. Price_. Perhaps you see it already.\nShe had been--No, I said I wouldn't, and I won't. Of course the discovery couldn't be called\ncheerful, though it was fortunately made in time to prevent any great harm. But it was nothing\nlike an avalanche.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: UNRECORDED HISTORY.\n\nINCONSIDERATE FLAPPER WAYLAYS KING JOHN ON HIS RETURN FROM SIGNING MAGNA CARTA AT RUNNYMEDE.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is much harder, I am afraid, to be a good Bengali than a good Englishman. _Nikhil_, the\nRajah of Sir RABINDRANATH TAGORE'S _The Home and the World_ (MACMILLAN), persists in treating\n_Sandip Babu_ (a convinced Nietzchean in philosophy and a Nationalist of the most inflammable\ntype) as an honoured guest of his household, in spite of the fact that he differs from the\nfellow profoundly on every conceivable topic and is well aware, moreover, that _Sandip_ is\nrapidly winning the heart of his Rani, _Bimala_. _Nikhil_, you see, considers that \"all imposition\nof force is weakness,\" and that \"only the weak dare not be just.\" Most Westerners, I think,\nwould have kicked the rhapsodical and rather plausible agitator out-of-doors and felt all the\nbetter for it from the boot-toe upwards. The real truth is that the story, which is written\nin the form of a triple autobiography (_Nikhil, Sandip_ and _Bimala_ all taking a hand at telling\nit in turn) is an exposition of two views of Suadeshi, or what may be called the Sinn Fein\nmovement in India."}

One Unremunerative-looking\nPedestrian, in knickerbockers, is assured that, if he waits half a\nday or so, he may get an attic--\"Back of se house; fine view of se\nsluice-gate and cemetery.\"--U.-L.P. expostulates; he has telegraphed\nfor a good room; it's _too_ bad.--\"Ver' sawy, but is quite complete\nnow, se H\u00f4tel.\" U.-L.P., furious; \"Hang it,\" &c. \"Mr.\" deprecates this\ningratitude--\"Ver' sawy, Sor; but if you don't like,\" (with decision),\n\"se whole wide wurrld is open to you!\" Pedestrian retires, threatening\nto write to the _Times_. Preposterous! as if the Editor would print\nanything against \"Mr.\"! \"Mr.'s\" attitude majestic and martyred;\nCASABIANCA in a frock-coat! Bless you! he knows us all, better than\nwe know ourselves. He sees the Cook's ticket through the U.-L.P.'s\nNorfolk-jacket.\n\n[Illustration: \"He sees the Cook's ticket through the U.-L.P.'s\nNorfolk-jacket.\"]\n\nWhen \"Mr.\" is not writing, he is changing money. The sheepish Briton\nstands dumb before this financier, and is shorn--of the exchange,\nwith an oafish fascination at \"Mr.'s\" dexterous manipulation of the\n_rouleaux_ of gold and notes. Nobody dares haggle with \"Mr.\" When he\nis not changing money, he is, as I have said, writing, perhaps his\nReminiscences. It is \"Mr.\" \"What gif you se informations;\" and _what_\nquestions! The seasoned Pensionnaire wants to know how she can get\nto that _lovely_ valley where the Tiger-lilies grow, without taking a\ncarriage. The British Matron, where she can buy rusks, \"real English\nrusks, you know.\" A cantankerous tripper asks \"why he never has\nbread-sauce with the nightly chicken.\" And we all troop to \"Mr.\" after\nbreakfast, to beg him to affix postage-stamps to our letters, and to\ndemand the precise time when \"they will reach England;\" as if they\nwouldn't reach at all without \"Mr.'s\" authority. It gives the nervous\na sense of security to watch \"Mr.\" stamping envelopes. It is a way of\nbeginning the day in a Grand H\u00f4tel.\n\n\"Mr.\" gives you the idea of not wishing to make a profit; but he gives\nyou nothing else. You wish to be \"_en pension_\"--\"Ver' well, Sor, it\nis seventeen francs (or marks) the day;\" but you soon discover that\nyour room is extra, and that you may not dine \"apart;\" in a word, you\nare \"Mr.'s\" bondsman. Then there is the persuasive lady, who perhaps,\n_may_ be stopping a week or more, but her plans are undecided--at any\nrate six days--\"Will 'Mr.' make a reduction?\" \"Mr.\" however, continues\nhis manuscript, oh ever so long! and smiles; his smile is worse than\nhis bite! I, the _Habitu\u00e9_, approach \"Mr.\" with a furtive clandestine\nair, and observe cheerily, \"I hope to remain here a month.\"\n\"Certainly, Sor; is better you do; will be se same as last year; I\ngif you se same appartement, you see.\"--This with an air of favour.\nI thank him profusely--for nothing. My bill turns out to be higher\nthan if I had been overcharged separately for everything. \"Mr.\" is\nthe Master of the Arts of extras. He does not wish to make a profit;\noh no! but--ahem--he makes it. As for the outsiders who straggle in\ncasually for luncheon and want to be sharp with \"Mr.\" afterwards,\nthey are soon settled. One who won't be done, complains of a prince's\nransom for a potato-salad.--\"If you haf pertatas, you pay for\npertatas.\"--TALLEYRAND could not have been more unanswerable.\n\n\"Mr.\" is immense at entertainments; it is \"Mr.\" who organises \"Se\nSpanish Consairt,\" \"Se Duetto of se Poor Blinds,\" and, of course, \"Se\nBal\"; he is very proud of his latest acquisition--the Orchestrion that\nplays the dinner down. To see \"Mr.\" dispatch itinerant minstrels would\ndo our County Council good.\n\n\"Mr.\" knows our compatriots _au fond_; he makes no extra charge for\ntoast at breakfast, and you only pay half-a-crown for a pot of George\nthe Third Marmalade, to lubricate it withal. Five-o'clock tea comes\nup at six, just as at home. He makes much of Actors, Peers, and\nClergymen. Sunday is a great day for \"Mr.\" He directs everyone to the\nEnglish Church in \"The Grounds\"--(fifteen benches and one tree, with a\nfountain between them); and then goes off to play cards, but always\nin his frock-coat. The \"Chaplain\" gets his breakfast-egg gratis; and\na stray Bishop writes, \"Nothing can exceed the comfort of this H\u00f4tel,\"\nin that Doomsday Book of Visitors.\n\nWhen you depart--and, abroad, this is generally about daybreak--\"Mr.\"\nis always on the spot, haughty, as becomes a man about to be paid, but\nconsiderate; there is a bouquet in petticoats for the Entresol--even,\nfor me, a condescending word. \"_When you see_ Mr. SHONES _in London,\nyou tell him next year I make se Gulf-Links._\" I don't know who\nthe dickens JONES may be, but I snigger. It all springs from that\nmiserable fiction of being an _Habitu\u00e9_. \"_Sans adieux!_\" ejaculates\n\"Mr.,\" who is great at languages; so am I, but, somehow, find myself\nsaying \"Good-bye\" quite naturally. _\u00c0 propos_ of languages, \"Mr.\"\nis very patient with the Ladies who _will_ speak to him in so-called\nFrench or German, when they say, \"_O\u00f9 est le Portier?_\" or \"_Es\nist sehr sch\u00f6n heute_,\" he replies, in the genuine tongue. I once\noverheard a lady discussing the chances of rest and quiet in the\n\"Grand H\u00f4tel.\" \"_Oui c'est une grande reste_.\" said she. It only\npuzzled \"Mr.\" for a moment. \"_Parfaitement, Madame; c'est ravissant,\nn'est-ce pas?_\" and then \"Mr.\" sold her the little Hand-book, composed\nby the Clergyman, on which he receives a commission.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNEED I SAY MORE?\n\n  I loved--and need I say she was a woman?\n    And need I say I thought her just divine?\n  Her beauty (like this rhyme) was quite uncommon.\n    Alas, she said she never could be mine!\n\n  My Uncle was a Baronet, and wealthy,\n    But old, ill-tempered, deaf, and plagued with gout;\n  I was his heir, a pauper young and healthy;\n    My Uncle--need I say?--had cut me out.\n\n  I swore--and need I say the words I muttered?\n    Sir HECTOR married KATE, and changed his will.\n  Dry bread for me!

Since they were last here, Government been defeated;\nthe MARKISS out, Mr. G. in, and all that means or portends. Not\nmany present, but the MARKISS in his place smiling in unaffected\njoyousness, just as Prince ARTHUR did in Commons when the end came.\n\n[Illustration: \"Very odd!\"]\n\n\"Very odd,\" said PICKERSGILL, pressing his hat to his bosom; \"it seems\nnothing amuses the CECILS and their family belongings so much as a\nreverse at the Poll.\"\n\nThe MARKISS in such exuberant good humour at seeing KIMBERLEY opposite\nto him, could not resist temptation to try on little joke. It was\nnot, he said, either desirable or usual that he, as outgoing Minister,\nshould say anything on present occasion. But perhaps KIMBERLEY would\noblige, and would give House full exposition of intentions of new\nMinistry with respect to foreign and domestic affairs. KIMBERLEY\ngravely answered, that not yet being Minister of the Crown, nor having\nhad opportunity of consulting with his colleagues, he was unprepared\nto make statement on subject.\n\nIn this dilemma DENMAN came to front. \"My Lords--\" he said. What\nmore he would have uttered is lost to posterity. MARKISS had moved\nadjournment of House, and HALSBURY, who has had long practice on this\nparticular wicket, promptly bowled DENMAN out, by putting question and\ndeclaring it carried. DENMAN stood moment looking, more in sorrow than\nanger, at noble Lords hurrying out with unwonted agility.\n\n[Illustration: THE NEW CABINET.]\n\n\"They made a mistake,\" he murmured; \"especially HALSBURY. All I wanted\nwas to propose vote of thanks to him for the grace and dignity with\nwhich he has presided over Debates in this House, and the manner in\nwhich he has, by his dispensation of patronage, preserved the highest\ntraditions of his office, and even raised its lofty tone. Too late\nnow, too late;\" and the old gentleman putting his crumpled papers in\nhis pocket, and wrapping his soiled pocket-handkerchief round the knob\nof his walking-stick, strode sadly forth.\n\n[Illustration: \"Bless me!\"]\n\nPerhaps it was sight of this pathetic figure that sobered the MARKISS.\nAnyhow, as we walked out together, found him in subdued mood, more\nfitting the occasion than that assumed when addressing House. \"All\nover at last, TOBY,\" he said; \"and I may go down to Hatfield, take\noff my coat, and have a day's, or even a week's serene pleasure in my\nworkshop. I'm nobody of any account now, _ni_ Premier, _ni_ Foreign\nMinister. Do you remember the lines written by an unknown hand on the\nruins of Berytus, which TRYPHON, King of Syria, sacked a hundred and\nforty years before the Star rose at Bethlehem? I was thinking of them\njust now, even when I was chaffing KIMBERLEY:--\n\n  'Stay not your course, O Mariners, or me,\n    Nor furl your sails--is not my harbour dry?\n    Nought but one vast, forsaken tomb am I."}

A {Bad Thing}.\n\n:write-only language: n. A language with syntax (or semantics)\n   sufficiently dense and bizarre that any routine of significant size\n   is {write-only code}.  A sobriquet applied occasionally to C and\n   often to APL, though {INTERCAL} and {TECO} certainly deserve it\n   more.\n\n:write-only memory: n. The obvious antonym to `read-only\n   memory'.  Out of frustration with the long and seemingly useless\n   chain of approvals required of component specifications, during\n   which no actual checking seemed to occur, an engineer at Signetics\n   once created a specification for a write-only memory and included\n   it with a bunch of other specifications to be approved.  This\n   inclusion came to the attention of Signetics {management} only\n   when regular customers started calling and asking for pricing\n   information.  Signetics published a corrected edition of the data\n   book and requested the return of the `erroneous' ones.  Later,\n   around 1974, Signetics bought a double-page spread in `Electronics'\n   magazine's April issue and used the spec as an April Fools' Day\n   joke.  Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves, the\n   25120 \"fully encoded, 9046 x N, Random Access, write-only-memory\"\n   data sheet included diagrams of \"bit capacity vs. Temp.\",\n   \"Iff vs. Vff\", \"Number of pins remaining vs. number of socket\n   insertions\", and \"AQL vs. selling price\".  The 25120 required a\n   6.3 VAC VFF supply, a +10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, +/- 2%.\n\n:Wrong Thing: n. A design, action, or decision that is clearly\n   incorrect or inappropriate.  Often capitalized; always emphasized\n   in speech as if capitalized.  The opposite of the {Right Thing};\n   more generally, anything that is not the Right Thing.  In cases\n   where `the good is the enemy of the best', the merely good ---\n   although good --- is nevertheless the Wrong Thing. \"In C, the\n   default is for module-level declarations to be visible everywhere,\n   rather than just within the module.

Imaginary sound that a computer\n   program makes as it labors with a tedious or difficult task.\n   Compare {cruncha cruncha cruncha}, {grind} (sense 4).\n\n:WYSIAYG: /wiz'ee-ayg/ adj. Describes a user interface under\n   which \"What You See Is *All* You Get\"; an unhappy variant of\n   {WYSIWYG}.  Visual, `point-and-shoot'-style interfaces tend to\n   have easy initial learning curves, but also to lack depth; they\n   often frustrate advanced users who would be better served by a\n   command-style interface.  When this happens, the frustrated user\n   has a WYSIAYG problem.  This term is most often used of editors,\n   word processors, and document formatting programs.  WYSIWYG\n   `desktop publishing' programs, for example, are a clear win for\n   creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them,\n   especially things like newsletters and presentation slides.  When\n   typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale\n   changes the nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG\n   limitations, and the increased power and flexibility of a\n   command-driven formatter like TeX or UNIX's `troff(1)' becomes\n   not just desirable but a necessity.\n\n:WYSIWYG: /wiz'ee-wig/ adj. Describes a user interface under\n   which \"What You See Is What You Get\", as opposed to one that uses\n   more-or-less obscure commands which do not result in immediate\n   visual feedback.  True WYSIWYG in environments supporting multiple\n   fonts or graphics is a a rarely-attained ideal; there are variants\n   of this term to express real-world manifestations including\n   WYSIAWYG (What You See Is *Almost* What You Get) and\n   WYSIMOLWYG (What You See Is More or Less What You Get).  All these\n   can be mildly derogatory, as they are often used to refer to\n   dumbed-down {user-friendly} interfaces targeted at\n   non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure commands (compare\n   {WYSIAYG}).  On the other hand, {EMACS} was one of the very first\n   WYSIWYG editors, replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the\n   extremely obscure, command-based {TECO}.  See also {WIMP\n   environment}.  [Oddly enough, WYSIWYG has already made it into the\n   OED, in lower case yet. --- ESR]\n\n= X = =====\n\n:X: /X/ n. 1. Used in various speech and writing contexts (also\n   in lowercase) in roughly its algebraic sense of `unknown within a\n   set defined by context' (compare {N}).  Thus, the abbreviation\n   680x0 stands for 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, or 68040, and 80x86\n   stands for 80186, 80286 80386 or 80486 (note that a UNIX hacker\n   might write these as 680[0-4]0 and 80[1-4]86 or 680?0 and 80?86\n   respectively; see {glob}).  2.

For more than a\n   decade, from the early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an\n   astonishing volume of groundbreaking hardware and software\n   innovations.  The modern mice, windows, and icons style of software\n   interface was invented there.  So was the laser printer, and the\n   local-area network; and PARC's series of D machines anticipated the\n   poweful personal computers of the 1980s by a decade.  Sadly, these\n   prophets were without honor in their own company; so much so that\n   it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a place characterized\n   by developing brilliant ideas for everyone else.\n\n:XOFF: /X'of/ n. Syn. {control-S}.\n\n:XON: /X'on/ n. Syn. {control-Q}.\n\n:xor: /X'or/, /kzor/ conj. Exclusive or.  `A xor B' means\n   `A or B, but not both'.  \"I want to get cherry pie xor a\n   banana split.\"  This derives from the technical use of the term as\n   a function on truth-values that is true if exactly one of its two\n   arguments is true.\n\n:xref: /X'ref/ vt., n. Hackish standard abbreviation for\n   `cross-reference'.\n\n:XXX: /X-X-X/ n. A marker that attention is needed.\n   Commonly used in program comments to indicate areas that are kluged\n   up or need to be.

The {canonical} `magic word'.\n   This comes from {ADVENT}, in which the idea is to explore an\n   underground cave with many rooms and to collect the treasures you\n   find there.  If you type `xyzzy' at the appropriate time, you can\n   move instantly between two otherwise distant points.  If,\n   therefore, you encounter some bit of {magic}, you might remark\n   on this quite succinctly by saying simply \"Xyzzy!\"  \"Ordinarily\n   you can't look at someone else's screen if he has protected it, but\n   if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you do it\n   anyway.\"  \"Xyzzy!\"  Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an\n   undocumented no-op command on several OSes; in Data General's\n   AOS/VS, for example, it would typically respond \"Nothing\n   happens\", just as {ADVENT} did if the magic was invoked at the\n   wrong spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled\n   the word.  In more recent 32-bit versions, by the way, AOS/VS\n   responds \"Twice as much happens\".  See also {plugh}.\n\n= Y = =====\n\n:YA-: [Yet Another] abbrev.

The state in which the system is said to be when it\n   rapidly alternates several times between being up and being down.\n   Interestingly (and perhaps not by coincidence), many hardware\n   vendors give out free yoyos at Usenix exhibits.\n\n   Sun Microsystems gave out logoized yoyos at SIGPLAN '88.  Tourists\n   staying at one of Atlanta's most respectable hotels were\n   subsequently treated to the sight of 200 of the country's top\n   computer scientists testing yo-yo algorithms in the lobby.\n\n:Yu-Shiang Whole Fish: /yoo-shyang hohl fish/ n. obs. The\n   character gamma (extended SAIL ASCII 0001001), which with a loop in\n   its tail looks like a little fish swimming down the page.  The term\n   is actually the name of a Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked\n   whole (not {parse}d) and covered with Yu-Shiang (or Yu-Hsiang)\n   sauce.  Usage: primarily by people on the MIT LISP Machine, which\n   could display this character on the screen.

To make\n   someone `suffer' by making his food spicy.  (Most hackers love\n   spicy food.  Hot-and-sour soup is considered wimpy unless it makes\n   you wipe your nose for the rest of the meal.)  See {zapped}.\n   4. vt. To modify, usually to correct; esp. used when the action\n   is performed with a debugger or binary patching tool.  Also implies\n   surgical precision.  \"Zap the debug level to 6 and run it again.\"\n   In the IBM mainframe world, binary patches are applied to programs\n   or to the OS with a program called `superzap', whose file name is\n   `IMASPZAP' (possibly contrived from I M A SuPerZAP).  5. vt. To\n   erase or reset.  6. To {fry} a chip with static electricity.\n   \"Uh oh --- I think that lightning strike may have zapped the disk\n   controller.\"\n\n:zapped: adj. Spicy.  This term is used to distinguish between food\n   that is hot (in temperature) and food that is *spicy*-hot.\n   For example, the Chinese appetizer Bon Bon Chicken is a kind of\n   chicken salad that is cold but zapped; by contrast, {vanilla}\n   wonton soup is hot but not zapped.  See also {{oriental food}},\n   {laser chicken}.  See {zap}, senses 1 and 2.\n\n:zen: vt. To figure out something by meditation or by a sudden flash\n   of enlightenment.  Originally applied to bugs, but occasionally\n   applied to problems of life in general.  \"How'd you figure out the\n   buffer allocation problem?\"  \"Oh, I zenned it.\"  Contrast {grok},\n   which connotes a time-extended version of zenning a system.\n   Compare {hack mode}.  See also {guru}.\n\n:zero: vt. 1. To set to 0.  Usually said of small pieces of data,\n   such as bits or words (esp. in the construction `zero out').  2. To\n   erase; to discard all data from.  Said of disks and directories,\n   where `zeroing' need not involve actually writing zeroes throughout\n   the area being zeroed.  One may speak of something being\n   `logically zeroed' rather than being `physically zeroed'.  See\n   {scribble}.\n\n:zero-content: adj. Syn. {content-free}.\n\n:zeroth: /zee'rohth/ adj. First.  Among software designers, comes\n   from C's and LISP's 0-based indexing of arrays.  Hardware people\n   also tend to start counting at 0 instead of 1; this is natural\n   since, e.g., the 256 states of 8 bits correspond to the binary\n   numbers 0, 1, ..., 255 and the digital devices known as `counters'\n   count in this way.\n\n   Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first\n   chapter of a publication `chapter 0', especially if it is of an\n   introductory nature (one of the classic instances was in the First\n   Edition of {K&R}).  In recent years this trait has also been\n   observed among many pure mathematicians (who have an independent\n   tradition of numbering from 0).  Zero-based numbering tends to\n   reduce {fencepost error}s, though it cannot eliminate them\n   entirely.\n\n:zigamorph: /zig'*-morf/ n. Hex FF (11111111) when used as a\n   delimiter or {fence} character.  Usage: primarily at IBM\n   shops.\n\n:zip: [primarily MS-DOS] vt. To create a compressed archive from a\n   group of files using PKWare's PKZIP or a compatible archiver.  Its\n   use is spreading now that portable implementations of the algorithm\n   have been written.  Commonly used as follows: \"I'll zip it up and\n   send it to you.\"  See {arc}, {tar and feather}.\n\n:zipperhead: [IBM] n. A person with a closed mind.\n\n:zombie: [UNIX] n. A process that has died but has not yet\n   relinquished its process table slot (because the parent process\n   hasn't executed a `wait(2)' for it yet).  These can be seen in\n   `ps(1)' listings occasionally.  Compare {orphan}.\n\n:zorch: /zorch/ 1. [TMRC] v. To attack with an inverse heat sink.\n   2. [TMRC] v.

To\n   propel something very quickly.  \"The new comm software is very\n   fast; it really zorches files through the network.\"  4. [MIT] n.\n   Influence.  Brownie points.  Good karma.  The intangible and fuzzy\n   currency in which favors are measured.  \"I'd rather not ask him\n   for that just yet; I think I've used up my quota of zorch with him\n   for the week.\"  5. [MIT] n.

God only knows what the\nTurks are expecting if the Austro-Servian conflict turns out according to their desires, or\nif the European conflict takes the form of a decisive Austro-German victory. We now have ample\nproof to show that the Turkish mobilization is in such a way conducted as to be ready to act\nin common with Bulgaria, in a simultaneous attack against Greek and Servian Macedonia, as soon\nas the Austrians have a first decisive victory over the Servians. This scheme, however, seems\nto be doomed since the entry of Great Britain into the general war, and there are indications\nthat Turkey, warned by England and Russia, will disband her already mobilized army. On the\nother hand, the news reaches Constantinople that the Russian forces have crossed the frontier\ninto Turkish Armenia, and occupied Erzeroum, while Enver Pasha was seen yesterday, (Aug. 5,)\npaying hasty visits to the Russian and British Embassies. While such is the political situation,\nmatters are still worse in the business world of the Turkish capital. It is almost impossible\nto give an idea of the general upheaval brought about by greedy speculators, who are taking\nadvantage of this anomalous situation, and by the Government itself, requisitioning everything\nthey can lay their hands on, regardless of reason or necessity.\n\nPolicemen and Sheriffs, followed by military officers, are taking by force everything in the\nway of foodstuffs, entering the bakeries and other shops selling victuals, boarding ships with\ncargoes of flour, potatoes, wheat, rice, &c., and taking over virtually everything, giving\nin lieu of payment a receipt which is not worth even the paper on which it is written.\n\nIn this way many shops are forced to close, bread has entirely disappeared from the bakeries,\nand Constantinople, the capital of a neutral country, is already feeling all the troubles and\nprivations of a besieged city. Prices for foodstuffs have soared to inaccessible heights as\nprovisions are becoming scarce. Actual hand-to-hand combats are taking place in the streets\noutside the bakeries for the possession of a loaf of bread, and hungry women with children\nin their arms are seen crying and weeping in despair.\n\nMany merchants, afraid lest the Government requisition their goods, hastened to have their\norders canceled, the result being that no merchandise of any kind is coming to Constantinople\neither from Europe or from Anatolia.\n\nBoth on account of the recruiting of their employes and of shortage of coal the companies operating\nthe electric tramways of the city have reduced their service to the minimum, as no power is\navailable for the running of the cars.\n\nHeartrending scenes are witnessed in front of the closed doors of the various banking establishments,\nwhere large posters are to be seen, bearing the inscription: _Closed temporarily, by order\nof the Government._ The most popular of these institutions is the Wiener Bankverein. This bank,\nby making special inducements to small depositors and by paying a higher interest than the\nothers, succeeded in concentrating the savings of many people of the working classes, and as\nthis institution is in imminent danger the rush to its doors is exceptionally great and riotous.\n\nThe municipality has issued a number of ordinances fixing the prices of all necessary commodities,\nand the Government, after the first panic, declared that no further requisitions are to be\nmade. At the same time the authorities took special pains in order to induce the various merchants\nto import goods from abroad, thus relieving the extremely strained situation of the market;\nbut it is doubtful whether such measures will have any calming effect on the scared population.\n\nImmediately after war was declared between Germany and Russia the Porte ordered the Bosphorus\nand the Dardanelles closed to every kind of shipping, at the same time barring the entrances\nof these channels with rows of mines. The first boat to suffer from this measure was a British\nmerchantman, which was sunk outside the Bosphorus, while another had a narrow escape in the\nDardanelles. A large number of steamers of every nationality are waiting outside the straits\nfor the special pilot boats of the Turkish Government, in order to pass in safety through the\ndangerous mine field. This measure of closing the straits was suggested to Turkey by Austria\nand Germany, and was primarily intended against Russia, as it was feared that her Black Sea\nfleet might force its way into the Sea of Marmora and the Aegean.\n\nTURKISH PARLIAMENT PROROGUED.\n\n_On Sunday, Aug. 2, the Medjlissi-Meboussan, or Parliament of Turkey, was urgently called together,\nand the Speaker of the House addressed the members as follows:_\n\nDear Colleagues: The imperial proclamation ordering the last elections has produced some uneasiness\nboth within and without the empire. It was said at that time that the Chamber was to be convened\nonly to give vent to partisan feeling and to disturb the quiet of the country. The elections,\nhowever, proceeded in as orderly a way as possible, and the Chamber performed its duty with\ngreat order and solicitude, having voted the budget and many other laws. The country accordingly\nis convinced that the Chamber has fulfilled its duty with relative calm, in view of the circumstances.\nWe part today in order to meet again in November. The war between Austria-Hungary and Servia\nhas a tremendous importance in the general European situation. While until yesterday Europe\nwas kept in a state of watchful waiting, now we are informed that war has been declared between\nGermany and Russia. In face of such an international situation, it behooves all us Ottomans\nto rally in a spirit of harmony around the imperial throne, and to act with the moderation\ncharacteristic of our race for the preservation of our country.\n\nHoping that the great example given by Parliament to the nation as regards the working in a\nspirit of harmony and order will have its due influence on the country at large, I salute you\nand bid you farewell.\n\nTHE MOBILIZATION.\n\n_One of the first schemes of the German General, Liman von Sanders, for the reorganization\nof the Turkish Army was to provide a system whereby a speedier mobilization of the forces could\nbe made possible. According to this scheme, as far back as the first days of May, 1914, every\nMayor and village President of the empire was provided with a sealed envelope, under orders\nto open it only on telegraphic notice from the Central Administration. These envelopes were\nopened on Aug. 3, and were found to contain the papers constituting the order of general mobilization,\nincluding a large poster in colors, bearing, under the imperial monogram, or \"Tougrah,\" two\ncrossed green Turkish flags, with crossed sword and rifle, and underneath a gun and its carriage,\nand lastly the imperial edict in large letters, reading as follows:_\n\nA general mobilization was ordered to\nstart on ........................\n         (To be dated on notice.)\n\nThose liable for duty must report at\ntheir respective headquarters. First day\nof mobilization is on ........................\n                      (To be dated on notice.)\n\nDIPLOMATIC SITUATION AND PRESS OPINIONS.\n\n_While Turkey in this way was preparing for war, Talaat Bey, the Turkish Minister of the Interior,\nand Halil Bey, President of the Chamber, were leaving Constantinople for Bucharest, where they\nintended meeting the representatives of the Greek Government, in order to find a way of settling\nthe outstanding Greco-Turkish differences regarding the Aegean Islands and the question of\nrefugees. The object of this political move was twofold. First, Turkey was bent on giving to\nEurope a proof of her pacific intentions, and, second, she was trying to convince the Hellenic\nGovernment of her willingness to reach an understanding regarding their mutual differences,\nand begin anew the friendly relations of yore. The following extract is from an editorial article\npublished in the Ikdam of Constantinople on Aug. 17:_\n\nFrom today the regeneration of our fleet begins. From today Ottoman hearts must again rejoice.\nWe must work hard now for the strengthening of our navy. We must know that our fleet, which\ntill yesterday was lifeless, is no longer in incompetent hands and under the leadership of\nlazy minds. New Turkey has intrusted her navy to iron hands. At the head of our fleet is Dj\u00e9mal\nPasha, whose naval successes it is unnecessary to mention. The commander of the fleet is the\nChief of the Naval Staff, Arif Bey, and in command of the light flotilla is Capt. Muzzafer\nBey. Likewise the commanders and the other officers of the two new battleships are chosen among\nthe fittest. This is the beginning of a new era for our navy. In addition to this we must say\nthat we are expecting good results from our political activity. Talaat Bey and Halil Bey have\nleft for Bucharest, where they will try to find a solution of outstanding serious questions.\nAt the same time they will have an opportunity to exchange views with Rumanian statesmen. It\nis unnecessary, in our belief, to exalt the significance of this mission. We think, however,\nthat a wise and moderate policy, strengthened by a good army and navy, will go far in bringing\ngood results.\n\n_On Sept. 10 an official announcement from the Sublime Porte was handed to the representatives\nof the powers in Constantinople, and communicated to the press. This declaration ran as follows:_\n\nAs an expression of the sentiments of hospitality and friendship on the part of the Ottoman\nGovernment toward the European populations of the empire, there were instituted long ago certain\nregulations to which Europeans coming to the Levant for commerce would be subjected, these\nsame regulations having been duly communicated to the respective Governments of those Europeans.\n\nThese regulations, adopted by the Porte on its own initiative, and considered entirely as privileges,\nand having been strengthened and made more general through certain acts, have continued to\nbe in force up to this time under the name \"Old Treaties,\" (in Turkish \"Ouhout-i Atikah.\")\nThese privileges, however, are wholly incompatible with the legal status of recent years, and\nespecially with the principle of national sovereignty. In the first place, they became a hindrance\nto the progress and development of the Imperial Government, while in the second, by creating\nmisunderstandings in its relations with the foreign Governments, they formed a barrier preventing\nthese relations from becoming more harmonious and more sincere.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire continues to advance in the path of regeneration and of reforms, overleaping\nmany obstacles, and in order to acquire the position due to it in the civilized family of Europe,\nit adopted modern principles of government, and has not deviated from its programme of having\nthe State conducted on these principles.\n\nThe founding of the constitutional form of government is in itself a proof that the efforts\nof the Ottoman Empire for its regeneration have been fully crowned with success. Certain exceptions,\nhowever, based on the capitulations, such as the participation of foreigners in the administration\nof justice, which is an all-important prerogative of national sovereignty, the limitations\nimposed on the legislative rights of the State, based on the argument that certain laws cannot\nbe applied to foreigners, the injustice inflicted on common right from the impossibility of\nconvicting a delinquent who disturbs the safety of the country merely because he happens to\nbe a foreigner, or because the prosecution against him must be subjected to certain limitations\nand particular conditions; and likewise the difference in the competency of the various courts\ndealing with cases where the capitulations are involved; all these constitute impregnable barriers\nagainst every effort of the country toward progress in the administration of justice.\n\nFrom another point of view, the fact that foreigners living in the Ottoman Empire are exempt\nfrom taxation, in accordance with the capitulations, makes it impossible for the Sublime Porte\nto procure the indispensable means for the carrying out, not only of the reforms but of its\neveryday needs.\n\nThe impossibility of increasing the indirect taxation is bringing about the increase of direct\ntaxes, and therefore makes the burden on the Ottoman tax-payers all the heavier. The fact that\nforeigners who enjoy in the Ottoman Empire every protection and every privilege as well as\nfreedom in their business transactions are exempt from taxation constitutes in itself an intolerable\ninjustice and creates at the same time a situation detrimental to the independence and prestige\nof the Government.\n\nWhile the Imperial Government was firm in its resolution to continue its efforts regarding\nthe reforms, the general war broke and increased the financial difficulties of the country\nin such a degree that all the innovations and all the reforms which have been decided upon\nand actually begun are threatened to remain without effect.\n\nThe Sublime Porte feels convinced that the only way toward salvation for the Ottoman Government\nlies in the realization of the necessary reforms in the least possible time. In the same way\nthe Porte feels that every encouragement will be shown her in the decisive steps to be undertaken\nfor this end.\n\nConvinced of this, the Imperial Government has decided to abolish, on Oct. 1, 1914, the capitulations,\nand all conventions, concessions, and privileges emanating therefrom, which have become an\niron ring around the State, making it impossible for it to progress.\n\nAt the same time the Ottoman Government engages to treat with foreign countries in accordance\nwith the rules of international law. While I have the honor of communicating to your Excellency\nthis decision, which opens a new and happy era in the life of the Ottoman Empire, an event\nwhich undoubtedly will please your Excellency, I consider it my duty to add that the Porte\nin abolishing the capitulations does not harbor any hostile feeling against any of the foreign\nStates, but is acting solely in the highest interests of the empire. At the same time, the\nPorte is ready to begin pourparlers for the conclusion of commercial treaties in accordance\nwith the principles of international law.\n\n_The Turkish press made little mention of the manner in which Europe took notice of the important\nstep taken by the Porte, and the Ministerial Tasfiri Efkiar was the only one to express the\nfeelings of the Government on this occasion, saying:_\n\nIt is not proper for us to expect a unanimous and speedy satisfaction from all the European\npowers; but, on the other hand, we must welcome every objection and every discussion from whatever\nsource it comes, as in this way we shall know who are our friends and who our enemies.\n\nAPPROACHING THE CRISIS.\n\n_The events covering the period from Sept. 10, when the abolition of the capitulations was\ndecided upon, till Oct. 29, when the Turkish fleet attacked Russian ports and shipping in the\nBlack Sea, were confined mostly to hasty and all-absorbing warlike preparations on the part\nof the Turkish Government, assisted by the German military mission. The Constantinople correspondent\nof The Daily Atlantis of New York wrote on Sept. 17:_\n\nWe are daily approaching a crisis. The Government has not swerved from its warlike attitude,\nand is threatening not only Greece, but Russia and the Triple Entente as well, while, on the\nother hand, it has failed to secure Rumanian or Bulgarian co-operation in its militant policy.\nAt the same time, the Porte has learned that efforts are being made in the Balkans for common\naction against Turkey. It also became known that the Governments of London and Petrograd agreed\nto indemnify Bulgaria by giving her Adrianople and Thrace, while Greece was to have Smyrna,\nwith a considerable hinterland.\n\nDuring this period the Turkish press maintained an active campaign against England and the\nAllies. The following extract from an editorial article published in the Terdjumani-Hakkikat\nthus characterizes the situation:\n\n     Everybody knows that the Balkan States are traversing a\n     period of doubts, and that the belligerent parties are doing\n     their best in order to secure the sympathies and the\n     assistance of the Balkan States.\n\n     To begin with, the idea of reconstructing the Balkan League\n     came under consideration. In this way the Balkan States\n     think they will become strong enough to impose their will at\n     the final settlement that will follow the war. This idea,\n     however, based as it is on the nullification of the Treaty\n     of Bucharest, and on certain sacrifices on the part of\n     Rumania and Greece, proved to be a failure. In the course of\n     the discussion between the two States it was shown that\n     neither Greece nor Rumania was willing to make any sacrifice\n     in favor of Bulgaria. The Balkan Alliance, being thus\n     unpracticable, the belligerent powers of Europe attempted to\n     attract Rumania and Bulgaria only, and to this end they made\n     every sort of promise to the two Governments of Sofia and\n     Bucharest. The President of the London Balkan Committee, Mr.\n     Noel Buxton, went to Bulgaria and made certain promises to\n     Mr. Radoslavoff, the Bulgarian Premier, in the name of Sir\n     Edward Grey. He promised the restitution to Bulgaria of the\n     Enos-Midia line, including Adrianople. The Bulgarians,\n     however, are not to be fooled in this way by promises at the\n     expense of third parties, and especially when the eventual\n     cost of these gifts might be a heavy one. We must not forget\n     that Bulgaria wants not Thrace, but Macedonia. If Great\n     Britain had promised Bulgaria Macedonia, including Saloniki,\n     and the Bulgarian Government was convinced beforehand of the\n     fulfillment of the promise, then it is certain that the\n     proposal would be accepted. But this is not in line with\n     England's interests, because in that case she would lose her\n     two other customers--Greece and Servia. And so there goes\n     Mr. Buxton making offers out of our own pocket.\n\n     But we Turks have been used to injustices; and it has become\n     an axiom in history that whenever there is trouble in any\n     part of the world we must be the ultimate sufferers. It\n     seems that this time, too, \"our friends\" felt like repeating\n     the same story; but now we are not to be caught napping, and\n     the Government, having in time mobilized the army, is ready\n     for every emergency.\n\n_On Sept. 27 a Turkish destroyer having been stopped by a British destroyer outside the Dardanelles,\nthe Turkish Government ordered the straits closed to all shipping._\n\n_The Turkish Government tried to justify in the official press of Constantinople the measure\nof closing the straits by declaring that this important step was undertaken only after a Franco-British\nfleet had established an actual blockade of the straits to the detriment of Turkish commerce\nand neutral navigation. The Government organ, The Tasfiri-Efkiar, said:_\n\nThe powers are trying to justify the mobilization of Switzerland, and are making a great case\nof Belgian neutrality, but meantime they consider our mobilization as having no other purpose\nthan an aggression against our neighbors.\n\nNow, if the neutrality of Switzerland, which is guaranteed by all the powers, is likely to\nbe endangered, how is it possible for us to remain calm and undisturbed in this universal upheaval,\nso long as we know that to annoy and continually harass Turkey according to the fancies of\nEurope has well-nigh become a sort of fashion?\n\nThose powers that are dissatisfied at our mobilization are eager to find our anxiety as without\nfoundation for the mere reason that our territorial integrity remains under the guarantee of\nall the powers. But where was that guarantee when Tripoli and Cyrenaica were attacked in a\nway little differing from open brigandage? And was it not the same powers who forgot their\nguaranties in the Balkan Peninsula when they abolished the famous status quo? With such facts\nbefore us is it not ridiculous to speak of European guaranties? While we have now before us\nwhat happened to Belgium, why should our mobilization excite such widespread indignation? All\nwe are trying to do is to safeguard and protect our interests and protect ourselves from aggression\non the part of the Balkan States.\n\nWAR DECLARED.\n\n_On Oct. 29, 1914, the attack of the Turkish forces upon Russia and England was delivered.\nFollowing is the official Turkish version of the events leading to the rupture of diplomatic\nrelations between Turkey and the Triple Entente, contained in the first Turkish communiqu\u00e9\nof the war, appearing in the Turkish press on Oct. 31, 1914:_\n\nWhile on the 27th of October a small part of the Turkish fleet was manoeuvring in the Black\nSea, the Russian fleet, which at first confined its activities to following and hindering every\none of our movements, finally, on the 29th, unexpectedly began hostilities by attacking the\nOttoman fleet.\n\nDuring the naval battle which ensued the Turkish fleet, with the help of the Almighty, sank\nthe mine-layer Pruth, displacing 5,000 tons and having a cargo of 700 mines; inflicted severe\ndamage on one of the Russian torpedo boats, and captured a collier.\n\nA torpedo from the Turkish torpedo boat Gairet-i-Millet sank the Russian destroyer Koubanietz,\nand another from the Turkish torpedo boat Mouavenet-i-Millet inflicted serious damage on a\nRussian coastguard ship.\n\nThree officers and seventy-two sailors, rescued by our men and belonging to the crews of the\ndamaged and sunken vessels of the Russian fleet, have been made prisoners. The Ottoman imperial\nfleet, glory be given to the Almighty, escaped injury, and the battle is progressing favorably\nfor us.\n\nThe Imperial Government will no doubt protest most energetically against this hostile action\nof the Russian fleet against a small part of our fleet.\n\nInformation received from our fleet now in the Black Sea is as follows: From accounts of Russian\nsailors taken prisoners and from the presence of a mine-layer among the Russian fleet, evidence\nis gathered that the Russian fleet intended closing the entrance to the Bosphorus with mines\nand destroying entirely the imperial Ottoman fleet after having split it in two. Our fleet,\nbelieving that it had to face an unexpected attack, and supposing that the Russians had begun\nhostilities without a formal declaration of war, pursued the scattered Russian fleet, bombarded\nthe port of Sebastopol, destroyed in the city of Novorosiysk fifty petroleum depots, fourteen\nmilitary transports, some granaries, and the wireless telegraph station.\n\nIn addition to the above, our fleet has sunk in Odessa a Russian cruiser and damaged severely\nanother. It is believed that this second boat was likewise sunk."}

{"ID": 471, "text": "Hincks appears to require the following. While seeking information upon the\nfirst of these matters, I took up one of my old school-books, and at the foot of a page found\nthe following note: \"Britannia is from _Barat-anac_, the land of tin.\" I do not recollect to\nhave seen it elsewhere; but it appeared to me so apt and correct that I adopted it at once.\n\nThat the Shirutana of the Egyptian inscriptions, {446} or Shairetana, will be found to be the\nsame people as the Cir\u00e1tas of the Hindu Puranas, I have little doubt.\n\nCir\u00e1tas is there applied as a name to the people who were afterwards known to us as the Phoenicians;\nbut that either the Shirutana or the Cir\u00e1tas will be found to have discovered Britain, though\nthey may have given it a name, I do not expect. The Cir\u00e1tas were a people of a later age to\nthat of the first inhabitants of Britain. The first inhabitants of Britain I call the Celt\u00e6,\nas I know no other name for them; but there seems reason for thinking that this island was\nvisited by an earlier tribe, though probably they were of the same race.\n\nThe origin of the Cir\u00e1tas and first inhabitants of Britain is this:--A powerful monarchy appears\nto have been established at the earliest dawn of history in the country we now call Persia,\nlong before there was any Assyrian government, and under this monarchy that country was the\ntrue centre of population, of knowledge, of languages, and of arts. Three distinct races of\nmen appear to have migrated in different directions from this their common country. One of\nthese divides into two parts, one proceeding to the west, the other to the south-east of the\nplace where the division took place. The western party passed through Asia Minor, and also\nby the north of the Black Sea, carrying with it all that was then known of the different arts\nand sciences, until we find the descendants at this day in the British Isles. The south-eastern\nparty, also, continued its progress to the part now known to us as India, where its descendants\nmay be found at this day. Long after the settlement in India, various tribes, all proceeding\nfrom it, migrated from that country to the parts now known to us as Egypt and Syria; and one\nof these tribes was the Cir\u00e1tas.\n\nThat the Cir\u00e1tas, Shirutana, or Phoenicians, call them as you may, were the first who passed\nthe Pillar of Hercules in ships on their way to obtain tin here at first-hand, is almost certain;\nand that the western party, as described above, had broken ground to supply it long before\ntheir customers came for it, is scarcely less so. They all had a common origin, and used nearly\nthe same language, religion, and laws.\n\nMy Query has brought out a highly satisfactory elucidation of the origin of the term _Britain_;\nand this, looking at the position in which that term stood on the day the last Number of \"N.\n& Q.\" was published is by no means a slight acquisition.

The Act of Uniformity is given in black-letter. The\nOrdinal is wanting. The three State Services are not enumerated in the Table of Contents, but\nare added at the end of the book. The Old Version of the Psalms (with its usual quaint title),\na tract of 104 pp., is appended: \"London: printed by Thos.

In the frontispiece is represented a female figure kneeling with a prayer book\nopen before her: an angel {447} in the air holds a scroll, on which is inscribed, \"The Liturgy\nof the Church of England, adorned with fifty-five historical cuts, P. La Vergne del., M. Van\nder Gucht sc.\" Beneath the picture, \"Sold by Robt. Whitledge at the Bible in Ave Maria Lane,\nnear Stationers' Hall.\"\n\nSome of the cuts are very curious, as No. 16., which represents the Devil (adorned with a crown,\nsceptre, and tail) standing on the top of a high conical rock, and our Blessed Lord at a little\ndistance from him. The appearance and attitude of the Apostles are somewhat grotesque. One\nof the best is St. Philip (No. 39.), who is represented as a wrinkled, bearded old man, contemplating\na crucifix in his hand.\n\nNo. 51. is a picture of Guy Fawkes approaching the Parliament House, with a lantern in his\nhand.

At\nthis period they may, I think, be always found in Covent Garden Market. I saw them last year\nalso in the greengrocers' shops at Brighton. To me these are evident traces of an old custom\nof using the yew as well as the willow. The origin is to be found in the Jewish custom of carrying\n\"branches of palm-trees, and boughs of _thick trees_, and willows from the brook\" (Leviticus\nxxiii. 39, 40.).\n\nWordsworth alludes to this in his sonnet on seeing a procession at Chamouny:\n\n \"The Hebrews thus carrying in joyful state\n  Thick boughs of palm and willows from the brook,\n  March'd round the altar--to commemorate\n  How, when their course they from the desert took,\n  Guided by signs which ne'er the sky forsook,\n  They lodged in leafy tents and cabins low,\n  Green boughs were borne.\"\n\nIn _A Voyage from Leith to Lapland_, 1851, vol. i. p. 132., there is an account of the funeral\nof the poet Oehlenschl\u00e4ger. The author states,--\n\n    \"The entire avenue was strewn, according to the old Scandinavian\n    custom, with evergreen boughs of fir, and bunches of fir and box,\n    mingled in some instances with artificial flowers. It is customary at\n    all funerals to strew evergreens before the door of the house where the\n    body lies, but it is only for some very distinguished person indeed\n    they are strewn all the way to the burial place.\"\n\nForby, in his _East Anglican Vocabulary_, says it is a superstitious notion that--\n\n    \"If you bring yew into the house at Christmas amongst the evergreens\n    used to dress it, you will have a death in the family before the end of\n    the year.\"\n\nI believe the yew will be found generally on the south side of the church, but always near\nthe principal entrance, easy of access for the procession on Palm Sunday, and perhaps for funerals,\nand that it was used as a substitute for the palm, and coupled with \"the willow from the brook,\"\nhence called the palm willow.\n\nA HOLT WHITE.\n\nP. S.--I cannot agree with your correspondent J. G. CUMMING, that the yew is one of \"our few\nevergreens.\" I doubt our having in England any native evergreen but the holly.\n\nThe etymology of the name of the yew-tree clearly shows that it was not planted in churchyards\nas an emblem of evil, but one of immortality. The name of the tree in Celtic is _jubar_, pronounced\n_yewar_, _i. e._ \"the evergreen head.\" The town of {448} Newry in Ireland took its name from\ntwo yew-trees which St. Patrick planted: _A-Niubaride_, pronounced _A-Newery_, _i. e._ \"the\nyew-trees,\" which stood until Cromwell's time, when some soldiers ruthlessly cut them down.\n\nIn the Note by MR. J. G. CUMMING, a derivation is evidently required for the English word _yeoman_,\nwhich he suggests is taken from \"yokeman.\" Yeoman is from _e[=o]_, pronounced _yo_, _i. e._\nfree, worthy, respectable, as opposed to the terms _villein_, serf, &c.; so that yeoman means\na freeman, a respectable person.\n\nFRAS. CROSSLEY.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOSBORN FAMILY.\n\n(Vol. viii., p. 270.)\n\nMr. H. T. Griffith asks where may any pedigree of the _Osborne_ family, previous to Edward\nOsborne, the ancestor of the Dukes of Leeds, be seen. In reply, I am in possession of large\ncollections relating to the Norman Osbornes, from whom I have reasons to believe him to have\nbeen descended. Those Osbornes can be proved to have been settled in certain of the midland\ncounties of England from the time of the attainder and downfall of the son of William Fitzosborne,\nEarl of Hereford and premier peer, down to a comparatively late period. A branch of them was\npossessed of the manor of Kelmarsh in Northamptonshire; and their pedigree, beginning in 1461,\nmay be seen in Whalley's _Northamptonshire_: but this is necessarily very imperfect, on account\nof the author's want of access to documents which have subsequently been opened to the public.\n\nI may here notice that an inexcusable error has been committed and repeated in several of the\ncollections of records published by the Parliamentary Commission, who have, in numerous instances,\nand without any warrant, interpreted _Osb._ of the MSS. as \"Osbert.\" Thus they have deprived\n_Fitzosborne_, Bishop of Exeter (A.D. 1102), of some of his manors, and within his own diocese,\nand conferred them on _Osbert the Bishop_, although there never was a bishop of that name in\nEngland. I took the liberty of pointing out this error to one of the chief editors concerned\nin these works; but as he has taken no notice of my observations, I must infer that he thinks\nit most prudent to excite no farther inquiry.\n\nThe _Osborns_, now so numerous in London, appear to have come from the Danish stem from which\nthe Norman branch was originally derived. Their number, which has increased even beyond the\nordinary ratio of the population, may perhaps be dated from the wife of one of them who (temp.\nJac. I.) had twenty-four sons, and was interred in old St. Paul's.\n\nI shall be very happy to afford any assistance in my power to the gentleman who has occasioned\nthese remarks.\n\nOMICRON.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nINSCRIPTIONS ON BELLS.\n\n(Vol. vi., p. 554.; Vol. vii., pp. 454. 603.; Vol. viii., pp. 108. 248.)\n\nMany thanks are due to your correspondent CUTHBERT BEDE, B.A., for his interesting series of\ninscriptions on bells. The following are, I think, sufficiently curious to be added to your\ncollection:--\n\nRouen Cathedral:\n\n    \"In the steeple of the great church, in the citie of Roane in Normandy,\n    is one great bell with the like inscription.\" [Like, that is, to the\n    inscription at St. Stephen's, Westminster: see \"N. & Q.\" Vol. viii., p.\n    108.]\n\n \"Je suis George de Ambois,\n  Qui trente-cinque mille pois;\n  Mes luis qui me pesera,\n  Trente-six mille me trouvera.\"\n\n \"I am _George of Ambois_,\n  Thirtie-five thousand in pois;\n  But he that shall weigh me,\n  Thirty-six thousand shall find me.\"--Weever, _Fun.

I fear that, if all your readers anxious to clear up an obscure\npoint in an interesting science take no more trouble than P. P., we shall find ourselves no\n{449} nearer our object in the middle of your eightieth volume than we are now in your eighth.\n\nWhat P. P. is pleased to term the \"routine\" reason is after all but one among many, and is\nnot better substantiated than some of the others quoted by me; for though the lozenge has a\n\"supposed\" resemblance to the distaff or fusil, heraldically it is but a supposed one, and\nby most writers the difference is very distinctly indicated.\n\nBoyer says:\n\n    \"A fusil is a bearing in heraldry made in the form of a spindle, with\n    its yarn or thread wound about it. _Fusils are longer than lozenges_,\n    and taper or pointed at both ends.\"\n\nThe same author thus describes a lozenge:\n\n    \"A Rhimbus, in geometry, is a figure of four equal and parallel sides,\n    but not rectangular.\"\n\nRobson says:\n\n    \"Fusil, a kind of spindle used in spinning. Its formation should be\n    particularly attended to, _as few painters or engravers make a\n    sufficient distinction between the fusil and lozenge_.\"\n\nNisbet describes a lozenge to be--\n\n    \"A figure that has equal sides and unequal angles, as the quarry of a\n    glass window placed erect pointways.\"\n\nHe adds:\n\n    \"The Latins say, 'Lozeng\u00e6 fact\u00e6 sunt ad modum lozangiorum in vitreis.'\n    Heralds tell us that their use in armories came from the pavement of\n    marble stones of churches, fine palaces and houses, cut after the form\n    of lozenges, which pavings the French and Italians call loze and the\n    Spaniards _loza_.\"\n\nSylvester de Petra-Sancta of the lozenge says much the same:\n\n    \"Scutulas oxigonias scu acutangulus erectas, et quasi gradiles, referri\n    debere ad latericias et antiquas domus olim, viz. Nobilium quia vulgus,\n    et infami\u00e6 sortis homines, intra humiles casus, vet antra\n    inhabitantur.\"\n\nOf the fusil Nisbet writes:\n\n    \"The fusil is another Rhombular figure like the lozenge, but more long\n    than broad, and its upper and lower points are more acute than the two\n    side points.\"\n\nHe adds that:\n\n    \"Chassanus and others make their sides round, as in his description of\n    them: 'Fus\u00e6 sunt acut\u00e6 in superiore et inferiore partibus, et rotund\u00e6\n    ex utroque latere;' which description has occasioned some English\n    heralds, when so painted or engraven, to call them millers' picks, as\n    Sir John Boswell, in his _Concords of Armory_, and others, to call them\n    weavers' shuttles.\"\n\nMenestrier says of lozenges:\n\n    \"Lozange est une figure de quatre pointes, dont deux sont un peu plus\n    \u00e9tendues que les autres, et assise sur une de ces pointes. C'est le\n    Rhomb des math\u00e9maticiens, et les quarreaux des vitres ordinaires en ont\n    la figure.\"\n\nOf fusils:\n\n    \"Fus\u00e9es sont plus \u00e9tendues en longue que les lozanges, et affil\u00e9es en\n    point comme les fuseaux. Elles sont pi\u00e8ces d'architecture o\u00f9 l'on se\n    sert pour ornement de fus\u00e9es et de pesons.\"\n\nThe celebrated _Boke of St. Albans_ (1486) thus describes the difference between a lozenge\nand fusil:\n\n    \"Knaw ye y^e differans betwix ffusillis and losyng."}

There are certain\nrivers which represent nations, and ideas, and periods of history--the\nScamander for instance, bringing to our thoughts the days of Grecian\nheroism; when men fought with gods, and in so doing seemed to wrest from\nthem a portion of their supernatural strength and beauty--the Nile, the\npriestly Nile, mysterious as a dogma, but rich in blessings as the\nagency of a divine spirit; concealed in its source, but manifest in its\noperation--then the Jordan, the stream of revelation, on whose banks is\nheard the rushing of the wings of the dove, while a voice, other than\nthat of man, murmurs over the waters--and the Tiber, a small and muddy\nstream, but the gigantic and sparkling reflex of Rome's immortal\nturrets. But the Rhine, that heroic river, which nations never cross\nwithout buckling on their armour for the fight; and yet, on whose banks\nlife is so free, so safe, and so delightful.

{"ID": 332, "text": "I've learned a few words but they\nhave so many different definitions that I can't use them.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Brender said. \"Variable and unrelated definitions, undetectable shades of inflection--and\nsometimes a language that has no discernibly separate words. The Singer brothers of Ship Eight\nran into the latter. We've given them up as lost.\"\n\n\"The Singers--dead?\" he exclaimed. \"Good God--it's been only a month since the Ramon brothers\nwere killed.\"\n\n\"The circumstances were similar,\" Brender said. \"They always are. There is no way the Exploration\nmen can tell the natives that they mean them no harm and the suspicion of the natives grows\ninto dangerous hostility. The Singers reported the natives on that world to be both suspicious\nand possessing powerful weapons. The Singers were proceeding warily, their own weapons always\nat hand. But, somehow, the natives caught them off-guard--their last report was four months ago.\"\n\nThere was a silence, then Brender added, \"Their ship was the ninth--and we had only fifteen.\"\n\nHe did not reply to the implications of Brender's statement. It was obvious to them all what\nthe end of the Plan would be. What it had to be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had been only three years since the fifteen heavily armed Exploration ships set out to lead\nthe way for Terran expansion across the galaxy; to answer a cry from far planets, and to find\nall the worlds that held intelligent life. That was the ultimate goal of the Plan: to accumulate\nand correlate all the diverse knowledge of all the intelligent life-forms in the galaxy. Among\nthe achievements resulting from that tremendous mass of data would be a ship's drive faster\neven than hyperspace; the Third Level Drive which would bring all the galaxies of the universe\nwithin reach.\n\nAnd now nine ships were gone out of fifteen and nineteen men out of thirty....\n\n\"The communication barrier,\" Brender said. \"The damned communication barrier has been the cause\nbehind the loss of every ship. And there is nothing we can do about it. We're stymied by it....\"\n\nThe conversation was terminated shortly afterward and he moved about the room restlessly, wishing\nit was time to lift ship again. With Johnny not there the dark world was like a smothering\ntomb. He would like to leave it behind and drive again into the star clouds of the galaxy;\ndrive on and on into them--\n\nA ghostly echo touched his mind; restless, poignantly yearning. He swung to face the locked\ndoor, knowing there could be nothing behind it. The first real fear came to him as he did so.\nThe thing was lonely--the thing that watched him was as lonely as he was....\n\nWhat else could any of it be but the product of a mind in the first stage of insanity?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe natives came ten minutes later.\n\nThe viewscreen showed their chemically-powered vehicle emerge from the trees and roll swiftly\nacross the glade. Four natives were in it while a fifth one lay on the floor, apparently badly\ninjured.\n\nThe vehicle stopped a short distance in front of the airlock and he recognized the native on\nthe floor. It was Throon, the one with whom he had been exchanging language lessons.\n\nThey were waiting for him when he emerged from the ship, pistol-like weapons in their belts\nand grim accusation in their manner.\n\nThroon was muttering unintelligibly, unconscious. His skin, where not covered by the brown\nfur, was abnormal in appearance. He was dying.\n\nThe leader of the four indicated Throon and said in a quick, brittle voice: \"_Ko reegar feen\nno-dran!_\"\n\nOnly one word was familiar: _Ko_, which meant \"you\" and \"yesterday\" and a great many other\nthings. The question was utterly meaningless to him.\n\nHe dropped his hand a little nearer his blaster as the leader spoke again; a quick succession\nof unknown words that ended with a harshly demanding \"_kreson!_\"\n\n_Kreson_ meant \"now,\" or \"very quickly.\" All the other words were unfamiliar to him. They waited,\nthe grim menace about them increasing when he did not answer. He tried in vain to find some\nway of explaining to them he was not responsible for Throon's sickness and could not cure it.\n\nThen he saw the spray of leaves that had caught on the corner of the vehicle when it came through\nthe farther trees.\n\nThey were of a deep purple color. All the trees around the ship were almost gray by contrast.\n\nWhich meant that he _was_ responsible for Throon's condition.\n\nThe cold white light of the ship's floodlights, under which he and Throon had sat for day after\nday, contained radiations that went through the violet and far into the ultraviolet. To the\nanimal and vegetable life of the dark world such radiations were invisibly short and deadly.\n\nThroon was dying of hard-radiation sickness.\n\nIt was something he should have foreseen and avoided--and that would not have happened had\nhe accepted old Throon's pantomimed invitation, in the beginning, to go with him into the village\nto work at the language study. There he would have used a harmless battery lamp for illumination\n... but there was no certainty that the natives were not planning to lay a trap for him in\nthe village and he had refused to go.\n\nIt did not matter--there was a complex radiation-neutralizer and cell-reconstructor in the\nship which would return Throon to full, normal health a few hours after he was placed in its\nchamber.\n\nHe turned to the leader of the four natives and motioned from Throon to the airlock. \"Go--there,\"\nhe said in the native language.\n\n\"_Bron!_\" the leader answered. The word meant \"No\" and there was a determination in the way\nhe said it that showed he would not move from it.\n\nAt the end of five minutes his attempts to persuade them to take Throon into the ship had increased\ntheir suspicion of his motives to the point of critical danger. If only he could tell them\n_why_ he wanted Throon taken into the ship ... But he could not and would have to take Throon\nby first disposing of the four without injuring them. This he could do by procuring one of\nthe paralyzing needle-guns from the ship.\n\nHe took a step toward the ship and spoke the words that to the best of his knowledge meant:\n\"I come back.\"\n\n\"_Feswin ilt k'la._\"\n\nTheir reply was to snatch at their weapons in desperate haste, even as the leader uttered a\nhoarse word of command. He brought up the blaster with the quick motion that long training\nhad perfected and their weapons were only half drawn when his warning came:\n\n\"_Bron!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey froze, but did not release their weapons. He walked backward to the airlock, his blaster\ncovering them, the tensely waiting manner in which they watched his progress telling him that\nthe slightest relaxation of his vigilance would mean his death. He did not let the muzzle of\nthe blaster waver until he was inside the airlock and the outer door had slid shut.\n\nHe was sure that the natives would be gone when he returned. And he was sure of another thing:\nThat whatever he had said to them, it was not what he had thought he was saying.\n\nHe saw that the glade was empty when he opened the airlock again. At the same time a bomb-like\nmissile struck the ship just above the airlock and exploded with a savage crash. He jabbed\nthe _Close_ button and the door clicked shut barely in advance of three more missiles which\nhammered at its impervious armor.\n\nSo that, he thought wearily, is that.\n\nHe laid the useless needle-gun aside. The stage was past when he could hope to use it. He could\nsave Throon only by killing some of the others--or he could lift ship and leave Throon to die.\nEither action would make the natives hate and fear Terrans; a hatred and fear that would be\nthere to greet all future Terran ships.\n\nThat was not the way a race gave birth to peaceful galactic empire, was not the purpose behind\nthe Plan. But always, wherever the Exploration men went, they encountered the deadly barrier;\nthe intangible, unassailable communication barrier. With the weapons an Exploration man carried\nin his ship he had the power to destroy a world--but not the power to ask the simple questions\nthat would prevent fatal misunderstandings.\n\nAnd before another three years had passed the last Exploration man would die, the last Exploration\nship would be lost.\n\nHe felt the full force of hopelessness for the first time. When Johnny had been alive it had\nbeen different; Johnny, who had laughed whenever the outlook was the darkest and said, \"_We'll\nfind a way, Paul--_\"\n\nThe thought broke as suddenly, unexpectedly, he felt that Johnny was very near. With the feeling\ncame the soft enclosure of a dream-like peace in which Johnny's death was vague and faraway;\nonly something that had happened in another dream. He knew, without wondering why, that Johnny\nwas in the control room.\n\nA part of his mind tried to reject the thought as an illusion. He did not listen--he did not\nwant to listen. He ran to the ship's elevator, stumbling like one not fully awake. Johnny was\nwaiting for him in the control room--alive--alive--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe spoke as he stepped into the control room:\n\n\"Johnny--\"\n\nSomething moved at the control board, black and alien, standing tall as a man on short hind\nlegs. Yellow eyes blazed in a feline face.\n\nIt was a cave cat, like the ones that had killed Johnny.\n\nRealization was a wrenching shock and a terrible disillusionment. Johnny was not waiting for\nhim--not alive--\n\nHe brought up the blaster, the dream-like state gone. The paw of the cave cat flashed out and\nstruck the ship's master light switch with a movement faster than his own. The room was instantly,\ntotally, dark.\n\nHe fired and pale blue fire lanced across the room, to reveal that the cave cat was gone. He\nfired again, quickly and immediately in front of him. The pale beam revealed only the ripped\nmetal floor.\n\n\"_I am not where you think._\"\n\nThe words spoke clearly in his mind but there was no directional source. He held his breath,\nlistening for the whisper of padded feet as the cave cat flashed in for the kill, and made\na swift analysis of the situation.\n\nThe cave cat was telepathic and highly intelligent and had been on the ship all the time. It\nand the others had wanted the ship and had killed Johnny to reduce opposition to the minimum.\nHe, himself, had been permitted to live until the cave cat learned from his mind how to operate\nthe almost-automatic controls. Now, he had served his purpose--\n\n\"_You are wrong._\"\n\nAgain there was no way he could determine the direction from which the thought came. He listened\nagain, and wondered why it had not waylaid him at the door.\n\nIts thought came:\n\n\"_I had to let you see me or you would not have believed I existed. It was only here that I\ncould extinguish all lights and have time to speak before you killed me. I let you think your\nbrother was here...._\" There was a little pause. \"_I am sorry. I am sorry. I should have used\nsome other method of luring you here._\"\n\nHe swung the blaster toward what seemed to be a faint sound near the astrogator unit across\nthe room.\n\n\"_We did not intend to kill your brother._\"\n\nHe did not believe it and did not reply.\n\n\"_When we made first telepathic contact with him, he jerked up his blaster and fired. In his\nmind was the conviction that we had pretended to be harmless animals so that we could catch\nhim off-guard and kill him. One of us leaped at him as he fired the second time, to knock the\nblaster from his hand. We needed only a few minutes in which to explain--but he would not trust\nus that long. There was a misjudgment of distance and he was knocked off the cliff._\"\n\nAgain he did not reply.\n\n\"_We did not intend to kill your brother_,\" the thought came, \"_but you do not believe me_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe spoke for the first time. \"No, I don't believe you. You are physically like cats and cats\ndon't misjudge distances. Now, you want something from me before you try to kill me, too. What\nis it?\"\n\n\"_I will have to tell you of my race for you to understand. We call ourselves the Varn, in\nso far as it can be translated into a spoken word, and we are a very old race. In the beginning\nwe did not live in caves but there came a long period of time, for thousands of years, when\nthe climate on our world was so violent that we were forced to live in the caves. It was completely\ndark there but our sense of smell became very acute, together with sufficient sensitivity to\ntemperature changes that we could detect objects in our immediate vicinity. There were subterranean\nplants in the caves and food was no problem._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_We had always been slightly telepathic and it was during our long stay in the caves that\nour intelligence and telepathic powers became fully developed. We had only our minds--physical\nscience is not created in dark caves with clumsy paws._\n\n\"_The time finally came when we could leave the caves but it was of little help to us. There\nwere no resources on our world but earth and stone and the thin grass of the plains. We wondered\nabout the universe and we knew the stars were distant suns because one of our own suns became\na star each winter. We studied as best we could but we could see the stars only as the little\nwild animals saw them. There was so much we wanted to learn and by then we were past our zenith\nand already dying out. But our environment was a prison from which we could never escape._\n\n\"_When your ship arrived we thought we might soon be free. We wanted to ask you to take some\nof us with you and arrange for others of your race to stop by on our world. But you dismissed\nus as animals, useful only for making warm fur coats, because we lived in caves and had no\nscience, no artifacts--nothing. You had the power to destroy us and we did not know what your\nreaction would be when you learned we were intelligent and telepathic. A telepathic race must\nhave a high code of ethics and never intrude unwanted--but would you have believed that?_\"\n\nHe did not answer.\n\n\"_The death of your brother changed everything. You were going to leave so soon that there\nwould be no time to learn more about you. I hid on the ship so I could study you and wait until\nI could prove to you that you needed me. Now, I can--Throon is dying and I can give you the\nproper words of explanation that will cause the others to bring him into the ship._\"\n\n\"Your real purpose--what is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"_To show you that men need the Varn. You want to explore the galaxy, and learn. So do the\nVarn. You have the ships and we have the telepathic ability that will end the communication\nproblem. Your race and mine can succeed only if we go together._\"\n\nHe searched for the true, and hidden, purpose behind the Varn proposal and saw what it would\nhave to be.\n\n\"The long-range goal--you failed to mention that ... your ultimate aim.\"\n\n\"_I know what you are thinking. How can I prove you wrong--now?_\"\n\nThere was no way for the Varn to prove him wrong, nor for him to prove the treachery behind\nthe Varn proposal. The proof would come only with time, when the Terran-Varn co-operation had\ntransformed Terrans into a slave race.\n\nThe Varn spoke again. \"_You refuse to believe I am sincere?_\"\n\n\"I would be a naive fool to believe you.\"\n\n\"_It will be too late to save Throon unless we act very quickly. I have told you why I am here.\nThere is nothing more I can do to convince you but be the first to show trust. When I switch\non the lights it will be within your power to kill me._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Varn was gambling its life in a game in which he would be gambling the Plan and his race.\nIt was a game he would end at the first sound of movement from the astrogator unit across the\nroom....\n\n\"_I have been here beside you all the time._\"\n\nA furry paw brushed his face, claws flicked gently but grimly reminding along his throat.\n\nHe whirled and fired. He was too late--the Varn had already leaped silently away and the beam\nfound only the bare floor. Then the lights came on, glaringly bright after the darkness, and\nhe saw the Varn.\n\nIt was standing by the control board, its huge yellow eyes watching him. He brought the blaster\ninto line with it, his finger on the firing stud. It waited, not moving or shrinking from what\nwas coming. The translucent golden eyes looked at him and beyond him, as though they saw something\nnot in the room. He wondered if it was in contact with its own kind on Johnny's World and was\ntelling them it had made the gamble for high stakes, and had lost.\n\nIt was not afraid--not asking for mercy....\n\nThe killing of it was suddenly an act without savor. It was something he would do in the immediate\nfuture but first he would let it live long enough to save Throon.\n\nHe motioned with the blaster and said, \"Lead the way to the airlock.\"\n\n\"_And afterward--you will kill me?_\"\n\n\"Lead the way,\" he repeated harshly.\n\nIt said no more but went obediently past him and trotted down the corridor like a great, black dog.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood in the open airlock, the Varn against the farther wall where he had ordered it to\nstand. Throon was in the radiation chamber and he had held his first intelligible conversation\nwith the natives that day.\n\nThe Varn was facing into the red-black gloom outside the lighted airlock, where the departing\nnatives could be heard crossing the glade. \"_Their thoughts no longer hold fear and suspicion_,\"\nit said. \"_The misunderstanding is ended._\"\n\nHe raised the muzzle of the blaster in his hand. The black head lifted and the golden eyes\nlooked up at him.\n\n\"I made you no promise,\" he said.\n\n\"_I could demand none._\"\n\n\"I can't stop to take you back to your own world and I can't leave you alive on this one--with\nwhat you've learned from my mind you would have the natives build the Varn a disintegrator-equipped\nspace fleet equal to our own ships.\"\n\n\"_We want only to go with you._\"\n\nHe told it what he wanted it to know before he killed it, wondering why he should care:\n\n\"I would like to believe you are sincere--and you know why I don't dare to. Trusting a telepathic\nrace would be too dangerous. The Varn would know everything we knew and only the Varn would\nbe able to communicate with each new alien race. We would have to believe what the Varn told\nus--we would have to trust the Varn to see for us and speak for us and not deceive us as we\nwent across the galaxy."}

They found themselves\nat the foot of a precipice, esteemed so impracticable, that only a\nslight guard of one hundred and fifty men defended it.

The troops, whom nothing\ncould discourage, for these difficulties could not, pulled themselves\nand one another up by stumps and boughs of trees.

They reciprocated his friendly greeting and moved toward the front entrance, where Wilkins was engrossed in the morning news, propped against the doorframe in his undershirt. Upon spotting them, he acknowledged their presence and, to Guly's amazement, inquired about their sleep quality. Furthermore, he acknowledged the shabby state of their room and promised to tidy it up before it was suitable for habitation."}

{"ID": 192, "text": "\nMany of them were quite innocent and as fatuous as dreams are wont to be, but even these innocent\ndreams fretted the soul of the waking man, for in every scrap and vestige of them he recognized\nthe mind of that other personality.\n\nAfter the first few days, his intellect, so severe and logical, began to lose its severity\nand logic, and to take up sides with his heart and to cry aloud against the injustice of this\npersecution.\n\nWhy should he be haunted like this? He felt no trace of remorse now for the past; the sense\nof injustice swallowed all that. Every day seemed to drive that past further off, and to increase\nthe sense of detachment from that other man and his works; yet every night a hand, like the\nhand of some remorseless chess player, put things back in their places.\n\nWith the falling of the curtain of sleep he became metamorphosed.\n\nThen came the day when the evil he was suffering from declared itself in a physical manner\nand Th\u00e9nard was called in.\n\nTh\u00e9nard found his patient in bed. His mind was quite clear, but the pupils of his eyes were\nunequal; there was numbness in the left arm and want of grip in the hand. He had been prepared\nfor the change evident in Berselius's face and manner, for Maxine had told him in a few words\nof the accident and loss of memory, and as he took his seat by the bedside he was about to\nput some questions relative to the injury, when Berselius forestalled him.\n\nBerselius knew something about medicine. He guessed the truth about his own case, and he gave\na succinct account of the accident and the loss of memory following it.\n\n\"This is due to the result of the injury, is it not?\" said Berselius, pointing to his left\narm when he had finished.\n\n\"I am afraid so,\" said TTh\u00e9nard, who knew his patient, and that plain speaking would be best.\n\n\"Some pressure?\"\n\n\"So I imagine.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be afraid of speaking out. I don't mind the worst. Will an operation remove that\npressure?\"\n\n\"If, as I imagine, there is some pressure from the inner table of the skull on the brain, it will.\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" said Berselius, \"I want you to listen to me attentively; ever since that accident,\nor, at least, since I regained memory, I have felt that I am not the same man. Only in sleep\ndo I become myself again--do you understand me? I have quite different aims and objects; my\nfeelings about things are quite different; my past before the accident is ruled off from my\npresent--that is, when I am awake.\n\n\"When I dream I become my old self again--is that not strange?\""}
{"ID": 888, "text": "Had I followed that good lady's advice, who scented the danger from\nafar off, as it were, I should never have fallen into the snare\nprepared for me; and which was laid in a way that was as successful\nas it was simple.\n\nMy Lady Lyndon's relation with me was a singular one. Her life was\npassed in a crack-brained sort of alternation between love and\nhatred for me. If I was in a good-humour with her (as occurred\nsometimes) there was nothing she would not do to propitiate me\nfurther; and she would be as absurd and violent in her expressions\nof fondness as, at other moments, she would be in her demonstrations\nof hatred. It is not your feeble easy husbands who are loved best in\nthe world; according to my experience of it. I do think the women\nlike a little violence of temper, and think no worse of a husband\nwho exercises his authority pretty smartly. I had got my Lady into\nsuch a terror about me, that when I smiled, it was quite an era of\nhappiness to her; and if I beckoned to her, she would come fawning\nup to me like a dog. I recollect how, for the few days I was at\nschool, the cowardly mean-spirited fellows would laugh if ever our\nschoolmaster made a joke. It was the same in the regiment whenever\nthe bully of a sergeant was disposed to be jocular--not a recruit\nbut was on the broad grin. Well, a wise and determined husband will\nget his wife into this condition of discipline; and I brought my\nhigh-born wife to kiss my hand, to pull off my boots, to fetch and\ncarry for me like a servant, and always to make it a holiday, too,\nwhen I was in good-humour. I confided perhaps too much in the\nduration of this disciplined obedience, and forgot that the very\nhypocrisy which forms a part of it (all timid people are liars in\ntheir hearts) may be exerted in a way that may be far from\nagreeable, in order to deceive you.\n\nAfter the ill-success of her last adventure, which gave me endless\nopportunities to banter her, one would have thought I might have\nbeen on my guard as to what her real intentions were; but she\nmanaged to mislead me with an art of dissimulation quite admirable,\nand lulled me into a fatal security with regard to her intentions:\nfor, one day, as I was joking her, and asking her whether she would\ntake the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so\nforth, she suddenly burst into tears, and, seizing hold of my hand,\ncried passionately out,--\n\n'Ah, Barry, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!\nWas I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me\nhappy! ever so angry, but the least offer of goodwill on your part\ndid not bring me to your side? Did I not give a sufficient proof of\nmy affection for you, in bestowing one of the first fortunes in\nEngland upon you? Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have\nwasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always\nloved you."}

{"ID": 949, "text": "\"Dost thou hear that, John?\" exclaimed Richard. \"Ladders, man--get\nladders, and to the wall. How I should delight to see thee on the\nhighest round--thy knees shaking--thy hands grasping convulsively,\nlike those of one in an ague fit--all air around thee, save a\nbaton or two of wood--the moat below--half-a-dozen pikes at thy\nthroat--\"\n\n\"Peace, Richard, for shame, if not for charity!\" said his father,\nin a tone of anger, mingled with grief. \"And thou, John, get ready\nfor the assault.\"\n\n\"As soon as I have put on my armour, father,\" answered the Prince;\nand withdrew slowly, with a visage so blank as to promise no speed\nin his preparations.\n\nHis brother laughed as he retired, and said to his squire, \"It\nwere no bad jest, Alberick, to carry the place ere John can change\nhis silk doublet for a steel one.\"\n\nSo saying, he hastily withdrew, and his father exclaimed in\npaternal distress, \"Out, alas! as much too hot as his brother is\ntoo cold; but it is the manlier fault.--Gloucester,\" said he to\nthat celebrated earl, \"take sufficient strength, and follow Prince\nRichard to guard and sustain him. If any one can rule him, it must\nbe a knight of thy established fame. Alas, alas! for what sin have\nI deserved the affliction of these cruel family feuds!\"\n\n\"Be comforted, my lord,\" said the chancellor, who was also in\nattendance.\n\n\"Speak not of comfort to a father, whose sons are at discord with\neach other, and agree only in their disobedience to him!\"\n\nThus spoke Henry the Second, than whom no wiser, or, generally\nspeaking, more fortunate monarch ever sat upon the throne of\nEngland; yet whose life is a striking illustration, how family\ndissensions can tarnish the most brilliant lot to which Heaven\npermits humanity to aspire; and how little gratified ambition,\nextended power, and the highest reputation in war and in peace,\ncan do towards curing the wounds of domestic affliction.\n\nThe sudden and fiery attack of Richard, who hastened to the\nescalade at the head of a score of followers, collected at random,\nhad the complete effect of surprise; and having surmounted the\nwalls with their ladders, before the contending parties within\nwere almost aware of the assault, the assailants burst open the\ngates, and admitted Gloucester, who had hastily followed with a\nstrong body of men-at-arms. The garrison, in their state of\nsurprise, confusion, and disunion, offered but little resistance,\nand would have been put to the sword, and the place plundered, had\nnot Henry himself entered it, and by his personal exertions and\nauthority, restrained the excesses of the dissolute soldiery.\n\nThe King conducted himself, considering the times and the\nprovocation, with laudable moderation. He contented himself with\ndisarming and dismissing the common soldiers, giving them some\ntrifle to carry them out of the country, lest want should lead\nthem to form themselves into bands of robbers. The officers were\nmore severely treated, being for the greater part thrown into\ndungeons, to abide the course of the law. In particular,\nimprisonment was the lot of Damian de Lacy, against whom,\nbelieving the various charges with which he was loaded, Henry was\nso highly incensed, that he purposed to make him an example to all\nfalse knights and disloyal subjects. To the Lady Eveline Berenger\nhe assigned her own apartment as a prison, in which she was\nhonourably attended by Rose and Alice, but guarded with the utmost\nstrictness. It was generally reported that her demesnes would be\ndeclared a forfeiture to the crown, and bestowed, at least in\npart, upon Randal de Lacy, who had done good service during the\nsiege. Her person, it was thought, was destined to the seclusion\nof some distant French nunnery, where she might at leisure repent\nher of her follies and her rashness.\n\nFather Aldrovand was delivered up to the discipline of the\nconvent, long experience having very effectually taught Henry the\nimprudence of infringing on the privileges of the church;\nalthough, when the King first beheld him with a rusty corslet\nclasped over his frock, he with difficulty repressed the desire to\ncause him to hanged over the battlements, to preach to the ravens.\n\nWith Wilkin Flammock, Henry held much conference, particularly on\nhis subject of manufactures and commerce; on which the sound-\nheaded, though blunt-spoken Fleming, was well qualified to\ninstruct an intelligent monarch. \"Thy intentions,\" he said, \"shall\nnot be forgotten, good fellow, though they have been anticipated\nby the headlong valour of my son Richard, which has cost some poor\ncaitiffs their lives--Richard loves not to sheathe a bloodless\nweapon. But thou and thy countrymen shall return to thy mills\nyonder, with a full pardon for past offences, so that you meddle\nno more with such treasonable matters.\"\n\n\"And our privileges and duties, my liege?\" said Flammock. \"Your\nMajesty knows well we are vassals to the lord of this castle, and\nmust follow him in battle.\"\n\n\"It shall no longer be so,\" said Henry; \"I will form a community\nof Flemings here, and thou, Flammock, shalt be Mayor, that thou\nmay'st not plead feudal obedience for a relapse into treason.\"\n\n\"Treason, my liege!\" said Flammock, longing, yet scarce venturing,\nto 'interpose a word in behalf of Lady Eveline, for whom, despite\nthe constitutional coolness of his temperament, he really felt\nmuch interest--\"I would that your Grace but justly knew how many\nthreads went to that woof.\"\n\n\"Peace, sirrah!--meddle with your loom,\" said Henry; \"and if we\ndeign to speak to thee concerning the mechanical arts which thou\ndost profess, take it for no warrant to intrude farther on our\nprivacy.\"\n\nThe Fleming retired, rebuked, and in silence; and the fate of the\nunhappy prisoners remained in the King's bosom. He himself took up\nhis lodging in the castle of the Garde Doloureuse, as a convenient\nstation for sending abroad parties to suppress and extinguish all\nthe embers of rebellion; and so active was Randal de Lacy on these\noccasions, that he appeared daily to rise in the King's grace, and\nwas gratified with considerable grants out of the domains of\nBerenger and Lacy, which the King seemed already to treat as\nforfeited property. Most men considered this growing favour of\nRandal as a perilous omen, both far the life of young De Lacy, and\nfor the fate of the unfortunate Eveline.\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTIETH\n\n\n   A vow, a vow--I have a vow in Heaven.\n   Shall I bring perjury upon my soul?\n   No, not for Venice.\n     MERCHANT OF VENICE.\n\n\nThe conclusion of the last chapter contains the tidings with which\nthe minstrel greeted his unhappy master, Hugo de Lacy; not indeed\nwith the same detail of circumstances with which we have been able\nto invest the narrative, but so as to infer the general and\nappalling facts, that his betrothed bride, and beloved and trusted\nkinsman, had leagued together for his dishonour--had raised the\nbanner of rebellion against their lawful sovereign, and, failing\nin their audacious attempt, had brought the life of one of them,\nat least, into the most imminent danger, and the fortunes of the\nHouse of Lacy, unless some instant remedy could be found, to the\nvery verge of ruin.\n\nVidal marked the countenance of his master as he spoke, with the\nsame keen observation which the chirurgeon gives to the progress\nof his dissecting-knife. There was grief on the Constable's\nfeatures--deep grief--but without the expression of abasement or\nprostration which usually accompanies it; anger and shame were\nthere--but they were both of a noble character, seemingly excited\nby his bride and nephew's transgressing the laws of allegiance,\nhonour, and virtue, rather than by the disgrace and damage which\nhe himself sustained through their crime.\n\nThe minstrel was so much astonished at this change of deportment,\nfrom the sensitive acuteness of agony which attended the beginning\nof his narrative, that he stepped back two paces, and gazing on\nthe Constable with wonder, mixed with admiration, exclaimed, \"We\nhave heard of martyrs in. Palestine, but this exceeds them!\"\n\n\"Wonder not so much, good friend,\" said the Constable, patiently;\n\"it is the first blow of the lance or mace which pierces or stuns\n--those which follow are little felt.\" [Footnote: Such an\nexpression is said to have been used by Mandrin, the celebrated\nsmuggler, while in the act of being broken upon the wheel. This\ndreadful punishment consists in the executioner, with a bar of\niron, breaking the shoulder-bones, arms, thigh-bones, and legs of\nthe criminal, taking--his alternate sides. The punishment is\nconcluded by a blow across the breast, called the _coup de\ngrace_, because it removes the sufferer from his agony. When\nMandrin received the second blow over the left shoulder-bone, he\nlaughed. His confessor inquired the reason of demeanour so\nunbecoming--his situation. \"I only lavish at my own folly, my\nfather,\" answered Mandrin, \"who could suppose that sensibility of\npain should continue after the nervous system had been completely\nderanged by the first blow.]\n\n\"Think, my lord,\" said Vidal, \"all is lost--love, dominion, high\noffice, and bright fame--so late a chief among nobles, now a poor\npalmer!\"\n\n\"Wouldst thou make sport with my misery?\" said Hugo, sternly; \"but\neven that comes of course behind my back, and why should it not be\nendured when said to my face?--Know, then, minstrel, and put it in\nsong if you list, that Hugo de Lacy, having lost all he carried to\nPalestine, and all which he left at home, is still lord of his own\nmind; and adversity can no more shake him, than the breeze which\nstrips the oak of its leaves can tear up the trunk by the roots.\"\n\n\"Now, by the tomb of my father,\" said the minstrel, rapturously,\n\"this man's nobleness is too much for my resolve!\" and stepping\nhastily to the Constable, he kneeled on one knee, and caught his\nhand more freely than the state maintained by men of De Lacy's\nrank usually permitted. \"Here,\" said Vidal, \"on this hand--this\nnoble hand--I renounce--\" But ere he could utter another word,\nHugo de Lacy, who, perhaps, felt the freedom of the action as an\nintrusion on his fallen condition, pulled back his hand, and bid\nthe minstrel, with as stern frown, arise, and remember that\nmisfortune made not De Lacy a fit personage for a mummery.\n\nRenault Vidal rose rebuked. \"I had forgot,\" he said, \"the distance\nbetween an Armorican violer and a high Norman baron. I thought\nthat the same depth of sorrow, the same burst of joy, levelled,\nfor a moment at least, those artificial barriers by which men are\ndivided. But it is well as it is. Live within the limits of your\nrank, as heretofore within your donjon tower and your fosses, my\nlord, undisturbed by the sympathy of any mean man like me. I, too,\nhave my duties to discharge.\"\n\n\"And now to the Garde Doloureuse,\" said the baron, turning to\nPhilip Guarine--\"God knoweth how well it deserveth the name!--\nthere to learn, with our own eyes and ears, the truth of these\nwoful tidings. Dismount, minstrel, and give me thy palfrey--I\nwould, Guarine, that I had one for thee--as for Vidal, his\nattendance is less necessary. I will face my foes, or my\nmisfortunes, like a man--that be assured of, violer; and look not\nso sullen, knave--I will not forget old adherents.\"\n\n\"One of them, at least, will not forget you, my lord,\" replied the\nminstrel, with his usual dubious tone of look and emphasis.\n\nBut just as the Constable was about to prick forwards, two persons\nappeared on the path, mounted on one horse, who, hidden by some\ndwarf-wood, had come very near them without being perceived. They\nwere male and female; and the man, who rode foremost, was such a\npicture of famine, as the eyes of the pilgrims had scarce\nwitnessed in all the wasted land through which they had travelled.\nHis features, naturally sharp and thin, had disappeared almost\nentirely among the uncombed gray beard and hairs with which they\nwere overshadowed; and it was but the glimpse of a long nose, that\nseemed as sharp as the edge of a knife, and the twinkling glimpse\nof his gray eyes, which gave any intimation of his lineaments. His\nleg, in the wide old boot which enclosed it, looked like the\nhandle of a mop left by chance in a pail--his arms were about the\nthickness of riding-rods--and such parts of his person as were not\nconcealed by the tatters of a huntsman's cassock, seemed rather\nthe appendages of a mummy than a live man.\n\nThe female who sat behind this spectre exhibited also some\nsymptoms of extenuation; but being a brave jolly dame naturally,\nfamine had not been able to render her a spectacle so rueful as\nthe anatomy behind which she rode. Dame Gillian's cheek (for it\nwas the reader's old acquaintance) had indeed lost the rosy hue of\ngood cheer, and the smoothness of complexion which art and easy\nliving had formerly substituted for the more delicate bloom of\nyouth; her eyes were sunken, and had lost much of their bold and\nroguish lustre; but she was still in some measure herself, and the\nremnants of former finery, together with the tight-drawn scarlet\nhose, though sorely faded, showed still a remnant of coquettish\npretension.\n\nSo soon as she came within sight of the pilgrims, she began to\npunch Raoul with the end of her riding-rod. \"Try thy new trade,\nman, since thou art unfit for any other--to the good man--to them\n--crave their charity.\"\n\n\"Beg from beggars?\" muttered Raoul; \"that were hawking at\nsparrows, dame.\"\n\n\"It will bring our hand in use though,\" said Gillian; and\ncommenced, in a whining tone, \"God love you, holy men, who have\nhad the grace to go to the Holy Land, and, what is more, have had\nthe grace to come back again; I pray, bestow some of your alms\nupon my poor old husband, who is a miserable object, as you see,\nand upon one who has the bad luck to be his wife--Heaven help me!\"\n\n\"Peace, woman, and hear what I have to say,\" said the Constable,\nlaying his hand upon the bridle of the horse--\"I have present\noccasion for that horse, and----\"\n\n\"By the hunting-horn of St. Hubert, but thou gettest him not\nwithout blows!\" answered the old huntsman \"A fine world it is,\nwhen palmers turn horse-stealers.\"\n\n\"Peace, fellow\" said the Constable, sternly,--\"I say I have\noccasion presently for the service of thy horse. Here be two gold\nbezants for a day's use of the brute; it is well worth the\nfee-simple of him, were he never returned.\"\n\n\"But the palfrey is an old acquaintance, master,\" said Raoul; \"and\nif perchance--\"\n\n\"Out upon _if_ and _perchance_ both,\" said the dame,\ngiving her husband so determined a thrust as well-nigh pushed him\nout of the saddle. \"Off the horse! and thank God and this worthy\nman for the help he hath sent us in this extremity. What signifies\nthe palfrey, when we have not enough to get food either for the\nbrute or ourselves? not though we would eat grass and corn with\nhim, like King Somebody, whom the good father used to read us to\nsleep about.\"\n\n\"A truce with your prating, dame,\" said Raoul, offering his\nassistance to help her from the croupe; but she preferred that of\nGuarine, who, though advanced in years, retained the advantage of\nhis stout soldierly figure. \"I humbly thank your goodness,\" said\nshe, as, (having first kissed her,) the squire set her on the\nground. \"And, pray, sir, are ye come from the Holy Land?--Heard ye\nany tidings there of him that was Constable of Chester?\"\n\nDe Lacy, who was engaged in removing the pillion from behind the\nsaddle, stopped short in his task, and said, \"Ha, dame! what would\nyou with him?\"\n\n\"A great deal, good palmer, an I could light on him; for his lands\nand offices are all to be given, it's like, to that false thief,\nhis kinsman.\"\n\n\"What!--to Damian, his nephew?\" exclaimed the Constable, in a\nharsh and hasty tone.\n\n\"Lord, how you startle me, sir!\" said Gillian; then continued,\nturning to Philip Guarine, \"Your friend is a hasty man, belike.\";\n\n\"It is the fault of the sun he has lived under so long,\" said the\nsquire; \"but look you answer his questions truly, and he will make\nit the better for you.\"\n\nGillian instantly took the hint. \"Was it Damian de Lacy you asked\nafter?--Alas I poor young gentleman! no offices or lands for him--\nmore likely to have a gallows-cast, poor lad--and all for nought,\nas I am a true dame. Damian!--no, no, it is not Damian, or damson\nneither--but Randal Lacy, that must rule the roast, and have all\nthe old man's lands, and livings, and lordships.\"\n\n\"What?\" said the Constable--\"before they know whether the old man.\nis dead or no?-Methinks that were against law and reason both.\"\n\n\"Ay, but Randal Lacy has brought about less likely matters. Look\nyou, he hath sworn to the King that they have true tidings of the\nConstable's death--ay, and let him alone to make them soothfast\nenough, if the Constable were once within his danger.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the Constable. \"But you are forging tales on a\nnoble gentleman. Come, come, dame, you say this because you like\nnot Randal Lacy.\"\n\n\"Like him not!--And what reason have I to like him, I trow?\"\nanswered Gillian. \"Is it because he seduced my simplicity to let\nhim into the castle of the Garde Doloureuse-ay, oftener than once\nor twice either,-when he was disguised as a pedlar, and told him\nall the secrets of the family, and how the boy Damian, and the\ngirl Eveline, were dying of love with each other, but had not\ncourage to say a word of it, for fear of the Constable, though he\nwere a thousand miles off?-You seem concerned, worthy sir--may I\noffer your reverend worship a trifling sup from my bottle, which\nis sovereign for _tremor cordis_, and fits of the spleen?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" ejaculated De Lacy--\"I was but grieved with the shooting\nof an old wound. But, dame, I warrant me this Damian and Eveline,\nas you call them, became better, closer friends, in time?\"\n\n\"They?--not they indeed, poor simpletons!\" answered the dame;\n\"they wanted some wise counsellor to go between and advise them.\nFor, look you, sir, if old Hugo be dead, as is most like, it were\nmore natural that his bride and his nephew should inherit his\nlands, than this same Randal who is but a distant kinsman, and a\nforesworn caitiff to boot.--Would you think it, reverend pilgrim,\nafter the mountains of gold he promised me?--when the castle was\ntaken, and he saw I could serve him no more, he called me old\nbeldame, and spoke of the beadle and the cucking-stool.--Yes,\nreverend sir, old beldame and cucking-stool were his best words,\nwhen he knew I had no one to take my part, save old Raoul, who\ncannot take his own. But if grim old Hugh bring back his\nweatherbeaten carcass from Palestine, and have but half the devil\nin him which he had when he was fool enough to go away, Saint\nMary, but I will do his kinsman's office to him!\"\n\nThere was a pause when she had done speaking.\n\n\"Thou say'st,\" at length exclaimed the Constable, \"that Damian de\nLacy and Eveline love each other, yet are unconscious of guilt or\nfalsehood, or ingratitude to me--I would say, to their relative in\nPalestine!\"\n\n\"Love, sir!--in troth and so it is--they do love each other,\" said\nGillian; \"but it is like angels--or like lambs--or like fools, if\nyou will; for they would never so much as have spoken together,\nbut for a prank of that same Randal Lacy's.\"\n\n\"How!\" demanded the Constable--\"a prank of Randal's?--What motive\nhad he that these two should meet?\"\n\n\"Nay, their meeting was none of his seeking; but he had formed a\nplan to carry off the Lady Eveline himself, for he was a wild\nrover, this same Randal; and so he came disguised as a merchant of\nfalcons, and trained out my old stupid Raoul, and the Lady\nEveline, and all of us, as if to have an hour's mirth in hawking\nat the heron. But he had a band of Welsh kites in readiness to\npounce upon us; and but for the sudden making in of Damian to our\nrescue, it is undescribable to think what might have come of us;\nand Damian being hurt in the onslaught, was carried to the Garde\nDoloureuse in mere necessity; and but to save his life, it is my\nbelief my lady would never have asked him to cross the drawbridge,\neven if he had offered.\"\n\n\"Woman,\" said the Constable, \"think what thou say'st! If thou hast\ndone evil in these matters heretofore, as I suspect from thine own\nstory, think not to put it right by a train of new falsehoods,\nmerely from spite at missing thy reward.\"\n\n\"Palmer,\" said old Raoul, with his broken-toned voice, cracked by\nmany a hollo, \"I am wont to leave the business of tale-bearing to\nmy wife Gillian, who will tongue-pad it with any shrew in\nChristendom. But thou speak'st like one having some interest in\nthese matters, and therefore I will tell thee plainly, that\nalthough this woman has published her own shame in avowing her\ncorrespondence with that same Randal Lacy, yet what she has said\nis true as the gospel; and, were it my last word, I would say that\nDamian and the Lady Eveline are innocent of all treason and all\ndishonesty, as is the babe unborn.--But what avails what the like\nof us say, who are even driven to the very begging for mere\nsupport, after having lived at a good house, and in a good lord's\nservice-blessing be with him!\"\n\n\"But hark you,\" continued the Constable, \"are there left no\nancient servants of the House, that could speak out as well as\nyou?\" \"Humph!\" answered the huntsman--\"men are not willing to\nbabble when Randal Lacy is cracking his thong above their heads.\nMany are slain, or starved to death--some disposed of--some\nspirited away. But there are the weaver Flammock and his daughter\nRose, who know as much of the matter as we do.\"\n\n\"What!--Wilkin Flammock the stout Netherlander?\" said the\nConstable; \"he and his blunt but true daughter Rose?--I will\nventure my life on their faith. Where dwell they?--What has been\ntheir lot amidst these changes?\" \"And in God's name who are you\nthat ask these questions?\" said Dame Gillian. \"Husband, husband--\nwe have been too free; there is something in that look and that\ntone which I should remember.\"\n\n\"Yes, look at me more fixedly,\" said the Constable, throwing \"back\nthe hood which had hitherto in some degree obscured his features.\n\n\"On your knees--on your knees, Raoul!\" exclaimed Gillian, dropping\non her own at the same time; \"it is the Constable himself, and he\nhas heard me call him old Hugh!\"\n\n\"It is all that is left of him who was the Constable, at least,\"\nreplied De Lacy; \"and old Hugh willingly forgives your freedom, in\nconsideration of your good news. Where are Flammock and his\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"Rose is with the Lady Eveline,\" said Dame Gillian; \"her ladyship,\nbelike, chose her for bower-woman in place of me, although Rose\nwas never fit to attire so much as a Dutch doll.\"\n\n\"The faithful girl!\" said the Constable. \"And where is Flammock?\"\n\n\"Oh, for him, he has pardon and favour from the King,\" said Raoul;\n\"and is at his own house, with his rabble of weavers, close beside\nthe Battle-bridge, as they now call the place where your lordship\nquelled the Welsh.\"\n\n\"Thither will I then,\" said the Constable; \"and will then see what\nwelcome King Henry of Anjou has for an old servant. You two must\naccompany me.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said Gillian, with hesitation, \"you know poor folk are\nlittle thanked for interference with great men's affairs. I trust\nyour lordship will be able to protect us if we speak the truth;\nand that you will not look back with displeasure on what I did,\nacting for the best.\"\n\n\"Peace, dame, with a wanion to ye!\" said Raoul. \"Will you think of\nyour own old sinful carcass, when you should be saving your sweet\nyoung mistress from shame and oppression?--And for thy ill tongue,\nand worse practices, his lordship knows they are bred in the bone\nof thee.\"\n\n\"Peace, good fellow!\" said the Constable; \"we will not look back\non thy wife's errors, and your fidelity shall be rewarded.--For\nyou, my faithful followers,\" he said, turning towards Guarine and\nVidal, \"when De Lacy shall receive his rights, of which he doubts\nnothing, his first wish shall be to reward your fidelity.\"\n\n\"Mine, such as it is, has been and shall be its own reward,\" said\nVidal. \"I will not accept favours from him in prosperity, who, in\nadversity, refused me his hand--our account stands yet open.\"\n\n\"Go to, thou art a fool; but thy profession hath a privilege to be\nhumorous,\" said the Constable, whose weatherbeaten and homely\nfeatures looked even handsome, when animated by gratitude to\nHeaven and benevolence towards mankind. \"We will meet,\" he said,\n\"at Battle-bridge, an hour before vespers--I shall have much\nachieved before that time.\"\n\n\"The space is short,\" said his esquire.\n\n\"I have won a battle in yet shorter,\" replied the Constable.\n\n\n\"In which,\" said the minstrel, \"many a man has died that thought\nhimself well assured of life and victory.\"\n\n\"Even so shall my dangerous cousin Randal find his schemes of\nambition blighted,\" answered the Constable; and rode forwards,\naccompanied by Raoul and his wife, who had remounted their\npalfrey, while the minstrel and squire followed a-foot, and, of\ncourse, much more slowly.\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST\n\n\n   \"Oh, fear not, fear not, good Lord John,\n   That I would you betray,\n   Or sue requital for a debt,\n   Which nature cannot pay.\n   Bear witness, all ye sacred powers--\n   Ye lights that 'gin to shine--\n   This night shall prove the sacred tie\n   That binds your faith and mine.\"\n     ANCIENT SCOTTISH BALLAD."}

At last, however,\nhe gave expression to his thoughts. \"You know, Abbe, what will be said if the Pope should die\nthis time.

And remark this: in no city, I believe, are sudden deaths\nso frequent. The causes I don't exactly know, but some doctors put everything down to the fevers.\nAmong the people, however, the one thought is poison, poison with all its legends, poison which\nkills like lightning and leaves no trace, the famous recipe bequeathed from age to age, through\nthe emperors and the popes, down to these present times of middle-class democracy.\"\n\nAs he spoke he ended by smiling, for he was inclined to be somewhat sceptical on the point,\ndespite the covert terror with which he was inspired by racial and educational causes. However,\nhe quoted instances. The Roman matrons had rid themselves of their husbands and lovers by employing\nthe venom of red toads. Locusta, in a more practical spirit, sought poison in plants, one of\nwhich, probably aconite, she was wont to boil. Then, long afterwards, came the age of the Borgias,\nand subsequently, at Naples, La Toffana sold a famous water, doubtless some preparation of\narsenic, in phials decorated with a representation of St. Nicholas of Bari.

DEACON BAXTER'S WIVES\n\nFOXWELL BAXTER was ordinarily called \"Old Foxy\" by the boys of the\ndistrict, and also, it is to be feared, by the men gathered for evening\nconference at the various taverns, or at one of the rival village\nstores.\n\nHe had a small farm of fifteen or twenty acres, with a pasture, a wood\nlot, and a hay-field, but the principal source of his income came\nfrom trading. His sign bore the usual legend: \"WEST INDIA GOODS AND\nGROCERIES,\" and probably the most profitable articles in his stock were\nrum, molasses, sugar, and tobacco; but there were chests of rice, tea,\ncoffee, and spices, barrels of pork in brine, as well as piles of cotton\nand woolen cloth on the shelves above the counters. His shop window,\nseldom dusted or set in order, held a few clay pipes, some glass jars of\npeppermint or sassafras lozenges, black licorice, stick-candy, and sugar\ngooseberries. These dainties were seldom renewed, for it was only a very\nbold child, or one with an ungovernable appetite for sweets, who would\nhave spent his penny at Foxy Baxter's store.\n\nHe was thought a sharp and shrewd trader, but his honesty was never\nquestioned; indeed, the only trait in his character that ever came up\nfor general discussion was his extraordinary, unbelievable, colossal\nmeanness. This so eclipsed every other passion in the man, and loomed\nso bulkily and insistently in the foreground, that had he cherished a\nsecond vice no one would have observed it, and if he really did possess\na casual virtue, it could scarcely have reared its head in such ugly\ncompany.\n\nIt might be said, to defend the fair name of the Church, that Mr.\nBaxter's deaconhood did not include very active service in the courts of\nthe Lord. He had \"experienced religion\" at fifteen and made profession\nof his faith, but all well-brought-up boys and girls did the same\nin those days; their parents saw to that! If change of conviction or\nbacksliding occurred later on, that was not their business! At the\nripe age of twenty-five he was selected to fill a vacancy and became a\ndeacon, thinking it might be good for trade, as it was, for some years.\nHe was very active at the time of the \"Cochrane craze,\" since any\ndefence of the creed that included lively detective work and incessant\nspying on his neighbors was particularly in his line; but for many years\nnow, though he had been regular in attendance at church, he had never\nofficiated at communion, and his diaconal services had gradually lapsed\ninto the passing of the contribution-box, a task of which he never\nwearied; it was such a keen pleasure to make other people yield their\npennies for a good cause, without adding any of his own!"}

It must be kept upright, alert, wakeful. What\nwe desire is a body so poised and at rest that it is content to sit\nthere, taking care of itself, and we can forget it.\n\nStill the mind, gather it, turn it steadfastly towards God. This is more\ndifficult. It is contrary to the mind's nature to be still. It is\nagainst its grain to turn Godwards. Left to itself it goes on and on\nunder its own momentum, roaming, wandering. It thinks and pictures and\ndreams of everything on earth except God and the practice of His\npresence. Even those who developed great aptitude for taking hold of the\nmind and turning it to God found it difficult and even painful in the\nbeginning. If we expect it to be easy and pleasant we shall be easily\ndiscouraged after a few trials. Brother Lawrence warns us that this\npractice may even seem repugnant to us at first.\n\nThe mind of an adult is more restive and all over the place than the\nbody of a child. How are we to curb its incessant restlessness and stay\nit upon prayer and worship? How restrain its wanderings and point it to\nthe mark? How take it away from its automatic stream of thoughts and\nfocus it on God? Only by effort, practice, repeated effort, regular\npractice. It requires life-long preparation and training. We cannot hope\nto make much progress if we attempt to stay the mind only on First-days\nduring meeting. We must make effort throughout the week, daily, hourly.\n\nIt is by stilling the body-mind that we center down. Put the other way,\nit is by centering down that we still the body-mind. I would judge that\nall Friends have in common the practice of centering down. This is our\ncommon preparation for worship. From here on, however, each of us is\nlikely to go his individual way, no two ways being alike. This is the\nfreedom of worship which has ever been an integral part of the Friends\nreligion. We are not called upon to follow any fixed procedure. This is\ncreative. The individual spirit is set free to find its way, in its own\nmanner, to God.

{"ID": 157, "text": "She was determined to confront whatever was on the other side. I followed close behind as she flung open the door, only to find nothing there but darkness and silence. Frances stood there for a moment, listening intently, then closed the door quietly and turned to face me.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Bill,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"I had to know.\"\n\nI shook my head, not quite understanding. \"Know what?\"\n\nShe looked at me, her eyes full of a strange mixture of fear and excitement. \"That we're not alone here. That there are forces at work beyond what we can see or understand. And that we're a part of it, whether we want to be or not.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. Part of me wanted to dismiss it as nonsense, but there was something in Frances' tone that made it impossible to do so. Instead, I simply nodded and said, \"Let's pack our bags and get out of here.\"\n\nAs we made our way through the darkened house, I couldn't help but feel as though we were being watched. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of the curtains, seemed to be a sign of some malevolent presence lurking just out of sight. It was a relief to finally step out into the crisp night air and make our way to the waiting carriage.\n\nAs we rode away from the house, I couldn't help but look back at it one last time. It loomed there in the darkness, a silent sentinel of all the horrors we had experienced within its walls. And yet, even as I left it behind, I knew that it would stay with me always, a haunting reminder of the things we cannot explain, and the forces that move unseen in the world around us.Instead of relying on my own instincts, I followed my sister's lead as it seemed more trustworthy. With a useless pistol in my pocket and overwhelming embarrassment, I whispered to Frances to stay close to me as a figure emerged in the corridor. We swiftly grabbed Mabel before she could be caught by someone else. However, as we carried her to her bedroom, her body went limp as if she were dead, and she continued to uncontrollably grind her teeth. Despite Frances' competence in handling the situation, I stayed vigilant in the hallway in case of any emergencies. The morning after, my sister left a note reassuring me that things have returned to normal and there was no need to bring up the previous night's events. Though I desperately wanted to leave, we stayed for the remainder of our trip without incident.There was no clear sequence of events, no cause and effect, no climactic moment. The environment around me seemed to sway and move like a loose curtain in the wind, with no apparent reason or meaning. A writer could mold this peculiar material into a story, but it would not be true.\n\nNothing significant happened, although I found myself increasingly anxious and on edge. I was always searching for something that would require me to escape, but no such event occurred. I slept lightly and surveyed the house for any sign of something ominous. But everything remained quiet, and the door locked.\n\nThe Noise, which I had feared the most, did not return. It remained hidden in the abyss from which it had arisen twice before. However, the reason for its absence plagued me even worse, and I tried to deny it existed.\n\nDespite my best efforts, sinister details began to reveal themselves. I had developed a protective barrier that had crumbled, leaving me vulnerable to Terror, which crept through the gaping fissures.\n\nFrances, my sister, remained secretive and cautious, while Mabel was still absent. The daily routines remained the same, and the ugliness of the surroundings and the oppressive silence made me feel trapped. The only reminder that happiness and beauty existed was the sight of the robins, free and joyful.\n\nI spent most of my time writing, but it only served to stir up more thoughts and fears. I tried to read, but it only added to my already overflowing mind. My only defense was deliberate resistance.\n\nWalking outdoors was not an option, as I needed to remain close to Frances. My mind was assailed with interpretations and layers, each one slipping in turn, and lodging in my thoughts. They stirred ancestral moods in me, and I found myself imagining the Inquisition pacing the empty corridors, setting up ghastly apparatus in the halls or seeking comfort in confession.\n\nIn the end, I felt trapped and vulnerable, always searching for a way out.I felt bitter and unforgiving towards those who held differing beliefs during a particular mood. I had a dream where a herd of centaurs came to destroy my house, only to wake up to the sound of horses outside my window. However, the incident with the tree was the most peculiar. Outside my window stood a giant wellingtonia on the lawn that resembled a towering, solemn image with rustling branches and a forbidding air. One night, I saw a brother wellingtonia rise beside it, revealing a gross, odious quality similar to my sister's paintings. I got the impression that the rest of the trees were equally similar and had moved closer to my window. The behavior of the doors, opening and shutting on their own accord, produced a feeling of constant invisible presence in the house. The incident with the coachman's children in the rose garden showed how vividly the intuitive child mind received the impression of what was in the air. A little girl was fastened to a rustic seat while two boys gathered sticks under the climbing rose trees, and the fear in her eyes was very genuine.Despite my attempts to comfort her, the girl ran away as if her life was in danger. I deduced that some boys had been cruel to her, most likely through thoughtlessness. I decided to confront the boys and discovered they had been playing a game where they wanted the girl to believe what they believed. They were going to burn her as a punishment for not complying. Despite my admonitions, the boys did not seem convinced that what they had done was wrong. I was overwhelmed with pity and distress, and a range of emotions surged over me like a diver ascending through layers of water with different temperatures. The incident with the children opened me up, and I felt a rush of sensations from the surrounding environment. My disgust and loathing reached their zenith, prompting me to leave the house immediately. To my delight, I learned that the house was to be sold or leased by a community organization. Although I was curious about this association and its teachings, I was relieved that we could leave without any hesitation.My sister pulled me towards her room, shutting the door behind us after I had taken a good look at the visitor. In that short moment, I had already formed an impression of him. His demeanor exuded strength and tranquility, and his confident gaze emanated reassurance. I instinctively felt that he was the kind of person one could turn to in times of crisis. This sentiment was reinforced later when I saw him walking down the corridor. His voice was also deep and gentle but firm. I wondered if I suddenly possessed a heightened sensitivity to people's auras. Sitting in the room, I felt a sense of peace that had eluded me ever since arriving at The Towers. My sister confirmed that the man was a leader in the Movement, and although he had not explained his beliefs to her, his presence left a positive impression on her. However, my sister also mentioned that Mabel, one of our acquaintances, had embraced his beliefs and viewed them as her salvation. I did not fully comprehend the details of his philosophy, but I was open to understanding it better."}

They have found, for instance, that\ngreen is restful to the eyes, and the fact goes without saying, in a\nhint, in a mere word. They are aware that heat is more disagreeable\nwhen accompanied by a high degree of humidity, and do not put forth\nthis axiom as a sensational discovery. They have noticed the\ncoincidences known as mental telepathy usual in correspondence, and\nhave long ceased to be more than mildly amused at the occurrence of the\nphenomenon. They do not speak in awe-struck voices of supernatural\napparitions, for of all fiction the ghost story is most apt to be\nbromidic, nor do they expect others to be impressed by their strange\ndreams any more than with their pathological symptoms. Hypnotism, they\nare convinced, has attained the standing of a science whose rationale\nis pretty well understood and established, and the subject is no longer\nan affording subject for anecdote. Sulphites can even listen to tales\nof Oriental magic, miraculously-growing trees, disappearing boys and\nwhat-not, without suggesting that the audience was mesmerized. Above\nall, the Sulphite recognizes as a principle that, if a story is really\nfunny, it is probably untrue, and he does not seek to give an adjuvant\nrelish to it, by dilating with verisimilitude upon the authenticity of\nthe facts in the case. But your Bromide is impressive and asserts, \"I\nknew the man that died!\" The Sulphite, too, has little need for\neuphemisms. He can speak of birth and death without metaphor.\n\nBut to the Bromide all such matters of fact and fancy are perpetually\npicturesque, and, a discoverer, he leaps up and shouts out\nenthusiastically that two and two are four, and defends his statement\nwith eloquent logic. Each scene, each incident has its magic\nspell--like the little woolly toy lamb, he presses the fact, and\n\"_ba--ba_\" the appropriate sentiment comes forth. Does he have,\nback in the shadows of his mind, perhaps, the ghost of a perception\nthat the thing has been said before? Who can tell! But, if he does,\nhis vanity exorcises the spirit. Bromides seldom listen to one\nanother; they are content with talk for talk's sake, and so escape\nall chance of education. It is this fact, most likely, which has\nendowed the bromidiom with immortality. Never heard, it seems always\nnew, appropriate, clever.\n\nNo, it Isn't so much the things they say, as the way they say them! Do\nyou not recall the smug, confident look, the assurance of having said a\nparticularly happy thing? They come inevitably as the alarm clock; when\nthe hands of circumstance touch the hour, the bromidic remark will\nsurely go off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut, lest one make too much of this particular symptom, let us consider\na few other tendencies. The Bromide has no surprises for you. When you\nsee one enter a room, you must reconcile yourself to the inevitable. No\nhope for flashes of original thought, no illuminating, newer point of\nview, no sulphitic flashes of fancy--the steady glow of bromidic\nconversation and action is all one can hope for. He may be wise and\ngood, he may be loved and respected--but he lives inland; he puts not\nforth to sea. He is there when you want him, always the same.\n\nBromides also enjoy pathological symptoms. They are fond of describing\nsickness and death-bed scenes. \"His face swelled up to twice its\nnatural size!\" they say, in awed whispers. They attend funerals with\ninterest and scrutiny.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe are all born with certain bromidic tendencies, and children are the\ngreatest bromides in the world. What boy of ten will wear a collar\ndifferent from what his school-mates are all wearing? He must conform\nto the rule and custom of the majority or he suffers fearfully. But, if\nhe has a sulphitic leaven in his soul, adolescence frees him from the\ntyrannical traditions of thought. In costume, perhaps, men still are\nmore bromidic than women. A man has, for choice, a narrow range in\ngarments--for everyday wear at most but four coats, three collars and\ntwo pairs of shoes.\n\nFewer women become Sulphites. The confession is ungallant and painful,\nbut it must be made. We have only to watch them, to listen--and to\npity.\n\nBut stay! If there is anything in heredity, women should be most\nsulphitic. For of all Bromides Adam was the progenitor, while Eve was a\nSulphite from the first!\n\nAlice in Wonderland, however, is the modern type--a Bromide amidst\nSulphites.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat, then, is a Sulphite? Ah, that is harder to define. A Sulphite is\na person who does his own thinking, he is a person who has surprises up\nhis sleeve. He is explosive. One can never foresee what he will do,\nexcept that it will be a direct and spontaneous manifestation of his\nown personality.\n\nYou cannot tell them by the looks. Sulphites come together like drops\nof mercury, in this bromidic world. Unknown, unsuspected groups of them\nare scattered over the earth, and we never know where we are going to\nmeet them--like fireflies in Summer, like Americans in Europe. The\nBromide we have always with us, predicating the obvious. The Sulphite\nappears uncalled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut you must not jump to the conclusion that all Sulphites are\nagreeable company. This is no classification as of desirable and\nundesirable people. The Sulphite, from his very nature, must\ncontinually surprise you by an unexpected course of action. He must\nexplode. You never know what he will say or do. He is always sulphitic,\nbut as often impossible. He will not bore you, but he may shock you.\nYou find yourself watching him to see what is coming next, and it may\nbe a subtle jest, a paradox, or an atrocious violation of etiquette.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll cranks, all reformers, and most artists are sulphitic. The insane\nasylums are full of Sulphites. They not only do ordinary things in\nunusual ways, but they do unusual things in ordinary ways. What is more\nintensely sulphitic than, when you have said your farewells, to go\nimmediately? Or, as you swim out to rescue a drowning girl, to keep\nyour pipe burning, all the while? They do not attempt to \"entertain\"\nyou, but let you choose your own pastime. When they present a gift, it\nhas either rhyme or reason to it. Their letters are not passed about to\nbe read by the family.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHamlet was a Sulphite; Polonius a Bromide. Becky Sharp was sulphitic;\nAmelia Sedley bromidic. So we might follow the line of cleavage between\nthe two groups in Art, Religion and Politics. Compare, for instance,\nPresident Roosevelt with his predecessor in office--the Unexpected\nversus the sedate Thermometer of Public Opinion. Compare Bernard Shaw\nwith Marie Corelli--one would swear that their very brains were\ndifferently colored! Their epigrams and platitudes are merely the\nsymptoms of different methods of thought. One need not consult one's\nprejudice, affection or taste--the Sulphitic Theory explains without\neither condemning or approving. The leopard cannot change his spots.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut if, along with these contrasts, we take, for example, Lewis Carroll\nas opposed to Dr. Johnson, we are brought up against an extraordinary\ninconsistency. It is, however, only an apparent paradox--beneath it\nlies a vital principle. Dr. Johnson was, himself, a Sulphite of the\nSulphites, but how intensely bromidic were his writings! One yawns to\nthink of them. As for Lewis Carroll, in his classic nonsense, so\nsulphitic as often to be accused by Bromides of having a secret\nmeaning, his private life was that of a Bromide. Read his biography and\nlearn the terrors of his formal, set entertainments to the little girls\nwhom he patronized! They knew what to expect of him, and he never,\nhowever agreeably, disappointed them. No, unfortunately a Sulphite does\nnot always produce sulphitic art. How many writers we know who are more\ninteresting than their work! How many who are infinitely less so! Your\nprofessional humorist is usually a dull, melancholy fellow in his\nprivate life--and a clergyman may preach infant damnation and be a\nmerry father at home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch considerations point inevitably to the truth that our theory\ndepends essentially not upon action or talk, but upon the quality and\nrationale of thought. It is a question of Potentiality, rather than of\nDynamics. It is the process of reasoning which concerns us, not its\ntranslation into conduct. A man may be a devoted supporter of Mrs.\nGrundy and yet be a Sulphite, if he has, in his own mind, reached an\noriginal conclusion that society needs her safeguards. He may be the\nwildest-eyed of Anarchists and yet bromidic, if he has accepted\nanother's reasons and swallowed the propaganda whole.\n\nIt will be doubtless through a misconception of this principle that the\nfirst schism in the Sulphitic Theory arises. Already the cult has\nbecome so important that a newer heretic sect threatens it. These\nprotestants cannot believe that there is a definite line to be drawn\nbetween Sulphites and Bromides, and hold that one may partake of a dual\nnature. All such logic is fatuous, and founded upon a misconception of\nthe Theory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is, however, a subtlety which has perhaps had something to do\nwith confusing the neophyte. It is this: Sulphitism and Bromidism are,\nsymbolically, the two halves of a circle, and their extremes meet. One\nmay be so extremely bromidic that one becomes, at a leap, sulphitic,\nand _vice versa_. This may be easily illustrated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiss Herford's inimitable monologues, being each the apotheosis of some\ntypical Bromide--a shopgirl, a country dressmaker, a bargain-hunter and\nso on--become, through her art, intensely sulphitic. They are\nexcruciatingly funny, just because she represents types so common that\nwe recognize them instantly. Each expresses the crystallized thought of\nher particular bromidic group. Done, then, by a person who is herself a\nSulphite _par excellence_, the result is droll. \"One has,\" says\nEmerson, \"but to remove an object from its environment and instantly it\nbecomes comic.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe same thing is done less artistically every day upon the vaudeville\nstage. We love to recognize types; and what Browning said of beauty:\n\n   We're made so that we love\n   First, when we see them painted,\n   Things we have passed\n   Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see\n\ncan be easily extended to our sense of humor in caricature. A recent\nhit upon the variety stage does still more to illustrate the problem.\n\nThe \"Cherry Sisters\" aroused immense curiosity by an act so bromidic as\nto be ridiculous. Were they rank amateurs, doing their simple best, or\nwere they clever artists, simulating the awkward crudeness of country\ngirls? That was the question. In a word, were they Sulphites or\nBromides?\n\nWhat such artists have done histrionically, Hillaire Belloc has done\nexquisitely for literature in his \"Story of Manuel Burden.\" This tale,\naffecting to be a serious encomium upon a middle class British\nmerchant, shows plainly that all satire is, in its essence, a sulphitic\njuggling with bromidic topics. It is done unconsciously by many a\nsimple rhymester whose verses are bought by Sulphites and read with\nglee.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the terminology of our theory we must, therefore, include two new\nterms, describing the variation of intensity of these two different\nstates of mind. The extremes meet at the points of Nitro-Bromidism and\nHypo-Sulphitism, respectively. Intensity of Bromidism becomes, then,\nNitro-Bromidism, and we have seen how, through the artist's, or through\na Sulphite's subtle point of view, such Nitro-Bromide becomes\nimmediately sulphitic.\n\nBy a similar reasoning, a Hypo-Sulphite can, at a step, become\nbromidic. The illustration most obvious is that of insanity. We are not\nmuch amused, usually, by the quaint modes of thought exhibited by\nlunatics and madmen.\n\nIt cannot be denied, however, that their processes of thought are\nsulphitic; indeed, they are so wildly original, so fanciful, that we\nmust denominate all such crazed brains, Hypo-Sulphites. Such persons\nare so surprising that they end by having no surprises left for us. We\naccept their mania and cease to regard it; it, in a word, becomes\nbromidic. So, in their ways, are all cranks and eccentrics, all whose\nset purpose is to astonish or to shock. We end by being bored at their\nattitudes and poses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Sulphite has the true Gothic spirit; the Bromide, the impulse of\nthe classic. One wonders, relishing the impossible, manifesting himself\nin characteristic, spontaneous ways; the other delights in rule and\nrhythm, in ordered sequences, in authority and precedent, following the\nlaw. One carves the gargoyle and ogrillion, working in paths untrod,\nthe other limits himself to harmonic ratios, balanced compositions, and\nto predestined fenestration. One has a grim, _na\u00eff_, virile humor,\nthe other a dead, even beauty. One is hot, the other cold. The Dark\nAges were sulphitic--there were wild deeds then; men exploded. The\nRenaissance was essentially bromidic; Art danced in fetters, men looked\nback at the Past for inspiration and chewed the cud of Greek thought.\nFor the Sulphite, fancy; for the Bromide, imagination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom the fifteenth century on, however, the wave of Sulphitism rose\nsteadily, gradually dropping at times into little depressions of\nEuphuistic manners and intervals of \"sensibility\" but climbing, with\nthe advance of science and the emancipation of thought to an ideal--the\npersonal, original interpretation of life. The nineteenth century\nshowed curiously erratic variations of the curve. From its beginning\ntill 1815, Sulphitism was upon the increase, while from that year till\n1870 there was a sickening drop to the veriest depths of bromidic\nthought. Then the Bromide infested the earth."}

{"ID": 1225, "text": "The\nbreathing must not be forced, but enough air must be furnished to\nproduce the proper full vibrations.\n\n\nBREATH MASTERY\n\nWhat then does perfect control of the breath mean?\n\n1. Ability to fill the lungs to their capacity either quickly or\nslowly.\n\n2. Ability to breathe out as quickly or slowly as the occasion\ndemands.\n\n3. Ability to suspend inspiration, with the throat open, whether the\nlungs are full or not, and to resume the process at will without\nhaving lost any of the already inspired air.\n\n4. Ability to exhale under the same restrictions.\n\nThe above four points are common to speaking and singing, but singing\ninvolves further:\n\n5. Ability to sing and sustain the voice on an _ordinary_ breath.\n\n6. Ability to _quietly_ breathe as often as text and phrase permit.\n\n7. Ability to breathe so that the fullest inspiration _brings no\nfatigue_.\n\n8. Ability to so economize the breath that the _reserve is never\nexhausted_.\n\n9. The ability to breathe so naturally, so unobtrusively, that\n_neither breath nor lack of breath is ever suggested to the\nlistener_--this is the very perfection of the art.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBREATHING EXERCISES\n\n\nEnough has been said in the preceding chapter to make clear the\nnecessity of breath control, and to show what constitutes this control\nfor the singer--the professional breather.\n\nIf the singer's breathing is nothing but an amplification of normal,\nhealthy breathing, why dwell upon it, why not let it develop of\nitself?\n\nUnfortunately, many teachers have taken this attitude, overlooking the\nfact that, although life is dependent on normal, healthy breathing,\nsuch breathing is, in civilized communities, not the rule but the\nexception, simply because normal living is rare; the artificiality of\nmodern life forbids it. The high pressure under which most people live\ninduces mental tension together with the consequent nervous and\nmuscular tension. We are, without being conscious of it, so habituated\nto unnatural tension that automatic breathing is shallow and irregular\ninstead of being deep and rhythmic.\n\nThe task, therefore, is to reclaim a neglected birthright--natural\nbreathing--to make it habitual and amplify it.\n\n\nPRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. Breathing exercises to be invigorating and purifying demand plenty\nof fresh air.\n\n2. At first do not practise longer than ten minutes at a time, three\ntimes a day.\n\n3. Gradually lengthen the time without overdoing. When tired stop.\n\n4. The best time is before dressing in the morning, with the window\nopen. The worst time is directly after a meal.\n\n5. Maintain throughout an easy, flexible poise.\n\n6. Breathe as _deeply_ as possible without abdominal distention. The\ngreatest expansion should be felt at the lower end of the breast-bone.\n\n7. Breathe as _broadly_ as possible, expanding the sides without\ntension.\n\n8. Breathe as _high_ as possible without shoulder movement or\nstiffness.\n\n9. Use not the high breath alone, or the mid-breath, or the low\nbreath, but use the _complete_ breath.\n\n10. Breathe _rhythmically_ by counting mentally.\n\n11. Breathe _thoughtfully_ rather than mechanically.\n\n12. Do not crowd the lungs or lay stress on the mere quantity of air\nyou can inhale. The intake of breath is, for the singer, secondary to\nits control, economy, and application in song. Increase of lung\ncapacity will duly appear.\n\n13. When not singing, speaking or practising an exercise that demands\nit, _keep your mouth shut_.\n\n\nATTITUDE\n\nDress the neck and body loosely, so as to give the throat and trunk\nperfect freedom. Place the hands on the hips, so as to free the chest\nfrom the weight of the arms. Stand erect, evenly upon the balls of the\nfeet; the body straight, but not strained. Raise the back of the head\nslightly without bending the neck. This action will straighten the\nspine, place the chest forward, and bring the abdomen backward into\nits proper relation.\n\nThe great majority of people are shallow breathers, chest breathers,\nwho when told to take a \"deep breath\" do not know what is meant. It is\ntherefore necessary for them first to learn what a deep breath is, and\nthen how to take it.\n\n\nExercise I\n\nFOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT A DEEP BREATH IS\n\nBefore rising in the morning, remove your pillow and while flat on\nyour back place one hand lightly on the abdomen, the other on the\nlower ribs. Relax the whole body, giving up your whole weight to the\nbed. Inhale through the nostrils slowly, evenly, and deeply, while\nmentally counting one, two, three, four, etc. As you inhale, notice\n(_a_) the gradual expansion of the abdomen, (_b_) the side expansion\nof the lower ribs, (_c_) the rise and inflation of the chest, without\nraising the shoulders. Hold the breath while mentally counting four\n(four seconds), then suddenly let the breath go, and notice the\ncollapse of the abdomen and lower chest. Remember _the inspiration\nmust be slow and deep, the expiration sudden and complete_. Practise\nthis preliminary exercise for not more than ten minutes each morning\nfor a week. The second week hold the breath six seconds, instead of\nfour, and gradually increase the time, without overdoing.\n\nWhile, for a novice, the exercises may be taken at first in bed, this\nis but a preliminary to their practise standing in easy poise as\ndirected in the preceding section.\n\n\nExercise II\n\nSLOW INHALATION WITH SUDDEN EXPULSION\n\nInhale as in I; hold the breath four counts (seconds) or more; then\nexpel the air vigorously in one breath through the wide open mouth.\nThe beginner is often helped in acquiring a deep breath by slowly\nsipping breath. Therefore as a variant to Exercise II practise:\n\n\nExercise III\n\nSIPPING THE BREATH, WITH QUICK EXHALATION\n\nThrough the smallest possible opening of the lips, while mentally\ncounting, inhale very slowly and steadily; hold two to four counts,\nthen expel the air all at once through the wide open mouth.\n\n\nExercise IV\n\nFOR RIB EXPANSION\n\nTo more completely arouse dormant muscles that should play an\nimportant part in breathing, place the hands against the sides, thumbs\nwell back, take, through the nostrils or the slightly parted lips,\nsix short catch-breaths, moving the ribs _out at the side_ with each\ncatch-breath. Hold the breath two counts, and exhale through the mouth\nwith six short expiratory puffs, drawing the ribs _in at the side_\nwith each puff.\n\n\nExercise V\n\nSLOW INHALATION WITH SLOW EXPIRATION\n\nInhale as in I, while mentally counting one, two, three, four, etc.,\nuntil the inhalation seems complete. Hold the breath four or more\ncounts; then exhale through the nostrils slowly and evenly while\nmentally counting to the number reached in the inspiration. With\npractice the number of counts will gradually increase. Do not,\nhowever, force the increase. The muscles that control inspiration are\npowerful; do not, therefore, make the mistake of seeking to control\nexpiration by contraction of the glottis. Practise these exercises\nwith an open throat and depend on the breathing muscles for control of\nthe outgoing air. Remember that _singing is control of breath in\nexit_.\n\n\nExercise VI\n\nRAPID INSPIRATION WITH SLOW EXPIRATION\n\nInhale through the nostrils quickly, deeply, and forcefully (one\ncount); hold two counts; exhale through the nostrils evenly, steadily,\nand as slowly as possible while mentally counting one, two, three,\nfour, etc. With practice gradually increase the number of counts for\nthe exhalation.\n\n\nExercise VII\n\nFARINELLI'S GREAT EXERCISE\n\nThe Cavalier, Don Carlo Broschi, better known as Farinelli\n(1705-1782), the world's greatest singer in bravura and coloratura,\nwas a pupil of Porpora and Bernacchi. There was no branch of the art\nwhich he did not carry to the highest perfection, and the successes of\nhis youth did not prevent him from continuing his study, or, when his\nname was famous, from acquiring by much perseverance another style\nand a superior method. His breath control was considered so marvelous\nin that day of great singers, it is said, that the art of taking and\nkeeping the breath so softly and easily that no one could perceive it\nbegan and died with him. He is said to have spent several hours daily\nin practising the following exercise:\n\nAs in Exercise III, sip the breath slowly and steadily through the\nsmallest possible opening of the lips; hold it a few counts, then\nexhale very slowly and steadily through the smallest possible opening\nof the lips.\n\nFarinelli's exercise is not for beginners.\n\n\nExercise VIII\n\nTHE CLEANSING BREATH\n\nFor ventilating and sweeping the lungs, for quick refreshment after\nfatigue, and for use always at the close of your exercises, inhale\nthrough the nostrils slowly a complete breath; hold two to four\ncounts, purse the lips tightly and expel through them a small puff of\nair, hold two counts, puff one, hold two counts, puff one, and so on\nuntil the exhalation is complete. A few trials should convince you\nthat this simple exercise is of great value.\n\n\nHALF-BREATH\n\nIn both singing and speaking, the sustained delivery of long phrases\nor sentences sometimes makes unusual demands on the breath supply. It\nis a law of good singing that every phrase should end with the breath\nunexhausted. When the flow of text and music forbid the taking of a\nfull breath, half-breaths must be quietly taken at convenient points.\nInstead of letting the whole reservoir of motive power exhaust itself\nand then completely refill it, we should, by taking these\nhalf-breaths, maintain a reserve. A notable advocate of the use of the\nhalf-breath in singing is that past mistress of sustained and smooth\ndelivery, Marcella Sembrich.\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nREGISTERS\n\n\nThe subject of registers has always been the _b\u00eate noire_ of\nvocalists, a source of controversy and confusion. The term \"register,\"\nas commonly used, means a series of tones of a characteristic clang or\nquality, produced by the same mechanism. The term \"break\" is generally\nused to indicate the point at which a new register with sudden change\nappears.\n\nThe advocates of registers lay stress either on the changes in\nlaryngeal action, or the changes in tone quality. Before the days of\nthe laryngoscope, registers were treated simply as different qualities\nof tone, characterizing a certain portion of the voice's compass.\n\nThose who encourage the cultivation of register consciousness claim to\ndo so for the sake of the differences in tone-color which they\nassociate with the different \"registers.\" The purpose of the following\nchapters is to show that the quality or color of a tone is altogether\na matter of resonance, and _not_ a question of laryngeal action.\n\nMoreover, the mechanism of the larynx is not voluntary in its action,\nbut automatic, and even if a singer knew how the vocal cords should\nact it would not help him in the least to govern their action. The\nfact is that the results of laryngoscopic study of the vocal cords\nhave been disappointing and contradictory and investigators have\nfailed to define what correct laryngeal action is. There are those who\neven deny that the vocal cords govern the pitch of the voice.\n\nIn her thoughtful _Philosophy of Singing_, Clara Kathleen Rogers,\nwhile upholding \"registers,\" says that considered physiologically \"the\ndifferent registers of the voice should be regarded by the singer as\nonly so many _modifications in the quality of tone_, which\nmodifications are inherent in the voice itself.\" She then adds\nsignificantly: \"These modifications are not brought about by conscious\nadjustments of the parts employed, as any interference with the parts\nwill produce that obstacle to quality we call a 'break.'\"\n\nOne of the greatest of modern singers, Mme. Lilli Lehmann, in her\ninteresting work, _How to Sing_, says: \"Do registers exist by nature?\nNo. It may be said that they are created through long years of\nspeaking in the vocal range that is easiest to the person, or in one\nadopted by imitation.\" She speaks of three ranges of the voice, or,\nrather, three sections of the vocal range, as chest, middle, and head,\nsaying, \"All three form registers _when exaggerated_.\" After speaking\nof the hopeless confusion that results from clinging to the\nappellations of chest, middle, and head _register_, confounding voice\nwith register, she concludes:\n\n\"As long as the word 'register' is kept in use the registers will not\ndisappear, and yet the register question must be swept away, to give\nplace to another class of ideas, sounder views on the part of\nteachers, and a truer conception on the part of singers and pupils.\"\n\nThe trend of recent thought on this subject is further shown in\nFfrangcon-Davies' important work, _The Singing of the Future_, where,\nhaving in mind \"the useless torture to which thousands of students\nhave been subjected,\" he characterizes \"breaks\" and \"registers\" as\n\"paraphernalia supplied by credulity to charlatanism\"; and adds: \"How\nmany a poor pupil has become a practical monomaniac on the subject of\n_that break in my voice between D and D sharp_!\"\n\nMy own studies convince me that there is but one register, or, rather,\nno such thing as register, save as it applies to the compass of the\nvoice; and that chest, middle, head, and all other registers are\ncreations of false education. Training based upon the theory of many\nregisters results in an artificial and unnatural division of the\nvoice.\n\n\nTHE VOICE AND INSTRUMENTS COMPARED\n\nThe organ of the voice has long been considered the analogue of every\nother instrument except in regard to registers. Investigation\nindicates that it is analogous in this respect also. Compare the voice\ninstrument with the pianoforte, violin, and organ and the similarity\nwill plainly appear. The artificial instruments undergo no change when\nmaking a tone of higher or lower pitch other than the attuning of the\nvibrator to the pitch desired. All other parts remain the same. So\nwhen the voice is correctly focused and delivered, the only change\nincident to altered pitch is that made in the vibrator so as to give\nthe proper number of vibrations for the pitch required. If the scale\nis sung down, using the same vowel sound for the whole scale, the\ncomparison will be appreciated; the pupil will not be conscious of any\nchange in the vocal organ or experience any difficulty in descending\nthe scale. Faithful advocates of the theory of many registers say:\n\"Whenever in doubt about the production of a tone, sing _down_ to it\nfrom some tone above it, never _upward_ from a tone below,\" for they\nfind that singing down \"blends the registers.\" This we believe is\nbecause in singing down muscular and nerve tension is gradually\nrelaxed and consequently there is no \"register\" change in the voice.\n\nA study of the church organ will, I think, make this matter clear. The\norgan has many so-called registers, as the _vox humana_, _flute_,\n_oboe_, etc. These differ in the character of tone produced, because\nof the size and shape of the different sets of pipes and the material,\nwood or metal, of which they are made. But each similarly constructed\nset of pipes forms only one register, and the pitch of the set varies\nfrom low to high without any abrupt change in quality. All the tones\nare produced by the same methods and means, the bellows, the vibrator,\nand the pipe. In length and diameter, the pipe is proper to the tone\nproduced: a short pipe of small diameter for the high tones, and a\nlong, wide pipe for the bass tones.\n\nThe short vibrations of the high tones are perceived by the ear as\naffecting the air only, while the tones of the lowest bass pipes\nshake the solid foundations as well as the superstructure. So with the\nhuman voice. The coarser tissues cannot answer to the short vibrations\nof the upper tones, because they cannot move so quickly, while they\ncan, and do, respond to the vibrations of the low tones. This may\ncause some difference in degree, but not in kind. With all tones\nfocused alike, the low tones of the human organ may be regarded as\nhead tones plus the vibrations of the coarser tissues.\n\nIt has been said of registers that they are \"acoustic illusions which\ndisappear in the perfectly trained voice.\" As soon as the singer has\nlearned to use his voice normally all these defective changes\ndisappear.\n\n\nTWO CASES\n\nThe following incident illustrates the fact that registers are an\nartificial creation: A young lady who had been a patient of the author\nsince her childhood studied elocution in a metropolitan city, and to\nimprove her voice took vocal music lessons of a teacher of more than\nlocal repute. He found no end of trouble in teaching her to \"blend the\nregisters,\" and she had utterly failed to acquire the art. One summer\nshe came back for professional services and told her troubles. During\nthe few weeks of her stay she followed the author's suggestions, and\nwas fully convinced of their correctness and efficiency. Upon\nreturning to her lessons, she followed, without any explanations, the\nmethod that had been outlined for her. Her success in \"blending the\nregisters\" was a surprise to her teacher who heartily congratulated\nher upon what she had accomplished during the summer.\n\nAnother case is that of a young lady who was under the author's\ndirection as to vocal culture from childhood. As early as four years\nof age she was taught by the use of a few exercises to focus the voice\nin the nose and head, and to recognize the head vibrations by a light\ntouch of the finger. When about seven years old, she took ten lessons\nof a teacher on the same lines, and at fifteen years of age took\nanother brief course. In the meantime she had only the practice\nobtained by singing with the pupils in the schools she attended.\nLater, of her own volition, she sang more, and carefully applied the\nprinciples she had been taught, with the result that her voice\ncompassed nearly two octaves, evenly and smoothly, with no break or\nchange of focus or quality, or other intimation of \"register,\" and she\ndeveloped a speaking voice of more than ordinary quality and\nresonance.\n\nIt has also been my lot to aid in the development of the voices of\nmany patients after a surgical operation for cleft palate. Success has\nproven the correctness and efficacy of the principles set forth in\nthese pages.\n\nA majority of the more than fifty authors whose works I have examined\nhave laid great stress on the distinction between head and chest\ntones, open and closed tones, pure and impure tones, have warned\nagainst the nasal tone, and have constantly advocated a natural tone.\nThat there is no essential difference between a head tone and a chest\ntone has already been discussed and, it would seem, conclusively\nproven. Any tone, closed or open, is pure and musical if properly\nfocused and delivered, and the singer is at liberty to use either upon\nany note of the scale if it will serve better to express the sentiment\nhe wishes to convey to the hearer. The cooing of the love song, the\ncry of alarm for help, and the shout of the military charge require\nvery different qualities of voice to express the feelings, yet each\nmay be musical and will be so if properly delivered.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nRESONANCE IN GENERAL\n\n\nThe intimate relationship existing between voice culture and the\nscience of acoustics was formerly slightly perceived. The teaching of\nsinging, as an art, then rested altogether on an empirical basis, and\nthe acoustics of singing had not received the attention of scientists.\n\nWith the publication in 1863 of Helmholtz's great work[4] a new era\nbegan, although singer and scientist yet continue to look upon each\nother with suspicion. Teachers of the voice, casting about for a\nscientific basis for their work, were greatly impressed with\nHelmholtz's revelations in regard to vocal resonance--the fact that\ntones are modified in quality as well as increased in power by the\nresonance of the air in the cavities of pharynx and head.\n\n[Footnote 4: _Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen als physiologische\nGrundlage f\u00fcr die Theorie der Musik._ (The Sensations of Tone as a\nPhysiological Basis for the Theory of Music.)]\n\nWriting in 1886, Edmund J. Meyer speaks of the importance of a \"study\nof the influence of the different resonance cavities as the voice is\ncolored by one or the other, and the tuning each to each and each to\nall\"; yet, he adds, \"the subject is seldom heard of outside of books.\"\n\nThe basic importance of resonance in the use of the voice is still too\nlittle recognized, though obvious enough in the construction of\nmusical instruments. With the exception of a few instruments of\npercussion, all musical instruments possess three elements,--a\n_motor_, a _vibrator_, and a _resonator_. The violin has the moving\nbow for a motor, the strings for a vibrator, and the hollow body for a\nresonator. The French horn has the lungs of the performer for a motor,\nthe lips for a vibrator, and the gradually enlarging tube, terminating\nin the flaring bell, for a resonator. In the pianoforte the\nhammer-stroke, the strings, and the sounding-board perform the\ncorresponding offices. Though improvements in other parts of the piano\nhave done much to increase the volume of the tone, yet in the radical\nchange of form, size, and other physical qualities of the\nsounding-board consists the evolution of the modern pianoforte from\nthe primitive clavichord.\n\nIn all these instruments the quality and power of the tone depend upon\nthe presence of these three elements,--the perfection of their\nconstruction, their proper relation as to size and position, and the\nperfect adaptation of each part. A split sounding-board spoils the\npianoforte, the indented bell destroys the sweet tone of the French\nhorn, and a cracked fiddle is the synonym for pandemonium itself.\n\nThe quality and power of resonance is well illustrated by a\ntuning-fork, which, if set in vibration, can, unaided, scarcely be\nheard by the person holding it. But if rested on a table, or a plate\nof glass, or, better still, on the bridge of a violin, its tones may\nbe distinctly heard throughout a large hall.\n\nThe vibrating violin string when detached from the body of this\ninstrument, although attuned to pitch, gives absolutely no musical\nsound; the lips of the player placed on the mouthpiece detached from\nthe tube and bell of the brass instrument produce only a splutter; and\na pianoforte without a sounding-board is nil. The air column in the\ntube of the French horn, and the sounding-board of the pianoforte\ndevelop the vibrations caused by the lips and strings into musical\ntones pleasing to the ear. The tuning-fork alone can scarcely be\nheard, while the induced vibrations it sets up through properly\nadjusted resonance may be audible far away.\n\nThe vocal cords alone cannot make music any more than can the lips of\nthe cornet player apart from his instrument. _The tone produced by the\nvibrations alone of the two very small vocal bands must, in the nature\nof things, be very feeble._\n\nNinety-and-nine persons if asked the question, what produces tone in\nthe human-voice, would reply, \"the vibrations of the vocal cords,\"\nand stop there, as if that were all; whereas the answer is very\nincomplete--not even half an answer.\n\nA great deal of the irrational and injurious \"teaching\" of singing\nthat prevails everywhere, and of the controversy that befogs the\nsubject, is due to the widely prevalent notion that the little vocal\ncords are the principal cause of tone, whereas they are in themselves\ninsignificant as sound producers.\n\n=It is the vibrations of the air in the resonance chambers of the human\ninstrument, together with the induced vibrations of the instrument\nitself, which give tone its sonority, its reach, its color, and\nemotional power.=\n\nThat this is not an empirical statement but a scientific fact, a few\nsimple experiments will demonstrate.\n\nTone, in the musical sense, is the result of rapid periodic vibration.\nThe pitch of tone depends upon the _number_ of vibrations in a given\nperiod; the loudness of tone depends upon the _amplitude_ of the\nvibrations; the quality of tone depends upon the _form_ of the\nvibrations; and the form of the vibrations depends upon the\n_resonator_.\n\nThe fact that pure white light is a compound of all the tints of the\nrainbow into which it may be resolved by the prism is well known, but\nthe analogous fact that a pure musical tone is a compound of tones of\ndifferent rates of vibration, tones of different pitch, is not so much\na matter of common knowledge, and not so obvious.\n\nAnalysis shows that a musical tone consists of a fundamental note and\na series of overtones.[5] The ear is quite capable of recognizing many\nof these overtones and may be trained to do so. The most obvious can\nbe readily separated from a fundamental by a simple experiment.\n\n[Footnote 5: For fuller exposition see Tyndall on _Sound_, or the\nsection devoted to _Acoustics_ in any text-book on Physics.]\n\nThe overtones arrange themselves in a definite order, as follows: (1)\nthe fundamental or prime tone; (2) an overtone one octave above the\nfundamental; (3) an overtone a fifth above No. 2; (4) an overtone a\nfourth above No. 3 (two octaves above the fundamental); (5) an\novertone a major third above No. 4; (6) an overtone a minor third\nabove No. 5. There are others in still higher range but those\nindicated are easily demonstrated on the piano. For C they would be as\nfollows:\n\n\n[Music illustration]\n\nExperiment I\n\nStep to your piano, noiselessly press and hold down the key of No. 2,\nthen strike the fundamental No. 1, with force and immediately release\nit. As a result No. 2 will sound clearly, and if your ears are keen\nyou will at the same time hear No. 6. In succession hold down the keys\nof 3, 4, 5, and 6, while you strike and release the fundamental No. 1.\nIf your piano is \"in tune\" you will probably hear No. 6 when holding\nthe key of any other note of the series.\n\nIn a musical tone of rich quality the overtones just indicated are\npresent in their fulness, while tone that is weak and thin is made so\nby the absence or weakness of the overtones. I have stated that the\nquality of a tone depends on the _form_ of its vibrations, and that\nthe form of its vibrations is determined by the character of the\n_resonator_. We can now amplify this by saying that while the relative\npresence or absence of overtones determines the clang or color of a\ntone, their presence or absence is determined by the _character of the\nresonance_.\n\nAn English writer records that he was once in the garden at the back\nof a house while a gentleman was singing in the drawing-room. The\ntone-quality was good, and the pitch so unusually high he hastened to\nlearn who sang tenor high C so beautifully. On entering the room,\ninstead of the tenor he had supposed, he found the singer was a\nbaritone, and the note sung was only middle C. The fundamental tone\nhad not reached him in the garden but the first overtone, an octave\nabove it, had. Concrete illustrations will make the subject still\nclearer.\n\n\nExperiment II\n\nIf an ordinary tuning-fork when vibrating is held in the hand its\nintrinsic tone is too weak to carry far. Rest the handle of the\nvibrating fork on a bare table or the panel of the door, and the sound\nis greatly augmented. _The vibrations of the fork have by contact\ninduced similar vibrations in the wooden table or panel which\nreinforce the primary tone._\n\n\nExperiment III\n\nPlace the handle of the vibrating tuning-fork on a small upturned\nempty box, or, better still, in contact with the body of a violin, and\nthe sound will be stronger than in the previous experiment, because to\nthe vibrations of the wood are added the vibrations of the air\nenclosed in the box or the violin. _To the resonance of the wood has\nbeen added the sympathetic resonance of the confined air._\n\n\nExperiment IV\n\nHold the vibrating fork over the mouth of an empty fruit-jar and there\nwill probably be little or no reinforcement; but gently pour in water,\nthereby shortening the air column within the jar, and the sound of the\nfork will be gradually intensified until at a certain point it becomes\nquite loud. If you pour in still more water the sound will gradually\nbecome feebler."}
{"ID": 1004, "text": "\nIt chanced that the boys were standing near some of those who had issued\nforth from the hotel. Among them was the proprietor, plainly excited as\nhe saw his property going up in smoke and flames, and still getting some\nconsolation from the fact that he had a good insurance on it all.\n\nJust then a man came limping and seized hold of the hotel proprietor.\n\n\"Have you seen my brother, the professor?\" he demanded, in a trembling\nvoice.\n\n\"Oh! that you, Mr. Smythe? Your brother--no, I don't remember seeing him.\nBut I guess everybody got out all right. He must be around somewhere,\"\nreplied the other.\n\n\"I've asked a dozen people, and nobody has seen him. I tell you, man,\nhe's asleep up in that room yet, and will be burned to death!\" exclaimed\nthe gentleman, whom Jerry knew quite well. He was very lame and walked\nwith difficulty.\n\nHis brother, a balloonist of national reputation, had been visiting him\nrecently, and on account of some sickness at the house, had taken a room\nat the hotel.\n\n\"But no sane man could sleep through all this beastly row; and sure we\nhaven't seen any one at the windows, have we, boys?\" went on the fat\nhotel man.\n\n\"But you don't understand. I tell you he has been unable to sleep for\nseveral nights, and just before he left me early to-night he took a\nsleeping powder that he said would make him dead to the world for eight\nhours! He's up in his room yet, and will be lost unless some one goes\nand drags him out!\" cried Mr. Smythe.\n\n\"Which is his room, Mr. Ten Eyck?\" demanded an eager voice.\n\nThe stout hotel man looked at the speaker, who was none other than Jerry.\n\n\"You see that window over there at the end of the house, third\nfloor--that's his room! But the stairs must be ablaze by now, boy! It\nwould be suicide to think of trying to go up there!\" he cried.\n\n\"Come on, Frank; we'll take a look in, anyhow!\" shouted Jerry as he\ndashed off, followed by his chum, equally excited.\n\nStill, Frank was ordinarily a cool-headed fellow, and accustomed to\nweighing chances somewhat before imperiling his life. In this case, of\ncourse, he knew that more or less risk must be taken if they hoped to\nsave the sleeping balloonist.\n\nOne look they took in at the front door. The whole place was ablaze.\n\n\"Get out of the way, boys; we're going to put the hose in there!\" cried\none of the wearers of the fire-hats and coats, as he advanced.\n\n\"No chance there!\" exclaimed Frank, in despair, as he moved back.\n\nJerry clutched his arm.\n\n\"Come along with me. Perhaps the back stairs may not be burning, yet.\nThey happen to be further along toward the safe side. There's a chance!\"\nhe panted.\n\nHalf a minute later they had turned the corner, and were close to the\nrear exit.\n\n\"See, the smoke is coming out, but no fire. Shall we risk it?\" asked the\neager Jerry.\n\nFrank swept a quick look above and around. He was weighing the thing in\nhis mind, so that they might not be carried by impulse to their doom.\n\n\"It's worth while. At the worst we can jump into that tree from the\nwindow. And it's just terrible to think of the professor sleeping on\nuntil he is caught. Lead the way, Jerry; you know about it better than\nI do. Remember, on the third floor, and turn to the left!\"\n\nThey darted in. Several persons near by shouted warnings, but the\nwords fell on deaf ears, for already the daring lads were rushing up the\nnarrow stairs. Around them the smoke was dense. It smarted their eyes\ndreadfully, so that they were compelled to rub them from time to time in\norder to see at all.\n\nReaching the first landing, Jerry turned to the left. Frank had hold of\nhis chum's coat, for he did not want to get lost in that smoky interior,\nand Jerry was the one acquainted with the situation.\n\nNow they had reached the second flight of stairs. A burst of red fire\nfurther along the hall served to show them for a brief space of time how\nmatters stood. Up the stairs they stumbled, gaining the upper landing.\nAgain Jerry turned to the left.\n\n\"He said the last room, didn't he?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Yes, go on!\" answered Frank, still gripping his comrade's garment.\n\n\"Then here's the door!\"\n\n\"Shut?\"\n\n\"Yes, and locked, too! What shall we do?\" exclaimed Jerry.\n\n\"Kick it in--any old way, but we must be quick!\" answered the other.\n\nThen the two threw themselves upon the door. It quickly gave way before\ntheir combined assault. They pushed into the room. The smoke had gained a\nfooting here, but on account of the closed door it was not nearly so\nbad as in the halls.\n\nImmediately they saw a figure stretched across the bed. The balloonist\nhad evidently been overcome by sleep before he thought to undress, and\ndropped over just as he had come from his lame brother's house.\n\n\"Wake up, professor, the house is on fire!\" shouted Frank in the ear of\nthe man.\n\nJerry, meanwhile, was shaking him vigorously; but all their efforts\nseemed to be of no avail. The man slept on as peacefully as though a\nbabe, such was the power of the drug he had taken.\n\n\"We can't stay here long,\" said Frank, as the smoke thickened in the\nroom. \"And as he won't wake up, why, we'll have to try and carry or drag\nhim down.\"\n\nFortunately, the man was not a very large person, or they might have\ndespaired of ever accomplishing such a thing.\n\n\"Take hold on that side, Jerry. Now, lift, and drag his heels. That's the\nonly way we can do,\" exclaimed Frank, who feared that even short as their\nstay in that room had been they would find conditions changed for the\nworse when they again reached the hall.\n\nThe professor paid not the least attention to what they were doing. He\nhad possibly taken an overdose of his sleeping-powder, and only for the\ncoming of the two chums must have perished miserably, like a rat in a\ntrap.\n\nWhen Frank threw open the door of the room again he uttered a cry of\nalarm. The back stairway was a mass of flame. Although hardly more than\ntwo minutes had passed since they came up those stairs, it was now\nmanifestly impossible to pass down again.\n\nHe slammed the door shut and found Jerry staring at him in the half\nlight.\n\n\"Talk to me about your fiery furnaces, that beats them all!\" exclaimed\nFrank's chum, as he let go the professor's shoulders. \"What shall we do\nnow?\"\n\nFrank ran over to the window and threw up the sash. He looked out and\nthen came back to where Jerry stood, trembling with excitement. Frank was\nas cool as ever in his life.\n\n\"There's a chance, Jerry,\" he shouted. \"No fire below! Take hold here;\ntear up these sheets and knot them into a rope. Work for your life, and\nif the fire only holds back we may be able to save both the professor and\nourselves! But work! work!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHEADED SOUTH\n\n\nThey did work with a vim, for the smoke was getting more oppressive with\neach passing second; and from the glimpse they had taken of the stairway\nit was plain to the boys that presently the fire would wrap the whole\nsouth end of the building in its grip, when their case would indeed be\ndesperate.\n\nEach tore and knotted until as if by magic a long rope was fashioned.\nTrue, it might betray them at the last and break, but Frank believed\nthe sheets to be of good material and nearly new.\n\nHe had not time to even test the frail rope, but fastened it around the\nsleeping balloonist, under his arms.\n\n\"Now help me lift him over the window-sill,\" he cried.\n\nThey had little difficulty in doing that, for the professor was a small,\nslight man. Once he was passed over the ledge, they began to lower away.\n\nFrank only hoped in his heart that the fire might restrain its fury for a\nbrief space of time. If it darted out below it must catch the human\nburden which they were lowering so speedily.\n\nShouts were heard outside. It seemed as though fully an hundred voices\nwere raised to applaud the daring feat of the two boys, as the figure of\nthe professor was seen coming rapidly down at the end of the rope made of\ntorn sheets.\n\n\"If it's only long enough!\" gasped Jerry.\n\n\"Hurrah! they've got hold of him! He's saved!\" roared Frank, as the\ntremendous pull suddenly ceased.\n\nThey had about reached the end of the rope, so that this happy event\ncame just in the nick of time. Frank hurriedly fastened that end to the\nbed-post.\n\n\"Climb out, Jerry, and slide down. Not a word now, or we may lose our\nchance!\"\n\nJerry had been about to object, wishing his chum to go first. He realized\nthe truth of what Frank said, however, and how foolish it would be to\nstand back on a matter so small. Accordingly he clambered over the\nwindow-sill and vanished from view.\n\nFrank got in position to follow, and only waited until he had reason to\nbelieve his chum had reached safety. The rope had done bravely, but it\ncertainly could never stand the strain of two of them at the same time.\n\nAnd even as he waited there was a flash of fire below, as the flames ate\nthrough the sheathing of the house. A tremendous yell went up.\n\n\"Come down, Frank--oh! quick!\" he caught above the clamor, and he knew\nthat it was Will's shrill voice he heard.\n\nThe fire was perilously close to the rope. In a second it might catch\nand be severed. Frank did not hesitate. He was accustomed to meeting\nemergencies promptly, and doing the right thing.\n\nDown he slipped, passing the threatening flame, in fact shooting through\nit just as the rope began to be consumed in its hot breath. Frank had\nalmost reached the point of safety when he felt his support collapse, and\nhe dropped downward.\n\nSomething caught him, something that seemed endowed with life--the\nextended arms of his three chums eagerly fashioned into a net, and he was\nnot injured, beyond a little singeing of his hair as he passed through\nthe fiery torch.\n\nThe boys were glad to get away from the crowd of enthusiastic admirers\nwho wanted to lift Frank and Jerry on their shoulders, and carry them\naround town in triumph, something that felt repulsive to the lads.\n\nBut the lame brother of the man they had saved, seized upon them ere they\nwent off.\n\n\"A thousand thanks to you, for your brave deed!\" he cried. \"You have\nsaved a human life to-night, boys, and one of more than ordinary value.\nMy brother is employed by the Government to experiment with balloons and\naeroplanes, and his discoveries may prove a great thing for our nation in\ncase of a foreign war. To-morrow he will thank you himself, and from\nhis heart. Your mothers have cause to be proud of their sons, and I shall\ntell them so myself.\"\n\nFrom a distance the boys watched the hotel burn, and talked over the\naffair just as though they might have been casual watchers, and had no\nparticular interest in the matter. And yet two of them had come very\nclose to sacrificing their young lives in attempting to save that of\nanother.\n\nBoth Bluff and Will had suffered tortures while their chums were\ninside the doomed structure. Their voices had led all the rest as the\nsheet-rope fell from the upper window, with the form of the professor\ndangling at the end, for they knew the daring plan of their mates had\nbeen a brilliant success.\n\nThe fire did not jump to any of the nearby dwellings or stores, thanks to\nthe efficient labors of the department, the members of which worked like\nTrojans in order to confine it to its original field.\n\nWhen it had died down the boys separated once more, and the hearty grip\nthat passed between them was evidence of the sincere affection that bound\nthis quartette of clean, manly fellows in common.\n\nNeither Frank nor Jerry said a word to their parents about the heroic\npart they had played in the rescue of Professor Smythe. Imagine the\nastonishment of Frank's father when that gentleman, in company with his\nbrother, a respected business man of Centerville, called at the house,\nthe next morning after breakfast, and related the whole circumstance.\n\nAnd when Frank and Jerry were called down from the den, where, in company\nwith the others, they were doing some packing, they blushed under the\nhearty words of praise heaped upon them by the two gentlemen.\n\n\"Why, I'm going South myself, boys,\" declared the balloonist, when he\nheard of their contemplated trip, \"and wouldn't it be a queer thing now\nif we happened to come across one another down in Dixieland? I'm heading\nfor Atlanta, to steer my big balloon to the eastward at the first\nfavorable chance, in order to settle some questions about air currents\nthat have long been baffling us all. Depend on it, if I could do you any\nsort of a favor I'd go far out of my way to try and even up the debt I\nowe you.\"\n\nLittle did any of them suspect under what strange conditions their next\nmeeting would really be.\n\nAll Centerville was ringing with the story of the brave exploit of Frank\nand Jerry. When the latter reached home that noon he was overwhelmed\nwith hysterical words of praise from his mother; while his father had\ncome home from his office, beset by a dozen acquaintances desirous of\ncongratulating him on having a son of such heroic mould.\n\nJerry was very uneasy under all this favorable comment. He did not like\nto be looked upon as differing in any degree from other boys.\n\n\"Any fellow would have done the same thing. We were lucky enough to have\nthe chance, that's all,\" he insisted, as his mother kissed him again and\nagain, crying a little at the same time at the thought of what might have\nhappened; while his father gripped his hand and patted him on the back\naffectionately.\n\nBy afternoon the boys decided that they had everything packed they could\nthink of, and after that they began to try and possess their souls in\npatience.\n\n\"No sleep for me to-night, fellows,\" declared Jerry, as he prepared to go\nhome, as supper-time came around.\n\n\"I'd advise you to try and get a few winks if you can. To-morrow night\nwe'll be on the train, and not much chance then. It's a lucky thing\nthat all of us know something about machinery. Our experience with our\nmotor-cycles will come in good play now. And here's Jerry been studying\nup on the running of an automobile with that retired chauffeur, Garrison,\nwho's teaching Andy Lasher how to run a car.\"\n\n\"Yes, but, Frank, how about you taking lessons about the engine of a\nmotor-boat? I know you've got several books on the subject since your\nfather half promised to put a little craft on Lake Camalot next season,\"\nremarked Jerry.\n\n\"Well,\" laughed Frank, fairly caught, \"between the lot of us it'll be\nstrange if we don't know how to handle that dandy boat of Cousin\nArchie's--the _Jessamine_ he calls her.\"\n\n\"Three cheers for the _Jessamine,_ then!\" said Bluff.\n\nThey were given with a will, after which the boys separated. Since this\nwould be their last night at home for two weeks they had sensibly\ndecided to spend it in the bosom of their families. Everything was done,\nat any rate, so that it was useless to bother about that matter any more.\n\nIn spite of Frank's warning it is very unlikely that any one of the four\nslept very soundly. The near future beckoned to them with such grand\npossibilities concerning the sport they loved, that they could not get it\nout of their minds; and innumerable plans for the happy times ahead kept\ntheir brains busy the major portion of that last night under the parental\nroof-trees.\n\nFinally the morning dawned, with a light snow falling. There was a bustle\nin at least four homes that day, and presently the intending travelers\ngathered at the station long before the train was due that would take\nthem on to Philadelphia, and then, with a change of cars, to the\nbeckoning sunny Southland.\n\nAnd when finally the parting moment came, there were hurried good-byes,\nthe bags were thrown into the baggage car, and as the train pulled out\nthose of their school friends who had come down to see them off, as well\nas their relatives, waved a shower of handkerchiefs amid a chorus of\nshouts.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Bluff, as he settled down in his seat, \"we're on the way\nto the greatest time of our lives!\"'\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nJERRY MEETS TROUBLE HALF WAY\n\n\n\"Ain't she a beauty, though?\"\n\n\"Finest thing ever put in the water! And to think we're going to live\naboard her for nearly two weeks! It's the greatest luck ever!\" observed\nWill.\n\n\"Talk to me about your automobiles and aeroplanes, give me a neat little\nmotor-boat for mine. I wouldn't change places with King George just now.\"\n\nFrank said nothing, but the smile on his face was a satisfied one.\nIndeed, it could not well be otherwise. Any boy who loved camping and\ncruising as much as he did must have been thrilled at the prospect of\nrunning that jaunty little craft for a spell, navigating new waterways\nand making discoveries constantly, such as are calculated to please the\nhearts of hunters and water-dogs in general.\n\nThe motor-boat was one of the most modern make. It had an automobile hood\nfor the front, and this could be so extended that the entire boat was\nshielded. On the other hand, on sunny days it could be pushed back,\nallowing of perfect freedom.\n\nThe journey south had been effected without any accident. They were now\nstopping at a little hotel in this town on the river where the railroad\ncrossed. It was a section of Northern Florida. The great and mysterious\nGulf of Mexico, they knew, lay not a far stretch away toward the south.\nIndeed, Jerry had declared he could already smell salt water, though his\nchums laughed at him, and declared that it was more likely the odor of\nthe mud along the bank of the narrow but deep stream down which they\nexpected to cruise shortly.\n\n\"All the same, I'll be mighty glad to set eyes on that same gulf,\" said\nJerry; \"I've always wanted to see it, ever since I read about the\ndoings of those old filibusters who used to lie in wait and seize the\ntreasure ships going home from the Spanish Main.\"\n\n\"Listen to him, will you?\" broke out Bluff, laughing. \"Honest, now, I\nbelieve he expects to run across a few of those old fossil pirates,\nBlackbeard, Captain Kidd and their kind.\"\n\n\"Well, hardly, but it may be we'll meet up with a few up-to-date pirates\nbefore we get through--chaps who can charge ten prices for something you\njust feel you must have. The times are out of joint, boys. Things have\nchanged a little, that's all, but the world is just as full of human\nsharks as ever,\" argued Jerry.\n\n\"I guess Jerry's right, fellows, and when that gaunt landlord of the inn\npresents his little bill perhaps you'll say that the buccaneer came\nsooner than you expected. Besides, who can say what lies before us? There\nare many swamps to be passed through, I'm told, and they say that more\nthan one fugitive black, wanted for some crime, lives out in those\nplaces. We must keep our eyes open all the time.\"\n\n\"And depend on it, Frank knows. He's been picking up information right\nand left ever since we got here,\" remarked Will, who was, of course,\ncarrying his beloved camera, with which he had taken many splendid\npictures of the past exploits of the four chums.\n\n\"When do we get under way?\" asked Bluff, eagerly, as he examined the\nprovisions made for cooking, with a battery of little lamps fashioned\nto burn kerosene in the shape of gas--Bluff was always interested in all\nthat pertained to the cooking parts of an expedition.\n\n\"Everything is ready now,\" remarked Frank. \"We'll go back to the inn, all\nbut Will, settle our score, and fetch what few things are left. I've got\na rough chart of the river, you know, boys, on which we'll have to depend\nuntil we get to the gulf.\"\n\n\"And then?\" asked Will.\n\n\"Oh, the Government charts will carry us, then, the rest of the way. They\nhave everything down, up to several miles off shore, and all the bayous\nand cuts besides. Come on, Jerry and Bluff; get busy.\"\n\nLeft in charge of the boat for half an hour, Will sat there in the warm\nsunshine, trying to picture what it looked like up around cold, bleak\nCenterville just then. As he fondled his camera other memories were\ncalled up, in which it had done its share in the way of perpetuating the\nexciting events connected with the various outings enjoyed by the four\nchums.\n\nWhile Will sits thus and lets his mind wander back to other scenes it may\nbe just as well for us to take a quick survey of these same events, so as\nto understand something of the ties that held these four boys together.\n\nThey formed the Rod, Gun and Camera Club, and their first outing had been\nat the time a storm took part of the Academy roof off, allowing a short\nFall vacation on the part of the scholars. At that time they had gone\ninto the woods, and there encountered a variety of stirring adventures,\nas set forth in the initial volume of this series called: \"The Outdoor\nChums; or, The First Tour of the Rod, Gun and Camera Club.\"\n\nAt Thanksgiving time they planned for another little camping trip, over\non Wildcat Island, which had quite a bad name on account of the ferocious\nanimals known to exist in its dense thickets, and also because a wild man\nwas said to have been seen there many times. What the four chums saw and\ndid there, and the multitude of remarkable things that came to pass\nwhile they were off on this trip, from the robbery on the steamboat to\nthe discovery about the wild man, are told in the second book of the\nseries, entitled: \"The Outdoor Chums on the Lake; or, Lively Adventures\non Wildcat Island,\"\n\nIn due time came the summer vacation, and as they had a couple of weeks\nto be together before going away to seashore or mountains with their\nparents, the boys arranged to spend this time in the Sunset Mountains,\nthat lay ten miles back of Newtonport, which place was on the west shore\nof the lake, opposite Centerville. The rumor of a ghost that was said to\nhaunt Oak Ridge did much to draw the boys, and it can be readily\nunderstood that before they left their camp in the hills they had\nsucceeded in discovering the astonishing truth about that same spectre.\nJust how this was done, together with many other thrilling episodes, you\nwill find in the record of the outing as given in the third volume,\ncalled: \"The Outdoor Chums in the Forest; or, Laying the Ghost of Oak\nRidge.\"\n\nBy the time Will had run the gamut of these adventures, some of which\ncaused him to shiver, while others brought a smile on his face, he heard\nthe voices of his chums drawing near.\n\nThey soon joined him, each burdened with some more of the outfit in the\nway of blankets, and clothes-bags made of waterproof canvas.\n\nThese were hastily stowed away, after which the boys began to get busy.\nFrank had, ere now, closely examined the engine of the launch, and\neven started it going so as to get \"the hang of the thing,\" as he said.\nHe felt that he had nothing to fear with regard to his ability to\nhandle it.\n\n\"If anything does happen we will have to use the push-poles, and in that\nway float down on the swift current until we get to a town,\" he said,\nlaughingly; but not one of them had the slightest fear.\n\n\"All aboard for the gulf!\" called Will, as he stood by the rail watching\nJerry unwarp the hawser that held the nose of the boat down-stream,\nanother securing the stern above.\n\nJust as soon as this latter was unfastened the boat would begin to move\nwith the rapid current, and at that time Frank wanted his engine to be\nworking.\n\n\"Ready, Frank?\" called Jerry from astern.\n\nHe could cast off there, recovering the rope as they moved along.\n\nThe engine began to whirr.\n\n\"Say, doesn't that sound encouraging?\" ventured Bluff, as the cheery\ncough smote the air, and announced the whole power of twelve horses to be\nat their disposal.\n\n\"I only hope she turns out one-half as good as she looks,\" remarked\nFrank, who believed that the proof of the pudding lay in the eating of\nit.\n\nA minute later, satisfied that everything was working, he shouted:\n\n\"Let her go, Jerry!\"\n\nImmediately the motor-boat commenced to glide down-stream. Frank found\nthat his engine worked like a charm. He could apparently do anything he\nwanted with it, and the whole apparatus seemed more like a plaything than\na powerful motor.\n\n\"A good beginning. Hope it keeps up,\" remarked Bluff.\n\n\"Me for a life on the ocean wave,\" sang Jerry as he coiled the rope\nship-shape, and then going forward climbed up on the bow to look out\nfor \"snags.\""}
{"ID": 415, "text": "Only the name is wanting in this commission, and you must\nfill that up.\"\n\nD'Artagnan took the document with hesitation. He looked at it, saw it\nwas a lieutenant's commission in the musketeers, and fell at the\ncardinal's feet.\n\n\"Monseigneur, my life is yours. Dispose of it as you will. But I do not\ndeserve this. I have three friends, all more worthy----\""}
{"ID": 273, "text": " A still stronger\nattraction were the boys with the humming \"baboons,\" the rattles and\nflags, for from them purchases had always to be made, with jokes thrown\ninto the bargain--bad ones, which are invariably the most amusing; and\nwhat a pleasure it was to twirl the \"baboon\" with one's own little hand,\nand, if the hand got cold during the process, one did not feel it, for it\nseemed like midsummer with a swarm of flies buzzing about one!\n\nBut most enjoyable of all was probably the throng of people, great and\nsmall, and all there was to hear and see among them and to answer.  It\nseemed as if the Christmas joy of the city was concentrated there, and\nfilled the not over-clear atmosphere like the pungent odour of Christmas\ntrees.\n\nPut there were other things to experience as well as mere gaiety--the\npale child in the corner, with its little bare feet, holding in its cold,\nred hands the six little sheep of snow-white wool on a tiny green board;\nand that other yonder, with the little man made of prunes spitted on tiny\nsticks.\n\nHow small and pale the child is!  And how eloquently the blue eyes invite\na purchaser, for it is only with looks that the wares are extolled!  I\nstill see them both before me!  The threepenny pieces they get are to\nhelp their starving mother to heat the attic room in those winter days\nwhich, cold though they are, may warm the heart.  Looking at them our\nmother told us how hunger hurts, and how painful want and misery are to\nbear, and we never left the Christmas fair without buying a few sheep or\na prune man, though all we could do with them was to give them away\nagain.  When I wrote my fairy-tale, The Nuts, I had the Christmas fair at\nBerlin in my mind's eye, and I seemed to see the wretched little girl\nwho, among all the happy folk, had found nothing but cold, pain, anguish,\nand a handful of nuts, and who afterward fared so happily--not, indeed,\namong men, but with the most beautiful angels in heaven.\n\nWhy are the Berlin children defrauded of this bright and innocent\npleasure, and their hearts denied the practice of exercising charity?\n\nTurning my thoughts backward, it seems to me as if almost too much beauty\nand pleasure were crowded together at Christmas, richly provided with\npresents as we were besides, for over and above the Christmas fair there\nwas Kroll's Christmas exhibition, where clever heads and skilful hands\ntransformed a series of great halls, at one time into the domain of\nwinter, at another into the kingdom of the fairies.  There was nothing to\ndo but look.\n\nImagination came to a standstill, for what could it add to these wonders?\nYet the fairyland of which Ludo and I had dreamed was more beautiful and\nmore real than this palpable magnificence of tin and pasteboard; which\nis, perhaps, one reason why the overexcited imagination of a city child\nshrinks back and tries to find in reality what a boy brought up in the\nquiet of the country can conjure up before his mind himself.\n\nThen, too, there were delightful sights in the Gropius panorama and\nFuchs's confectioner's shop--in the one place entertaining things, in the\nother instructive.  At the panorama half the world was spread out before\nus in splendid pictures, so presented and exhibited as to give the most\nvivid impression of reality.\n\nFrom the letters of our mother's brothers, who were Dutch officials in\nJava and Japan, as well as from books of travel which had been read to\nus, we had already heard much of the wonders of the Orient; and at the\nGropius panorama the inner call that I had often seemed to hear--\"Away!\nto the East\"--only grew the stronger.  It has never been wholly silent\nsince, but at that time I formed the resolution to sail around the world,\nor--probably from reading some book--to be a noble pirate.  Nor should I\nhave been dissatisfied with the fate of Robinson Crusoe.  The Christmas\nexhibition at Fuchs's, Unter den Linden, was merely entertaining--Berlin\njokes in pictures mainly of a political or satirical order.  Most\ndistinctly of all I remember the sentimental lady of rank who orders her\nservant to catch a fly on a tea-tray and put it carefully out of the\nwindow.  The obedient Thomas gets hold of the insect, takes it to the\nwindow, and with the remark, \"Your ladyship, it is pouring, the poor\nthing might take cold,\" brings it back again to the tea-tray.\n\nThere was plenty of such entertainment in winter, and we had our part in\nmuch of it.  Rellstab, the well-known editor of Voss's journal, made a\nclever collection of such jokes in his Christmas Wanderings.  We could\nread, and whatever was offered by that literary St. Nicholas and highly\nrespected musical critic for cultivated Berlin our mother was quite\nwilling we should enjoy.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD\n\nBEFORE THE REVOLUTION\n\nOn the 18th of March, the day of the fighting in the streets of Berlin,\nwe had been living for a year in the large suite of apartments at No. 7\nLinkstrasse.\n\nOf those who inhabited the same house with us I remember only the\nsculptor Streichenberg, whose studio was next to our pretty garden, and\nthe Beyers, a married couple.  He, later a general and commander of the\ntroops besieging Strasburg in 1870, was at that time a first lieutenant.\nShe was a refined, extremely amiable, and very musical woman, who had met\nour mother before, and now entered into the friendliest relations with\nher.\n\nA guest of their quiet household, a little Danish girl, one of Fran\nBeyer's relatives, shared our play in the garden, and worked with us at\nthe flower beds which had been placed in our charge.  I remember how\nperfectly charming I thought her, and that her name was Detta Lvsenor.\n\nAll the details of our intercourse with her and other new acquaintances\nwho played with us in the garden have vanished from my memory, for the\noccurrences of that time are thrown into shadow by the public events and\npolitical excitement around us.  Even children could not remain untouched\nby what was impending, for all that we saw or heard referred to it and,\nin our household, views violently opposed to each other, with the\nexception of extreme republicanism, were freely discussed.\n\nThe majority of our conservative acquaintances were loud in complaint,\nand bewailed the king's weakness, and the religious corruption and\nhypocritical aspirations which were aroused by the honest, but romantic\nand fanatical religious zeal of Frederick William IV.\n\nI must have heard the loudest lamentations concerning this cancer of\nsociety at this time, for they are the most deeply imprinted in my\nmemory.  Even such men as the Gepperts, Franz Kugler, H. M. Romberg,\nDrake, Wilcke, and others, with whose moderate political views I became\nacquainted later, used to join us.  Loyal they all were, and our mother\nwas so strongly attached to the house of Hohenzollern that I heard her\nrequest one of the younger men, when he sharply declared it was time to\nforce the king to abdicate, either to moderate his speech or cease to\nvisit her house.\n\nOur mother could not prevent, however, similar and worse speeches from\ncoming to our ears.\n\nA particularly deep impression was made upon us by a tall man with a big\nblond beard, whose name I have forgotten, but whom we generally met at\nthe sculptor Streichenberg's when he took us with him in our play hours\ninto his great workshop.  This man appeared to be in very good\ncircumstances, for he always wore patent-leather boots, and a large\ndiamond ring on his finger; but with his vivacious, even passionate\ntemperament, he trampled in the dust the things I had always revered.\nI hung on his lips when he talked of the rights of the people, and of his\nown vocation to break the way for freedom, or when he anathematized those\nwho oppressed a noble nation with the odious yoke of slavery.\n\nCatch phrases, like \"hanging the last king with the guts of the last\npriest,\" I heard for the first time from him, and although such speeches\ndid not please me, they made an impression because they awakened so much\nsurprise, and more than once he called upon us to be true sons of our\ntime and not a tyrant's bondmen.  We heard similar remarks elsewhere in a\nmore moderate form, and from our companions at school in boyish language.\n\nThere were two parties there also, but besides loyalty another sentiment\nflourished which would now be called chauvinism, yet which possessed a\nnoble influence, since it fostered in our hearts that most beautiful\nflower of the young mind, enthusiasm for a great cause.\n\nAnd during the history lessons on Brandenburg-Prussia our cheeks would\nglow, for what German state could boast a grander, prouder history than\nPrussia under the Hohenzollerns, rising by ability, faithfulness to duty,\ncourage, and self-sacrificing love of country from small beginnings to\nthe highest power?\n\nThe Liebe school had been attended only by children of good families,\nwhile in the Schmidt school a Count Waldersee and Hoym, the son of a\ncapmaker and dealer in eatables, sat together on the same bench.  The\nmost diverse tendencies were represented, and all sorts of satirical\nsongs and lampoons found their way to us.  Such parodies as this in the\nSong of Prussia we could understand very well:\n\n              \"I am a Prussian, my colours you know,\n               From darkness to light they boldly go;\n               But that for Freedom my fathers died,\n               Is a fact which I have not yet descried.\"\n\nNor did more delicate allusions escape us; for who had not heard, for\ninstance, of the Friends of Light, who played a part among the Berlin\nliberals?  To whose ears had not come some longing cry for freedom, and\nespecially freedom of the press?\n\nAnd though that ever-recurring word Pressfreiheit (freedom of the press)\nwas altered by the wags for us boys into Fressfreiheit (liberty to stuff\nyourself); though, too, it was condemned in conservative circles as a\ndangerous demand, threatening the peace of the family and opening the\ndoor to unbridled license among writers for the papers, still we had\nheard the other side of the question; that the right freely to express\nan opinion belonged to every citizen, and that only through the power\nof free speech could the way be cleared for a better condition of things.\nIn short, there was no catchword of that stormy period which we ten and\ntwelve-year-old boys could not have interpreted at least superficially.\n\nTo me it seemed a fine thing to be able to say what one thought right,\nstill I could not understand why such great importance should be\nattributed to freedom of the press.  The father of our friend Bardua was\nentitled a counsellor of the Supreme Court, but then he had also filled\nthe office of a censor, and what a nice, bright boy his son was!\n\nAmong our comrades was also the son of Prof. Hengstenberg, who was the\nhead of the pietists and Protestant zealots, whom we had heard mentioned\nas the darkest of all obscurants, and his influence over the king\nexecrated.  By the central flight of steps at the little terrace in front\nof the royal palace stood the fine statues of the horse-tamers, and the\nsteps were called Hengstenberg (Hengste, horses, and Berg, mountain).\nAnd this name was explained by the circumstance that whoever would\napproach the king must do so by the way of \"Hengstenberg.\"\n\nWe knew that quip, too, and yet the son of this mischievous enemy of\nprogress was a particularly fine, bright boy, whom we all liked, and\nwhose father, when I saw him, astonished me, for he was a kindly man\nand could laugh as cheerfully as anybody.\n\nIt was all very difficult to understand; and, as we had more friends\namong the conservatives than among the democrats, we played usually with\nthe former, and troubled ourselves very little about the politics of our\nfriends' fathers.  There was, however, some looking askance at each\nother, and cries of \"Loyal Legioner!\" \"Pietist!\" \"Democrat!\" \"Friend of\nLight!\" were not wanting.\n\nAs often happens in the course of history, uncomprehended or only half-\ncomprehended catchwords serve as a banner around which a great following\ncollects.\n\nThe parties did not come to blows, probably for the sole reason that we\nconservatives were by far the stronger.  Yet there was a fermentation\namong us, and a day came when, young as I was, I felt that those who\ncalled the king weak and wished for a change were in the right.\n\nIn the spring of 1847 every one felt as if standing on a volcano.\n\nWhen, in 1844, it was reported that Burgomaster Tschech had fired at\nthe king--I was then seven years old--we children shared the horror and\nindignation of our mother, although in the face of such a serious event\nwe boys joined in the silly song which was then in everybody's mouth, and\nwhich began somewhat in this fashion:\n\n              \"Was there ever a man so insolent\n               As Tschech, the mayor, on mischief bent?\"\n\nWhat did we not hear at that time about all the hopes that had been\nplaced on the crown-prince, and how ill he had fulfilled them as king!\nHow often I listened quietly in some corner while my mother discussed\nsuch topics with gentlemen, and from the beginning of the year 1847 there\nwas hardly a conversation in Berlin which did not sooner or later touch\nupon politics and the general discontent or anxiety.  But I had no need\nto listen in order to hear such things.  On every walk we took they were\nforced upon our ears; the air was full of them, the very stones repeated\nthem.\n\nEven we boys had heard of Johann Jacoby's \"Four Questions,\" which\ndeclared a constitution a necessity.\n\nI have not forgotten the indignation called forth, even among our\nacquaintances of moderate views, by Hassenpflug's promotion; and if his\nname had never come to my ears at home, the comic papers, caricatures,\nand the talk everywhere would have acquainted me with the feelings\nawakened among the people of Berlin by the favour he enjoyed.  And added\nto this were a thousand little features, anecdotes, and events which all\npointed to the universal discontent.\n\nThe wars for freedom lay far behind us.  How much had been promised to\nthe people when the foreign foe was to be driven out, and how little\nhad been granted!  After the July revolution of 1830, many German states\nhad obtained a constitution, while in Prussia not only did everything\nremain in the same condition, but the shameful time of the spying by the\nagitators had begun, when so many young men who had deserved well of\ntheir country, like Ernst Moriz, Arndt, and Jahn, distinguished and\nhonourable scholars like Welcker, suffered severely under these odious\npersecutions.  One must have read the biography of the honest and\nlaborious Germanist Wackernagel to be able to credit the fact that that\nquiet searcher after knowledge was pursued far into middle life by the\nmost bitter persecution and rancorous injuries, because as a schoolboy--\nwhether in the third or fourth class I do not know--he had written a\nletter in which was set forth some new division, thought out in his\nchildish brain, for the united German Empire of which he dreamed.\n\nSuch men as Kamptz and Dambach kept their places by casting suspicion\nupon others and condemning them, but they little dreamed when they\nsummoned before their execrable tribunal the insignificant student Fritz\nReuter, of Mecklenburg, how he would brand their system and their names.\nMost of these youths who had been plunged into misery by such rascally\nabuse of office and the shameful way in which a king naturally anything\nbut malignant, was misled and deceived, were either dead and gone, or had\nbeen released from prison as mature men.  What hatred must have filled\ntheir souls for that form of government which had dared thus to punish\ntheir pure enthusiasm for a sacred cause--the unity and well-earned\nfreedom of their native land!  Ah, there were dangerous forces to subdue\namong those grey-haired martyrs, for it was their fiery spirit and high\nhearts which had brought them to ruin.\n\nThose who had been disappointed in the results of the war for liberty,\nand those who had suffered in the demagogue period, had ventured to hope\nonce more when the much-extolled crown-prince, Frederick William IV,\nmounted the throne.  What disappointment was in store for them; what new\nsuffering was laid upon them when, instead of the rosy dawn of freedom\nwhich they fancied they had seen, a deeper darkness and a more reckless\noppression set in!  What they had taken for larks announcing the breaking\nof a brighter day turned out to be bats and similar vermin of the night.\nIn the state the exercise of a boundless arbitrary power; in the Church,\ndark intolerance; and, in its train, slavish submission, favour-seeking,\nrolling up of the eyes, and hypocrisy as means to unworthy ends, and\nespecially to that of speedy promotion--the deepest corruption of all--\nthat of the soul.\n\nWhat naturally followed caused the loyalists the keenest pain, for the\ninjury done to the strong monarchical feeling of the Prussian people in\nthe person and the conduct of Frederick William IV was not to be\nestimated.  Only the simple heroic greatness and the paternal dignity\nof an Emperor William could have repaired it.\n\nIn the year preceding the revolution there had been a bad harvest, and\nfrightful stories were told of famine in the weaving districts of\nSilesia.  Even before Virchow, in his free-spoken work on the famine-\ntyphus, had faithfully described the full misery of those wretched\nsufferers, it had become apparent to the rulers in Berlin that something\nmust be done to relieve the public distress.\n\nThe king now began to realize distinctly the universal discontent, and\nin order to meet it and still further demands he summoned the General\nAssembly.\n\nI remember distinctly how fine our mother thought the speech with which\nhe opened that precursor of the Prussian Chambers, and the address showed\nhim in fact to be an excellent orator.\n\nTo him, believing as he did with the most complete conviction in\nroyalty by the grace of God and in his calling by higher powers, any\nrelinquishing of his prerogative would seem like a betrayal of his divine\nmission.  The expression he uttered in the Assembly in the course of his\nspeech--\"I and my people will serve the Lord\"--came from the very depths\nof his heart; and nothing could be more sincerely meant than the remark,\n\"From one weakness I know myself to be absolutely free: I do not strive\nfor vain public favour.  My only effort is to do my duty to the best of\nmy knowledge and according to my conscience, and to deserve the gratitude\nof my people, though it should be denied me.\"\n\nThe last words have a foreboding sound, and prove what is indeed evident\nfrom many other expressions--that he had begun to experience in his own\nperson the truth of the remark he had made when full of hope, and hailed\nwith joyful anticipations at his coronation--\"The path of a king is full\nof sorrow, unless his people stand by him with loyal heart and mind.\"\n\nHis people did not do that, and it was well for them; for the path\nindicated by the royal hand would have led them to darkness and to the\nindignity of ever-increasing bondage, mental and temporal.\n\nThe prince himself is entitled to the deepest sympathy.  He wished to do\nright, and was endowed with great and noble gifts which would have done\nhonour to a private individual, but could not suffice for the ruler of a\npowerful state in difficult times.\n\nHardly had the king opened the General Assembly in April, 1848, and, for\nthe relief of distress among the poorer classes in the capital, repealed\nthe town dues on corn, when the first actual evidences of discontent\nbroke out.  The town tax was so strictly enforced at that time at all\nthe gates of Berlin that even hacks entering the city were stopped and\nsearched for provisions of meat or bread--a search which was usually\nconducted in a cursory and courteous manner.\n\nIn my sister Paula's journal I have an almost daily account of that\nperiod, with frequent reference to political events, but it is not my\ntask to write a history of the Berlin revolution.\n\nThose of my sister's records which refer to the revolutionary period\nbegin with a mention of the so-called potato revolution, which occurred\nten days after the opening of the General Assembly, though it had no\nconnection with it.\n\n     [Excessive prices had been asked for a peck of potatoes, which\n     enraged the purchasers, who threw them into the gutter and laid\n     hands on some of the market-women.  The assembled crowd then\n     plundered some bakers' and butchers' shops, and was finally\n     dispersed by the military.  A certain Herr Winckler is said\n     to have lost his life.  Many windows were broken, etc.]\n\nThis riot took place on the 21st of April, and on the 2d of May Paula\nalludes to a performance at the opera-house, which Ludo and I attended.\nIt was the last appearance of Fran Viardot Garcia as Iphigenia, but I\nfear Paula is right in saying that the great singer did her best for an\nungrateful public, for the attention of the audience was directed chiefly\nto the king and queen.  The latter appeared in the theatre for the first\ntime since a severe illness, the enthusiasm was great, and there was no\nend to the cries of \"Long live the king and queen!\" which were repeated\nbetween every act.\n\nI relate the circumstance to show with what a devoted and faithful\naffection the people of Berlin still clung to the royal pair.  On the\nother hand, their regard for the Prince of Prussia, afterward Emperor\nWilliam, was already shaken.  He who alone remained firm when all about\nthe king were wavering, was regarded as the embodiment of military rule,\nagainst which a violent opposition was rising.\n\nOur mother was even then devoted to him with a reverence which bordered\nupon affection, and we children with her.\n\nWe felt more familiar with him, too; than with any other members of the\nruling house, for Fraulein Lamperi, who was in a measure like one of our\nown family, was always relating the most attractive stories about him and\nhis noble spouse, whose waiting-woman she had been.\n\nOf Frederick William IV it was generally jokes that were told, some of\nthem very witty ones.  We once came in contact with him in a singular\nway.\n\nOur old cook, Frau Marx, who called herself \"the Marxen,\" was nearly\nblind, and wished to enter an institution, for which it was necessary to\nhave his Majesty's consent.  Many years before, when she was living in a\ncount's family, she had taught the king, as a young prince, to churn, and\non the strength of this a petition was drawn up for her by my family.\nThis she handed into the king's carriage, in the palace court-yard, and\nto his question who she was, she replied,  \"Why, I'm old Marxen, and your\nMajesty is my last retreat.\"  This speech was repeated to my mother by\nthe adjutant who came to inquire about the petitioner, and he assured her\nthat his Majesty had been greatly amused by the old woman's singular\nchoice of words, and had repeated it several times to persons about him.\nHer wish was fulfilled at once.\n\nThe memory of those March days of 1848 is impressed on my soul in\nineffaceable characters.  More beautiful weather I never knew.  It seemed\nas if May had taken the place of its stormy predecessor.  From the 13th\nthe sun shone constantly from a cloudless sky, and on the 18th the fruit-\ntrees in our garden were in full bloom.  Whoever was not kept in the\nhouse by duty or sickness was eager to be out.  The public gardens were\nfilled by afternoon, and whoever wanted to address the people had no need\nto call an audience together.  Whatever rancour, indignation, discontent,\nand sorrow had lurked under ground now came forth, and the buds of\nlonging and joyful expectation hourly unfolded in greater strength and\nfuller bloom.\n\nThe news of the Paris revolution, whose confirmation had reached Berlin\nin the last few days of February, had caused all this growth and\nblossoming like sunshine and warm rain.  There was no repressing it, and\nthe authorities felt daily more and more that their old measures of\nrestraint were failing.\n\nThe accounts from Paris were accompanied by report after report from the\nrest of Germany, shaking the old structure of absolutism like the\nrepeated shocks of a battering-ram.\n\nFreedom of the press was not yet granted, but tongues had begun to move\nfreely-indeed, often without any restraint.  As early as the 7th of\nMarch, and in bad weather, too, meetings began to be held in tents.  As\nsoon as the fine spring days came we found great crowds listening to\nbearded orators, who told them of the revolution in Paris and of the\naddresses to the king--how they had passed hither and thither, and how\nthey had been received.  They had all contained very much the same\ndemands--freedom of the press, representatives of the people to be chosen\nby free election, all religious confessions to be placed on an equal\nfooting in the exercise of political rights, and representation of the\npeople in the German Confederacy.\n\nThese demands were discussed with fiery zeal, and the royal promise, just\ngiven, of calling together the Assembly again and issuing a law on the\npress, after the Confederate Diet should have been moved to a similar\nmeasure, was condemned in strong terms as an insufficient and half-way\nprocedure--a payment on account, in order to gain time.\n\nOn the 15th the particulars of the Vienna revolution and Metternich's\nflight reached Berlin; and we, too, learned the news, and heard our\nmother and her friends asking anxiously, \"How will this end?\"\n\nUnspeakable excitement had taken possession of young and old--at home,\nin the street, and at school--for blood had already flowed in the city.\nOn the 13th, cavalry had dispersed a crowd in the vicinity of the palace,\nand the same thing was repeated on the two following days.  Fortunately,\nfew were injured; but rumour, ever ready to increase and enhance the\nhorrible desire of many fanatics to stir up the fire of discontent, had\nconspired to make wounded men dead ones, and slight injuries severe.\n\nThese exaggerations ran through the city, arousing indignation; and the\ncorrespondents of foreign papers, knowing that readers often like best\nwhat is most incredible, had sent the accounts to the provinces and\nforeign countries."}
{"ID": 693, "text": "She instantly got up and dressed our Babies,\nwhile I made a fire, and the first Nobility in the land never made a more comfortable meal.--We\ndid not forget to thank the LORD for all his goodness to us.--Soon after this, as the spring\ncame on, Mr. Peter _Daniel_ employed me in helping to pull down a house, and rebuilding it.\nI had then very good work, and full employ: he sent for my wife, and children to _Colchester_,\nand provided us a house where we lived very comfortably.--I hope I shall always gratefully\nacknowledge his kindness to myself and family. I worked at this house for more than a year,\ntill it was finished; and after that I was employed by several successively, and was never\nso happy as when I had something to do; but perceiving the winter coming on, and work rather\nslack, I was apprehensive that we should again be in want or become troublesome to our friends.\n\nI had at this time an offer made me of going to _Norwich_ and having constant employ.--My wife\nseemed pleased with this proposal, as she supposed she might get work there in the weaving-manufactory,\nbeing the business she was brought up to, and more likely to succeed there than any other place;\nand we thought as we had an opportunity of moving to a Town where we could both be employ'd\nit was most adviseable to do so; and that probably we might settle there for our lives.--When\nthis step was resolv'd on, I went first alone to see how it would answer; which I very much\nrepented after, for it was not in my power immediately to send my wife any supply, as I fell\ninto the hands of a Master that was neither kind nor considerate; and she was reduced to great\ndistress, so that she was oblig'd to sell the few goods that we had, and when I sent for her\nwas under the disagreeable necessity of parting with our bed.\n\nWhen she came to _Norwich_ I hired a room ready furnished.--I experienced a great deal of difference\nin the carriage of my Master from what I had been accustomed to from some of my other Masters.\nHe was very irregular in his payments to me.--My wife hired a loom and wove all the leisure\ntime she had and we began to do very well, till we were overtaken by fresh misfortunes.

{"ID": 1447, "text": "The\nEnglish had been among the earliest successors of Columbus.\nBritish ships, commanded by the Venetian pilot Giovanni Caboto\n(or Cabot), had been the first to discover and explore the\nnorthern American continent in 1496. Labrador and Newfoundland\nwere of little importance as a possible colony. But\nthe banks of Newfoundland offered a rich reward to the\nEnglish fishing fleet. A year later, in 1497, the same Cabot\nhad explored the coast of Florida.\n\nThen had come the busy years of Henry VII and Henry\nVIII when there had been no money for foreign explorations.\nBut under Elizabeth, with the country at peace and Mary\nStuart in prison, the sailors could leave their harbour without\nfear for the fate of those whom they left behind. While Elizabeth\nwas still a child, Willoughby had ventured to sail past the\nNorth Cape and one of his captains, Richard Chancellor, pushing\nfurther eastward in his quest of a possible road to the Indies,\nhad reached Archangel, Russia, where he had established\ndiplomatic and commercial relations with the mysterious rulers\nof this distant Muscovite Empire. During the first years of\nElizabeth's rule this voyage had been followed up by many\nothers. Merchant adventurers, working for the benefit of a\n``joint stock Company'' had laid the foundations of trading\ncompanies which in later centuries were to become colonies.\nHalf pirate, half diplomat, willing to stake everything on a\nsingle lucky voyage, smugglers of everything that could be\nloaded into the hold of a vessel, dealers in men and merchandise\nwith equal indifference to everything except their profit, the\nsailors of Elizabeth had carried the English flag and the fame\nof their Virgin Queen to the four corners of the Seven Seas.\nMeanwhile William Shakespeare kept her Majesty amused at\nhome, and the best brains and the best wit of England co-operated\nwith the queen in her attempt to change the feudal inheritance\nof Henry VIII into a modern national state.\n\nIn the year 1603 the old lady died at the age of seventy.\nHer cousin, the great-grandson of her own grandfather Henry\nVII and son of Mary Stuart, her rival and enemy, succeeded\nher as James I. By the Grace of God, he found himself the\nruler of a country which had escaped the fate of its continental\nrivals. While the European Protestants and Catholics were\nkilling each other in a hopeless attempt to break the power of\ntheir adversaries and establish the exclusive rule of their own\nparticular creed, England was at peace and ``reformed'' at\nleisure without going to the extremes of either Luther or\nLoyola. It gave the island kingdom an enormous advantage in\nthe coming struggle for colonial possessions. It assured England\na leadership in international affairs which that country\nhas maintained until the present day. Not even the disastrous\nadventure with the Stuarts was able to stop this normal development.\n\nThe Stuarts, who succeeded the Tudors, were ``foreigners''\nin England. They do not seem to have appreciated or understood\nthis fact. The native house of Tudor could steal a horse,\nbut the ``foreign'' Stuarts were not allowed to look at the\nbridle without causing great popular disapproval. Old Queen\nBess had ruled her domains very much as she pleased. In\ngeneral however, she had always followed a policy which meant\nmoney in the pocket of the honest (and otherwise) British\nmerchants. Hence the Queen had been always assured of the\nwholehearted support of her grateful people. And small liberties\ntaken with some of the rights and prerogatives of Parliament\nwere gladly overlooked for the ulterior benefits which\nwere derived from her Majesty's strong and successful foreign\npolicies.\n\nOutwardly King James continued the same policy. But he\nlacked that personal enthusiasm which had been so very typical\nof his great predecessor. Foreign commerce continued to be\nencouraged. The Catholics were not granted any liberties.\nBut when Spain smiled pleasantly upon England in an effort\nto establish peaceful relations, James was seen to smile back.\nThe majority of the English people did not like this, but\nJames was their King and they kept quiet.\n\nSoon there were other causes of friction. King James and\nhis son, Charles I, who succeeded him in the year 1625 both\nfirmly believed in the principle of their ``divine right'' to\nadminister their realm as they thought fit without consulting the\nwishes of their subjects. The idea was not new. The Popes,\nwho in more than one way had been the successors of the\nRoman Emperors (or rather of the Roman Imperial ideal of\na single and undivided state covering the entire known world),\nhad always regarded themselves and had been publicly recognised\nas the ``Vice-Regents of Christ upon Earth.'' No one\nquestioned the right of God to rule the world as He saw fit.\nAs a natural result, few ventured to doubt the right of the\ndivine ``Vice-Regent'' to do the same thing and to demand the\nobedience of the masses because he was the direct representative\nof the Absolute Ruler of the Universe and responsible\nonly to Almighty God.\n\nWhen the Lutheran Reformation proved successful, those\nrights which formerly had been invested in the Papacy were\ntaken over by the many European sovereigns who became\nProtestants. As head of their own national or dynastic\nchurches they insisted upon being ``Christ's Vice-Regents''\nwithin the limit of their own territory. The people did not question\nthe right of their rulers to take such a step. They accepted\nit, just as we in our own day accept the idea of a representative\nsystem which to us seems the only reasonable and just\nform of government. It is unfair therefore to state that either\nLutheranism or Calvinism caused the particular feeling of\nirritation which greeted King-James's oft and loudly repeated\nassertion of his ``Divine Right.'' There must have been other\ngrounds for the genuine English disbelief in the Divine Right\nof Kings.\n\nThe first positive denial of the ``Divine Right'' of sovereigns\nhad been heard in the Netherlands when the Estates General\nabjured their lawful sovereign King Philip II of Spain, in the\nyear 1581. ``The King,'' so they said, ``has broken his contract\nand the King therefore is dismissed like any other unfaithful\nservant.'' Since then, this particular idea of a king's\nresponsibilities towards his subjects had spread among many of the\nnations who inhabited the shores of the North Sea. They were\nin a very favourable position. They were rich. The poor people\nin the heart of central Europe, at the mercy of their\nRuler's body-guard, could not afford to discuss a problem\nwhich would at once land them in the deepest dungeon of the\nnearest castle. But the merchants of Holland and England\nwho possessed the capital necessary for the maintenance of\ngreat armies and navies, who knew how to handle the almighty\nweapon called ``credit,'' had no such fear. They were willing\nto pit the ``Divine Right'' of their own good money against\nthe ``Divine Right'' of any Habsburg or Bourbon or Stuart.\nThey knew that their guilders and shillings could beat the\nclumsy feudal armies which were the only weapons of the King.\nThey dared to act, where others were condemned to suffer\nin silence or run the risk of the scaffold.\n\nWhen the Stuarts began to annoy the people of England\nwith their claim that they had a right to do what they pleased\nand never mind the responsibility, the English middle classes\nused the House of Commons as their first line of defence\nagainst this abuse of the Royal Power. The Crown refused to\ngive in and the King sent Parliament about its own business.\nEleven long years, Charles I ruled alone. He levied taxes\nwhich most people regarded as illegal and he managed his\nBritish kingdom as if it had been his own country estate. He\nhad capable assistants and we must say that he had the courage\nof his convictions.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of assuring himself of the support\nof his faithful Scottish subjects, Charles became involved in\na quarrel with the Scotch Presbyterians. Much against his\nwill, but forced by his need for ready cash, Charles was at\nlast obliged to call Parliament together once more. It met in\nApril of 1640 and showed an ugly temper. It was dissolved\na few weeks later. A new Parliament convened in November.\nThis one was even less pliable than the first one. The members\nunderstood that the question of ``Government by Divine\nRight'' or ``Government by Parliament'' must be fought out\nfor good and all. They attacked the King in his chief councillors\nand executed half a dozen of them. They announced that\nthey would not allow themselves to be dissolved without their\nown approval. Finally on December 1, 1641, they presented\nto the King a ``Grand Remonstrance'' which gave a detailed\naccount of the many grievances of the people against their Ruler.\n\nCharles, hoping to derive some support for his own policy\nin the country districts, left London in January of 1642. Each\nside organised an army and prepared for open warfare between\nthe absolute power of the crown and the absolute power\nof Parliament. During this struggle, the most powerful religious\nelement of England, called the Puritans, (they were\nAnglicans who had tried to purify their doctrines to the most\nabsolute limits), came quickly to the front. The regiments of\n``Godly men,'' commanded by Oliver Cromwell, with their\niron discipline and their profound confidence in the holiness of\ntheir aims, soon became the model for the entire army of the\nopposition. Twice Charles was defeated. After the battle\nof Naseby, in 1645, he fled to Scotland. The Scotch sold him\nto the English.\n\nThere followed a period of intrigue and an uprising\nof the Scotch Presbyterians against the English Puritan.\nIn August of the year 1648 after the three-days' battle of\nPreston Pans, Cromwell made an end to this second civil war,\nand took Edinburgh. Meanwhile his soldiers, tired of further\ntalk and wasted hours of religious debate, had decided to act\non their own initiative. They removed from Parliament all\nthose who did not agree with their own Puritan views. Thereupon\nthe ``Rump,'' which was what was left of the old Parliament,\naccused the King of high treason. The House of Lords\nrefused to sit as a tribunal. A special tribunal was appointed\nand it condemned the King to death. On the 30th of January\nof the year 1649, King Charles walked quietly out of a window\nof White Hall onto the scaffold. That day, the Sovereign\nPeople, acting through their chosen representatives, for the\nfirst time executed a ruler who had failed to understand his own\nposition in the modern state.\n\nThe period which followed the death of Charles is usually\ncalled after Oliver Cromwell. At first the unofficial Dictator\nof England, he was officially made Lord Protector in the year\n1653. He ruled five years. He used this period to continue\nthe policies of Elizabeth. Spain once more became the arch\nenemy of England and war upon the Spaniard was made a national\nand sacred issue.\n\nThe commerce of England and the interests of the traders\nwere placed before everything else, and the Protestant creed of\nthe strictest nature was rigourously maintained. In maintaining\nEngland's position abroad, Cromwell was successful. As a\nsocial reformer, however, he failed very badly. The world is\nmade up of a number of people and they rarely think alike.\nIn the long run, this seems a very wise provision. A government\nof and by and for one single part of the entire community\ncannot possibly survive. The Puritans had been a great\nforce for good when they tried to correct the abuse of the\nroyal power. As the absolute Rulers of England they became\nintolerable.\n\nWhen Cromwell died in 1658, it was an easy matter for the\nStuarts to return to their old kingdom. Indeed, they were\nwelcomed as ``deliverers'' by the people who had found the\nyoke of the meek Puritans quite as hard to bear as that of autocratic\nKing Charles. Provided the Stuarts were willing to forget\nabout the Divine Right of their late and lamented father\nand were willing to recognise the superiority of Parliament, the\npeople promised that they would be loyal and faithful subjects.\n\nTwo generations tried to make a success of this new arrangement.\nBut the Stuarts apparently had not learned their\nlesson and were unable to drop their bad habits. Charles II,\nwho came back in the year 1660, was an amiable but worthless\nperson. His indolence and his constitutional insistence upon\nfollowing the easiest course, together with his conspicuous success\nas a liar, prevented an open outbreak between himself and\nhis people. By the act of Uniformity in 1662 he broke the\npower of the Puritan clergy by banishing all dissenting clergymen\nfrom their parishes. By the so-called Conventicle Act of\n1664 he tried to prevent the Dissenters from attending religious\nmeetings by a threat of deportation to the West Indies. This\nlooked too much like the good old days of Divine Right. People\nbegan to show the old and well-known signs of impatience,\nand Parliament suddenly experienced difficulty in providing\nthe King with funds.\n\nSince he could not get money from an unwilling Parliament,\nCharles borrowed it secretly from his neighbour and cousin\nKing Louis of France. He betrayed his Protestant allies in\nreturn for 200,000 pounds per year, and laughed at the poor\nsimpletons of Parliament.\n\nEconomic independence suddenly gave the King great faith\nin his own strength. He had spent many years of exile among\nhis Catholic relations and he had a secret liking for their\nreligion. Perhaps he could bring England back to Rome! He\npassed a Declaration of Indulgence which suspended the old\nlaws against the Catholics and Dissenters. This happened just\nwhen Charles' younger brother James was said to have become\na Catholic. All this looked suspicious to the man in the street\nPeople began to fear some terrible Popish plot. A new spirit\nof unrest entered the land. Most of the people wanted to prevent\nanother outbreak of civil war. To them Royal Oppression\nand a Catholic King--yea, even Divine Right,--were\npreferable to a new struggle between members of the same\nrace. Others however were less lenient. They were the much-\nfeared Dissenters, who invariably had the courage of their\nconvictions. They were led by several great noblemen who did\nnot want to see a return of the old days of absolute royal\npower.\n\nFor almost ten years, these two great parties, the Whigs\n(the middle class element, called by this derisive name be-\ncause in the year 1640 a lot of Scottish Whiggamores or horse-\ndrovers headed by the Presbyterian clergy, had marched to\nEdinburgh to oppose the King) and the Tories (an epithet\noriginally used against the Royalist Irish adherents but now\napplied to the supporters of the King) opposed each other, but\nneither wished to bring about a crisis. They allowed Charles to\ndie peacefully in his bed and permitted the Catholic James II\nto succeed his brother in 1685. But when James, after threatening\nthe country with the terrible foreign invention of a ``standing\narmy'' (which was to be commanded by Catholic Frenchmen),\nissued a second Declaration of Indulgence in 1688, and\nordered it to be read in all Anglican churches, he went just a\ntrifle beyond that line of sensible demarcation which can only be\ntransgressed by the most popular of rulers under very\nexceptional circumstances. Seven bishops refused to comply\nwith the Royal Command. They were accused of ``seditious\nlibel.'' They were brought before a court. The jury which\npronounced the verdict of ``not guilty'' reaped a rich harvest\nof popular approval.\n\nAt this unfortunate moment, James (who in a second marriage\nhad taken to wife Maria of the Catholic house of Modena-\nEste) became the father of a son. This meant that the throne\nwas to go to a Catholic boy rather than to his older sisters,\nMary and Anne, who were Protestants. The man in the street\nagain grew suspicious. Maria of Modena was too old to have\nchildren! It was all part of a plot! A strange baby had been\nbrought into the palace by some Jesuit priest that England\nmight have a Catholic monarch. And so on. It looked as if\nanother civil war would break out. Then seven well-known\nmen, both Whigs and Tories, wrote a letter asking the husband\nof James's oldest daughter Mary, William III the Stadtholder\nor head of the Dutch Republic, to come to England and\ndeliver the country from its lawful but entirely undesirable\nsovereign.\n\nOn the fifth of November of the year 1688, William landed\nat Torbay. As he did not wish to make a martyr out of his\nfather-in-law, he helped him to escape safely to France. On\nthe 22nd of January of 1689 he summoned Parliament. On\nthe 13th of February of the same year he and his wife Mary\nwere proclaimed joint sovereigns of England and the country\nwas saved for the Protestant cause.\n\nParliament, having undertaken to be something more than\na mere advisory body to the King, made the best of its\nopportunities. The old Petition of Rights of the year 1628 was\nfished out of a forgotten nook of the archives. A second and\nmore drastic Bill of Rights demanded that the sovereign of\nEngland should belong to the Anglican church. Furthermore\nit stated that the king had no right to suspend the laws or\npermit certain privileged citizens to disobey certain laws. It\nstipulated that ``without consent of Parliament no taxes could\nbe levied and no army could be maintained.'' Thus in the year\n1689 did England acquire an amount of liberty unknown in\nany other country of Europe.\n\nBut it is not only on account of this great liberal measure\nthat the rule of William in England is still remembered. During\nhis lifetime, government by a ``responsible'' ministry first\ndeveloped. No king of course can rule alone. He needs a few\ntrusted advisors. The Tudors had their Great Council which\nwas composed of Nobles and Clergy. This body grew too\nlarge. It was restricted to the small ``Privy Council.'' In the\ncourse of time it became the custom of these councillors to meet\nthe king in a cabinet in the palace. Hence they were called\nthe ``Cabinet Council.'' After a short while they were known\nas the ``Cabinet.''\n\nWilliam, like most English sovereigns before him, had\nchosen his advisors from among all parties. But with the increased\nstrength of Parliament, he had found it impossible to\ndirect the politics of the country with the help of the Tories\nwhile the Whigs had a majority in the house of Commons.\nTherefore the Tories had been dismissed and the Cabinet Council\nhad been composed entirely of Whigs. A few years later\nwhen the Whigs lost their power in the House of Commons, the\nking, for the sake of convenience, was obliged to look for his\nsupport among the leading Tories. Until his death in 1702,\nWilliam was too busy fighting Louis of France to bother much\nabout the government of England. Practically all important\naffairs had been left to his Cabinet Council. When William's\nsister-in-law, Anne, succeeded him in 1702 this condition of\naffairs continued. When she died in 1714 (and unfortunately\nnot a single one of her seventeen children survived her) the\nthrone went to George I of the House of Hanover, the son of\nSophie, grand-daughter of James I.\n\nThis somewhat rustic monarch, who never learned a word\nof English, was entirely lost in the complicated mazes of England's\npolitical arrangements. He left everything to his Cabinet\nCouncil and kept away from their meetings, which bored\nhim as he did not understand a single sentence. In this way\nthe Cabinet got into the habit of ruling England and Scotland\n(whose Parliament had been joined to that of England\nin 1707) without bothering the King, who was apt to spend\na great deal of his time on the continent.\n\nDuring the reign of George I and George II, a succession of\ngreat Whigs (of whom one, Sir Robert Walpole, held office for\ntwenty-one years) formed the Cabinet Council of the King.\nTheir leader was finally recognised as the official leader not\nonly of the actual Cabinet but also of the majority party in\npower in Parliament. The attempts of George III to take\nmatters into his own hands and not to leave the actual business\nof government to his Cabinet were so disastrous that\nthey were never repeated. And from the earliest years of the\neighteenth century on, England enjoyed representative government,\nwith a responsible ministry which conducted the affairs\nof the land.\n\nTo be quite true, this government did not represent all\nclasses of society. Less than one man in a dozen had the right\nto vote. But it was the foundation for the modern representative\nform of government. In a quiet and orderly fashion it\ntook the power away from the King and placed it in the hands\nof an ever increasing number of popular representatives. It did\nnot bring the millenium to England, but it saved that country\nfrom most of the revolutionary outbreaks which proved so\ndisastrous to the European continent in the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries.\n\n\nTHE BALANCE OF POWER\n\nIN FRANCE ON THE OTHER HAND THE ``DIVINE\nRIGHT OF KINGS'' CONTINUED WITH\nGREATER POMP AND SPLENDOUR THAN\nEVER BEFORE AND THE AMBITION OF\nTHE RULER WAS ONLY TEMPERED BY\nTHE NEWLY INVENTED LAW OF THE\n``BALANCE OF POWER''\n\n\nAs a contrast to the previous chapter, let me tell you what\nhappened in France during the years when the English people\nwere fighting for their liberty. The happy combination\nof the right man in the right country at the right moment is very\nrare in History. Louis XIV was a realisation of this ideal, as\nfar as France was concerned, but the rest of Europe would\nhave been happier without him.\n\nThe country over which the young king was called to rule\nwas the most populous and the most brilliant nation of that\nday. Louis came to the throne when Mazarin and Richelieu,\nthe two great Cardinals, had just hammered the ancient French\nKingdom into the most strongly centralised state of the seventeenth\ncentury. He was himself a man of extraordinary ability.\nWe, the people of the twentieth century, are still\nsurrounded by the memories of the glorious age of the Sun King.\nOur social life is based upon the perfection of manners and the\nelegance of expression attained at the court of Louis. In\ninternational and diplomatic relations, French is still the official\nlanguage of diplomacy and international gatherings because\ntwo centuries ago it reached a polished elegance and a purity\nof expression which no other tongue had as yet been able to\nequal. The theatre of King Louis still teaches us lessons\nwhich we are only too slow in learning. During his reign the\nFrench Academy (an invention of Richelieu) came to occupy\na position in the world of letters which other countries have\nflattered by their imitation. We might continue this list for\nmany pages. It is no matter of mere chance that our modern\nbill-of-fare is printed in French. The very difficult art of\ndecent cooking, one of the highest expressions of civilisation,\nwas first practiced for the benefit of the great Monarch. The\nage of Louis XIV was a time of splendour and grace which can\nstill teach us a lot.\n\nUnfortunately this brilliant picture has another side which\nwas far less encouraging. Glory abroad too often means\nmisery at home, and France was no exception to this rule\nLouis XIV succeeded his father in the year 1643. He died in\nthe year 1715. That means that the government of France\nwas in the hands of one single man for seventy-two years,\nalmost two whole generations.\n\nIt will be well to get a firm grasp of this idea, ``one single\nman.'' Louis was the first of a long list of monarchs who in\nmany countries established that particular form of highly efficient\nautocracy which we call ``enlightened despotism.'' He\ndid not like kings who merely played at being rulers and\nturned official affairs into a pleasant picnic. The Kings of\nthat enlightened age worked harder than any of their subjects.\nThey got up earlier and went to bed later than anybody else,\nand felt their ``divine responsibility'' quite as strongly as their\n``divine right'' which allowed them to rule without consulting\ntheir subjects.\n\nOf course, the king could not attend to everything in person.\nHe was obliged to surround himself with a few helpers\nand councillors. One or two generals, some experts upon foreign\npolitics, a few clever financiers and economists would do\nfor this purpose. But these dignitaries could act only through\ntheir Sovereign. They had no individual existence. To the\nmass of the people, the Sovereign actually represented in his\nown sacred person the government of their country. The\nglory of the common fatherland became the glory of a single\ndynasty. It meant the exact opposite of our own American\nideal. France was ruled of and by and for the House of Bourbon.\n\nThe disadvantages of such a system are clear. The King\ngrew to be everything. Everybody else grew to be nothing at\nall. The old and useful nobility was gradually forced to give\nup its former shares in the government of the provinces. A little\nRoyal bureaucrat, his fingers splashed with ink, sitting behind\nthe greenish windows of a government building in faraway\nParis, now performed the task which a hundred years\nbefore had been the duty of the feudal Lord. The feudal Lord,\ndeprived of all work, moved to Paris to amuse himself as best\nhe could at the court. Soon his estates began to suffer from\nthat very dangerous economic sickness, known as ``Absentee\nLandlordism.'' Within a single generation, the industrious\nand useful feudal administrators had become the well-mannered\nbut quite useless loafers of the court of Versailles.\n\nLouis was ten years old when the peace of Westphalia was\nconcluded and the House of Habsburg, as a result of the\nThirty Years War, lost its predominant position in Europe."}

But the kindly physician,\nwho gladly aided even the poorest sufferer, curtly and positively refused.

{"ID": 582, "text": "\n \nMr. Shortt, M. P., begged to suggest, as a matter of business,\nthat for the present the child was not capable of receiving any\nideas whatever, and might die, or prove to be dumb, or an idiot,\nand so require no education.  Ought they not to postpone this\ndiscussion until the subject was old enough to be worth\nconsideration? \n \nIt was Mr. Shortt's habit to show his practical vein by\nbusiness-like obstructions of this kind.  He had been able a\nscore of times to demonstrate to the House of Commons how silly\nit was to consider probabilities.  In fact, he was opposed heart\nand soul to prophetic legislation; he would live, legislatively,\nfrom hand to mouth. \n \nBut the committee would not allow Mr. Shortt to run away with the\nbone of contention. \n \nThe Rev. Dr. M'Gregor Lucas, of the National Caledonian\nBelievers, had been silent too long to contain himself further. \nThis man needs some particular description whenever his name is\nmade public.  Nay, for this he lives, and by it, some think.  At\nall events, he appears to be equally eager for rebuke and\napplause; they both involve notoriety, and notoriety is sure to\npay.  Few absurdities had been overlooked by his shallow\ningenuity.  Simply to have invested his limited mental endowments\nin trying to make the world believe him a genius, would have been\nonly so like what many thousands are doing as to have absolved\nhim from too harsh a judgment; but he traded in perilous stuff. \nCheap prophecy was his staple.  It was his wont to give out about\nonce in five years, that the world would shortly come to an end,\nand, like Mr. Zadkiel, he found people who thought their\ninevitable disappointment a proof of his inspiration.  Had you\nheard the honeyed words dropping from his lips, you would have\ntaken him for a Scotch angel, and, consequently, a rarity.  Could\nsuch lips utter harsh sayings, or distil vanities?  Show him a\npriest, and you would hear!  The Pope was his particular born\nfoe; Popery his enemies' country--so he said.  It was safe for\nhim to stand and throw his darts.  No one could say whether they\nhit or did not; while most spectators had the good will to hope\nthat they did.  How he would have lived if Daniel and St. John\nhad dreamed no dreams, one cannot conjecture.  As it was, they\nprovided the doctor with endless openings for his fancy.  Since\nno one could solve the riddle of their prophecies, it was certain\nthat no one could disprove his solutions.  Yet these came so\noften to their own disproof by lapse of time, that I can only\nthink that the good doctor hoped to die before his critical\nperiods came, or was so clever as to trust the infallibility of\nhuman weakness. \n \nI describe Dr. Lucas at so great a length, because it will be\neasier and more edifying to the reader to conceive what he said,\nthan for me to recount it.  He showed the Baby to be one of seven\nmysteries.  He was in favor of teaching him at once to hate\nidolatry, music, crosses, masses, nuns, priests, bishops, and\ncardinals.  The \"humanities,\" the Shorter Catechism, the\nConfession of Faith, and \"The whole Duty of Man,\" would, in his\nopinion, be the books to lay the groundwork in the child's mind\nof a Christian character of the highest type. \n \nMr. Ogle, M. P., here vigorously intervened.  Said he:-- \n \n\"I can't, with all deference, agree to any of these suggestions. \nThey involve hand-to-hand fighting over this baby's body.  No one\nof us is entitled to take charge of him.  Else why did we all\nunite to rescue him from the nunnery?  He will be torn to pieces\namong contending divines!  I think a purely secular education is\nall that as a committee we should aim at.  We have, but just\nwithdrawn the child from the shadow of a single ecclesiastical\ninfluence--would you transfer it to another?  Every Protestant\ndenomination is contributing to his support, how can you devote\ntheir gifts to rearing him for one?  You would have no peace;\nbetter at once treat him as the man of Benjamin treated his wife,\ncut him up into enough pieces to send to all the tribes of\nIsrael, summoning them to the fight.  I say we have nothing to do\nwith this just now; let him be educated in a secular academy, and\nlet each sect be free to send its agents to instruct him out of\nschool hours as they please.\" \n \nThe Rev. Theodoret Verity, M.A., rose in anger. \n \n\"Surely, sir, you cannot seriously propound such a scheme!  Would\nyou leave this precious waif to be buffeted between the\ncontending waves of truth and error, in the vague hope that by\nsome lucky wind he might finally be cast upon a rock of safety? \nI protest against all these educational heresies--they are\nredolent of brimstone.  Truth is truth, or there is none at all. \nIf there be any, it is our duty to impart it to this immortal at\nthe outset of his existence.  Secular education!  What do you\nmean by it?  Who shall sever one question from another, and call\none secular and the other religious?  Is not every relation and\nevery truth in some way or other connected with religion?\" &c.\n&c. Mr. Verity has been saying the same thing any time these\nforty years. \n \n\"Forgive me,\" replied Mr. Ogle, \"if I say that this is very vague\ntalking.  I have not proposed to sever one question from another. \nI only propose to do in a different way that which is being done\nnow by the most rigid of Mr. Verity's friends.  It is impossible\nto comprehend what is meant by such a statement as that every\ntruth is somehow connected with religion.  It may be\nthat the notion--if it really is not, as I suspect it to be, mere\nverbiage and clap-trap, used by certain fools to mislead\nothers--means that there is some such coherency between all\ntruths as there is, for instance, between the elements of the\nbody.  I would admit that, but is not blood a different and\nperfectly severable thing from bone?  Each has its place, office,\nrelation.  But who would say that one could not be regarded by a\nphysicist in the largest variety of its aspects apart from the\nother?  Yet the physicist comes back again to consider with\nrespect to each its relations to all the rest!  The separate\nstudy has rather prepared him for more profound insight into\nthose relations.  Thus it is with the body of truth.  In spite of\nMr. Verity I affirm that there are truths that have not in\nthemselves any element of religion whatever.  The forty-seventh\nproposition of Euclid will be taught by a Jesuit precisely as it\nis taught in the London University; geography will affirm certain\nprinciples and designate places, rivers, mountains--that no faith\ncan remove and cast into unknown seas.  These subjects and others\nare taught in our most bigoted schools in separate hours and\nrelations from religion.  What then do you mean by affirming that\nthere can be no secular education of this child--apart from\nreligious teaching?  We are not likely to agree, if I may judge\nfrom what I have seen, on any one method of religious instruction\nfor it, therefore I wish first to fix common bounds within which\nour common benevolence may work.  Well, we all go to the Bible. \nWe agree that between its covers lies religious truth somewhere. \nIf you like let him have that--and let him have some kindly and\nholy influences about him in the way of practice and example,\nsuch as many of our sects can supply many instances of.  Give him\nno catechism--let him read a creed in our daily life.  The\narticles of faith strongest in his soul will be those which have\ncrystallized there from the combined action of truth and\nexperience, and not as it were been pasted on its walls by\necclesiastical bill-posters.  'What is truth?' he must ask and\nanswer for himself, as we all must do before God.  Don't mistake\nme; I hope I am not more indifferent to religion than any here\npresent--but I differ from them on the best method of imbuing the\nmind and heart with it.  Surely we need not, we cannot--it would\nbe an exquisite absurdity--pass a resolution in this committee\nthat the child is to be a Calvinist!  Who then would agree to\nsecure him from any taint of Arminian heresy in years to come?\nDare you even resolve that he shall be a Christian and a\nProtestant!  I would not insure the risk.  But, with so many of\nChrist's followers about me, surely, surely without providing any\necclesiastical mechanism, there will be testified to him simply\nhow he may be saved.  Your prayers, your visits, your kindly\nmoral influence and talk, your living example of a goodness\nderived not from dogmas but from affectionate following of a holy\npattern and trust in revealed mercies, your pointing to that\npattern and showing the daily passage of these mercies will\nprompt his search after the truth that has made you what you are. \nLet some good woman do for him a mother's part, but choose her\nfor her general goodness and not for the dogmas of her church. \nThe simpler her piety the better for him I should say!\" \n \nThis straightforward speech fell like a new apple of discord in\nthe midst of the committee.  Angry knots were formed, and the\nnoble chairman found that he could not restore order.  An\nadjournment was agreed to.  Luckily for the body of Ginx's Baby,\nhe had been meanwhile sent to a home where Protestant money\nsecured to him for the time good living, while his benefactors\nwere discussing what to do with his soul. \n \n-------- \n \n \nSurely, it were no impertinence to interrupt this history and\nadvert to the fact, that, in the discussion just related, every\none was to some extent right and to some extent agreed. \n \nThat religious teaching was due to an immortal spirit--some\nnotion and evidence of the Divine and the Great Hereafter to be\nconveyed to it--scarce was disputed.  Nor was there collision\nover the necessity of what is called intellectual cultivation. \nThe boy must be taught something of the world in which he was to\nlive; nay, this latter knowledge seemed to be most immediately\npractical.  As each disputant fixed his eye on one or the other\naim that end appeared to him to be the most important.  Hence, by\na natural lapse, they came to treat subjects as antagonistic\nwhich were, in fact, parallel and quite consistent.  The one\ncalled the others godless--the others threw back the aspersion of\nbigotry.  Then came complication.  What was \"religion?\" \nIntellectual culture they could agree about--it embraced\nwell-known areas; but this religion divided itself into many\ndisputable fields.  These brother Protestants were like country\nneighbors who must encounter each other at fairs, markets, meets,\nand balls, and smile and greet, though each, at heart, is looking\nsavagely at the other's landmarks, and most are very likely\nfighting bitter lawsuits all the while.  It was because religion\nmeant CREED to most members of the committee, and because it so\nimplies to the vast bodies they represented, that they could not\ncome to terms about Ginx's Baby or any other infantile immortal. \nNot always, perhaps, but often, they fought for futile\ndistinctions.  Had Mahomet's creed consisted of but one article,\nThere is one God, the blood of many nations might never have\ngiven testimony against the creed they resented when to it he\ntacked and Mahomet is His prophet.  Could Protestants but consent\nto agree in their agreement and peacefully differ in their petty\ndifferences, how would the aggregated impulse of a simple faith\nroll down before it all the impediments of error! \n \nWhen Ginx's Baby had grown to a discretionary age, and was at all\nable to know truth from error--supposing that to be\nknowable--there were in the country fifty thousand reverend\ngentlemen of every tincture of religious opinion who might ply\nhim with their various theories, yet few of these would be\ncontented unless they could seize him while his young nature was\nplastic, and try to imprint on immortal clay the trade-mark of\nsome human invention. \n \n  \nXII.--No Funds--no Faith, no Works. \n \nThe Committee of the Protestant Detectoral Union on Ginx's Baby\nheld twenty-three meetings.  They were then as far from unity of\npurpose as when they set out.  Variety was given to the meetings\nby the changing combinations of members in attendance.  The\nfinances were little heeded in the intensity of their zeal for\ntruth.  These at length fell altogether into the hands of the\nassociation's secretary, and we have seen involved large items of\nexpense.  The twenty-three meetings extended over a year.  At the\nend of that time the secretary startled the committee by laying\non the table a demand for the board and keep of the Protestant\nbaby for three months, amounting to L 36; and adding that the sum\nin hand was L 1, 4s. 4 1/2d.  In his report he said: \"No effort\nhas been spared by means of advertisements, pamphlets, tales,\nleaders and paragraphs in newspapers and religious journals,\ntogether with occasional sermons, to maintain the public interest\nin this child; but attention has been diverted from him by the\ngreat Roman Spozzi case, and the anxiety created throughout the\nProtestant world by the recent discovery made by Dr. Gooddee, of\na solitary survivor of the ancient Church of the Vieuxbois\nProtestants in a secluded valley of the Pyrenees.\" \n \nThe secretary asked the committee to provide the money to\ndischarge the baby's liabilities; but they instantly adjourned,\nand no effort could afterwards get a quorum together.  When the\npersons who had charge of the Protestant foundling discovered the\nstate of affairs they began to dun the secretary and to neglect\nthe child, now about thirteen months old and preparing to walk. \nSince no money appeared they sold whatever clothes had been\nprovided for him, and absconded from the place where they had\nbeen farming him for Protestantism.  The secretary, by chance\nhearing of this, was discreet enough to make no inquiries. \nGinx's Baby, \"as a Protestant question,\" vanished from the world. \nI never heard that any one was asked what had been done with the\nfunds; but I have already furnished the account that ought to\nhave been rendered. \n \n \n \nXIII.--In transitu. \n \nOne night, near twelve o'clock, a shrewd tradesman, looking out\nof his shopdoor before he turned into bed, heard a cry which\nproceeded from a bundle on the pavement.  This he discovered to\nbe an infant wrapt in a potato-sack.  He was quick enough to\nobserve that it had been deftly laid over a line chiselled across\nthe pavement to the corner of his house, which line he knew to be\nthe boundary between his own parish of St. Simon Magus and the\nadjacent parish of St. Bartimeus.  He took note, being a business\nman, of the exact position of the child's body in relation to\nthis line, and then conveyed it to the workhouse of the other\nparish. \n \n \n \nPART III. \n \nWHAT THE PARISH DID WITH HIM. \n \nI.--Parochial Knots--to be untied without prejudice. \n \nThe infant borne to the workhouse of St. Bartimeus was Ginx's\nBaby.  When he had been placed on the floor of the matron's room,\nand examined by the master, that official turned to the unwelcome\nbearer of the burden. \n \n\"Did you find this child?\" \n \n\"Yes.\" \n \n\"Where?\" \n \n\"Lying opposite my shop in Nether Place.\" \n \n\"What's your name? \" \n \n\"Doll.\" \n \n\"Oh! you're the cheesemonger.  Your shop's on the other side of\nthe boundary, in the other parish.  The child ought not to come\nhere; it doesn't belong to us.\" \n \n\"Yes it does: it wasn't on my side of the line.\" \n \n\"But it was in front of your house?\" \n \n\"Well, the line runs crossways: it don't follow the child was in\nour parish.\" \n \n\"Oh, nonsense! there's no doubt about it!  We can't take the\nchild in.  You must carry it away again.\" \n \nMr. Snigger turned to leave the room. \n \n\"Wait a bit, sir,\" said Mr. Doll; \"I shall leave the child here,\nand you can do as you like with it.  It ain't mine, at all\nevents.  I say it lay in your parish; and if you don't look after\nit you may be the worse of it.  The coroner's sure to try to earn\nhis fees.  Good-night.\" \n \nHe hurried from the room. \n \n\"Stop!\" shouted the master, \"I say: I don't accept the child. \nYou leave it here at your own risk.  We keep it without\nprejudice, remember-- without prejudice, sir!--without----\" \n \nMr. Doll was in the street and out of hearing. \n \n \n \nII.--A Board of Guardians. \n \nThe Guardians of St. Bartimeus met the day after Mr. Doll's\nclever stratagem.  Among other business was a report from the\nmaster of the workhouse that a child, name unknown, found by Mr.\nDoll, cheesemonger, of Nether Place, in the Parish of St. Simon\nMagus, opposite his shop, and, as he alleged, on the nearer side\nof the parish boundary, had been left at the workhouse, and was\nnow in the custody of the matron.  The Guardians were not\naccustomed to restrain themselves, and did not withhold the\nexpression of their indignation upon this announcement.  As Mr.\nDoll had himself been a guardian of St. Simon Magus, it was clear\nto their impartial minds that he was trying by a trick to foist a\nbastard--perhaps his own--on the wrong parish. \n \nMr. Cheekey, a licensed victualler, moved that the master's\nreport be put under the table. \n \nMr. Slinkum, draper, seconded the motion. \n \nMr. Edge, ironmonger, pointed out that there was no parliamentary\nprecedent for such a disposition of the report, and, further,\nthat such action did not dispose of the baby. \n \n\"Well,\" said Mr. Cheekey, turning painfully red, \"no matter how\nye put it, I move to get rid of the brat.  What's the best form\nof motion?\"  \n \nA churchwarden, who happened to be a gentleman, explained that\nthe Board could not dismiss the question in so summary a way. \n\"He could foresee that there might be a nice point of law in the\ncase. They would have to take some legal means of ascertaining\ntheir liabilities, and of forcing the other parish to take the\nchild if they ought to do so.  They must consult their\nsolicitor.\"  This gentleman was sent for post haste.  Meanwhile\nthe baby was ordered to be brought in for inspection.  The matron\nhad handed him over to a sort of half-witted inmate of the house,\nwhose wits, however, were strangely about him at the wrong time,\nto nurse and amuse him.  This person brought Ginx's Baby into the\nBoard-room, and placed him on the table.  The Board of Guardians\ntook a good look at him.  He was not then in fair condition.  He\nwas limp, he was dirty, hollow in the cheeks, white, stiff in his\nlimbs, and half-naked-- (to be regardless of gender)-- \n \n     \"Pallidula, rigida, nudula.\" \n \n \n\"Hum!\" said Mr. Stink, who was a dog-breeder--\"What's his\npedigree?\" \n \nThis brutal joke was well received by some of the Guardians. \n \n\"His pedigree,\" answered the half-wit, gravely, \"goes back for\nthree hundred years.  Parients unknown by name, but got by Misery\nout o' Starvashun.  The line began with Poverty out o' Laziness\nin Queen Elizabeth's time.  The breed has been a large 'un\nwotever you thinks of the quality.\" \n \nThis pleasantry was less acceptable to the Board.  \n \n\"Well,\" said Mr. Scoop, grocer, a great stickler for\nparliamentary modes of procedure, \"I move it be committed. \" \n \n\"Committed!  Where?\" said Mr. Stink. \n \n\"To Newgate I s'pose,\" said the half-wit, his eyes twinkling. \n \n\"Nonsense, sir,--for consideration.  Send that man out,\"\nexclaimed Scoop--\"clear the room for consultation.\" \n \nDavus was expelled, and the baby was then formally consigned to\nthe care of a committee.  By this time the legal adviser came in.\nThe facts having been stated to him, he said: \n \n\"Gentlemen, as at present advised I am of opinion that the parish\nin which the child was found is bound to maintain him.  If Mr.\nDoll (a highly respectable person, my own cheesemonger) found the\nchild beyond the boundaries of St. Simon Magus--and he will of\ncourse swear that he did--you cannot refuse to take it in. \nHowever, I had better ascertain the facts from Mr. Doll and take\nthe opinion of counsel.  Meanwhile we must beware not to\ncompromise ourselves by admitting anything, or doing anything\nequivalent to an admission.  Let me see--Ah!--yes--a notice to be\nserved on the other parish repudiating the infant; another notice\nto Mr. Doll to take it away, and that it remains here at his risk\nand expense--you see, gentlemen, we could hardly venture to\nreturn it to Mr. Doll; we should create an unhappy impression \nin the minds of the public--\" \n \n\"D--n the public!\" said Mr. Stink. \n \n\"Quite so, my dear sir,\" said Mr. Phillpotts, smiling, \"quite so,\nbut that is not a legal or in fact practicable mode of discarding\nthem; we must act with public opinion, I fear.  Then, to resume,\nthirdly and to be strictly safe, we must serve a notice on the\ninfant and all whom it may concern.  I think I'll draft it at\nonce.\" \n \nIn a few minutes the committee in charge pinned to the only\ngarment of Ginx's Baby a paper in the following form:-- \n \n \nPARISH OF ST. BARTIMEUS. \n \nTo ---- ---- (name unknown), a Foundling, and all other persons\ninterested in the said Foundling. \n \nTAKE NOTICE \n \nThat you, or either of you, have no just or lawful claim to have\nyou or the said infant chargeable on the said Parish.  And this\nis to notify that you, the said infant, are retained in the\nworkhouse of the said Parish under protest, and that whatsoever\nis or may be done or provided for you is at the proper charge of\nyou, and all such persons as are and were by law bound to\nmaintain and keep the same. \n \n           WINKLE & PHILLPOTTS, \n             Solicitors for the Board. \n \n  \nIII.--\"The World is my Parish.\" \n \nWhen Mr. Phillpotts called upon Doll, the cheesemonger, the\nlatter straightway gave him the facts as they had occurred.  He\npointed out the exact spot on which the bundle had lain; he gave\nan estimate of the number of inches on each side of the line\noccupied by it, and declared that the head and shoulders of the\ninfant lay in the parish of the solicitor's clients.  Ginx's\nBaby, under the title \"Re a Foundling,\" was once more submitted\nfor the opinion of counsel.  They advised the Board that as the\nchild was in both parishes when found, but had been taken up by a\nratepayer of St. Simon Magus, the latter parish was bound to\nsupport him.  Whereupon the Guardians of St. Bartimeus at their\nnext meeting resolved that the Vestry of the other parish should\nhave a written notice to remove the child, failing which\napplication should be made to the Queen's Bench for a mandamus to\ncompel them to do it. \n \nOn receiving the challenge the Guardians of St. Simon Magus also\ntook counsel's opinion.  They were advised that as the greater\npart, and especially the head of the infant, was when discovered\nin the parish of St. Bartimeus, the latter was clearly\nchargeable.  Both parties then proceeded to swear affidavits. \nThe Attorney-General and Solicitor-General, the two great\nlaw-officers of the crown, were retained on opposite sides, and\ntook fees--not for an Imperial prosecution, but as petty Queen's\nCounsel in an inter-parochial squabble. \n \n  \nIV.--Without prejudice to any one but the Guardians. \n \nThe Court of Queen's Bench, after hearing an elaborate statement\nfrom the Attorney-General, granted a rule nisi for a mandamus.  \nThis rule was entered for argument in a paper called \"The Special\nPaper,\" and, the list being a heavy one, nearly a year elapsed\nbefore it was reached.  It was then again postponed several times\n\"for the convenience of counsel.\" \n \nThe Board of St. Bartimeus chafed under the law's delay.  They\nbecame morbidly sensitive to the incubus of Ginx's Baby,\nespecially as the press had been reviewing some of their recent\nacts with great bitterness."}

{"ID": 1356, "text": "Dr. James Ward, in his _Naturalism and Agnosticism_, makes this\na ground of complaint against physics: the business of those who wish to ascertain the ultimate\ntruth about the world, he apparently thinks, should be the discovery of causes, yet physics\nnever even seeks them. To me it seems that philosophy ought not to assume such legislative\nfunctions, and that the reason why physics has ceased to look for causes is that, in fact,\nthere are no such things. The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among\nphilosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is\nerroneously supposed to do no harm. In order to find out what philosophers commonly understand\nby \"cause,\" I consulted Baldwin's _Dictionary_, and was rewarded beyond my expectations, for\nI found the following three mutually incompatible definitions:--\n\n  \"CAUSALITY. (1) The necessary connection of events in the\n     time-series....\n\n  \"CAUSE (notion of). Whatever may be included in the thought or\n     perception of a process as taking place in consequence of\n     another process....\n\n  \"CAUSE AND EFFECT. (1) Cause and effect ... are correlative terms\n     denoting any two distinguishable things, phases, or aspects of\n     reality, which are so related to each other that whenever the\n     first ceases to exist the second comes into existence\n     immediately after, and whenever the second comes into existence\n     the first has ceased to exist immediately before.\"\n\nLet us consider these three definitions in turn. The first, obviously, is unintelligible without\na definition of \"necessary.\" Under this head, Baldwin's _Dictionary_ gives the following:--\n\n  \"NECESSARY. That is necessary which not only is true, but would\n     be true under all circumstances. Something more than brute\n     compulsion is, therefore, involved in the conception; there is\n     a general law under which the thing takes place.\"\n\nThe notion of cause is so intimately connected with that of necessity that it will be no digression\nto linger over the above definition, with a view to discovering, if possible, _some_ meaning\nof which it is capable; for, as it stands, it is very far from having any definite signification.\n\nThe first point to notice is that, if any meaning is to be given to the phrase \"would be true\nunder all circumstances,\" the subject of it must be a propositional function, not a proposition.[35]\nA proposition is simply true or false, and that ends the matter: there can be no question of\n\"circumstances.\" \"Charles I's head was cut off\" is just as true in summer as in winter, on\nSundays as on Mondays."}

{"ID": 1554, "text": "\nOne night, when she was at the worst, her poor mother, who had sat for\nmany a melancholy hour listening, by her bedside, to those plaintive\nincoherences of delirium and moanings of fever, which have harrowed so\nmany a fond heart, gained gradually from her very despair the courage\nwhich she had so long wanted, and knelt down at the side of her sick\ndarling's bed to pray for her deliverance.\n\nWith clasped hands, in an agony of supplication, she prayed that God\nwould, in his mercy, spare her little child--that, justly as she herself\ndeserved the sorest chastisement his hand could inflict, he would yet\ndeal patiently and tenderly with her in this one thing. She poured out\nher sorrows before the mercy-seat--she opened her heart, and declared her\nonly hope to be in his pity; without which, she felt that her darling\nwould only leave the bed where she was lying for her grave.\n\nExactly as she came to this part of her supplication, the child, who had\ngrown, as it seemed, more and more restless, and moaned and muttered with\nincreasing pain and irritation, on a sudden started upright in her bed,\nand, in a thrilling voice, cried--\n\n\"No! no!--the baby first.\"\n\nThe mysterious sentence which had secretly tormented her for so long,\nthus piercingly uttered by this delirious, and, perhaps, dying child,\nwith what seemed a preternatural earnestness and strength, arrested her\ndevotions, and froze her with a feeling akin to terror.\n\n\"Hush, hush, my darling!\" said the poor mother, almost wildly, as she\nclasped the attenuated frame of the sick child in her arms; \"hush, my\ndarling; don't cry out so loudly--there--there--my own love.\"\n\nThe child did not appear to see or hear her, but sate up still with\nfeverish cheeks, and bright unsteady eyes, while her dry lips were\nmuttering inaudible words.\n\n\"Lie down, my sweet child--lie down, for your own mother,\" she said;\n\"if you tire yourself, you can't grow well, and your poor mother will\nlose you.\"\n\nAt these words, the child suddenly cried out again, in precisely the same\nloud, strong voice--\"No! no! the baby first, the baby first\"--and\nimmediately afterwards lay down, and fell, for the first time since her\nillness into a tranquil sleep.\n\nMy good little wife sate, crying bitterly by her bedside. The child was\nbetter--_that_ was, indeed, delightful. But then there was an omen in the\nwords, thus echoed from her dream, which she dared not trust herself to\ninterpret, and which yet had seized, with a grasp of iron, upon every\nfibre of her brain.\n\n\"Oh, Richard,\" she cried, as she threw her arms about my neck, \"I am\nterrified at this horrible menace from the unseen world. Oh! poor,\ndarling little baby, I shall lose you--I am sure I shall lose you.\nComfort me, darling, and say he is not to die.\"\n\nAnd so I did; and tasked all my powers of argument and persuasion to\nconvince her how unsubstantial was the ground of her anxiety. The little\nboy was perfectly well, and, even were he to die before his sister that\nevent might not occur for seventy years to come. I could not, however,\nconceal from myself that there was something odd and unpleasant in the\ncoincidence; and my poor wife had grown so nervous and excitable, that a\nmuch less ominous conjecture would have sufficed to alarm her.\n\nMeanwhile, the unaccountable terror which our lodger's presence inspired\ncontinued to increase. One of our maids gave us warning, solely from her\ndread of our queer inmate, and the strange accessories which haunted him.\nShe said--and this was corroborated by her fellow-servant--that Mr. Smith\nseemed to have constantly a companion in his room; that although they\nnever heard them speak, they continually and distinctly heard the tread\nof two persons walking up and down the room together, and described\naccurately the peculiar sound of a stick or crutch tapping upon the\nfloor, which my own ears had heard. They also had seen the large,\nill-conditioned cat I have mentioned, frequently steal in and out of the\nstranger's room; and observed that when our little girl was in greatest\ndanger, the hateful animal was constantly writhing, fawning, and crawling\nabout the door of the sick room after nightfall. They were thoroughly\npersuaded that this ill-omened beast was the foul fiend himself, and I\nconfess I could not--sceptic as I was--bring myself absolutely to the\nbelief that he was nothing more than a \"harmless, necessary cat.\" These\nand similar reports--implicitly believed as they palpably were by those\nwho made them--were certainly little calculated to allay the perturbation\nand alarm with which our household was filled.\n\nThe evenings had by this time shortened very much, and darkness often\novertook us before we sate down to our early tea. It happened just at\nthis period of which I have been speaking, after my little girl had begun\ndecidedly to mend, that I was sitting in our dining-parlour, with my\nlittle boy fast asleep upon my knees, and thinking of I know not what, my\nwife having gone up stairs, as usual, to sit in the room with little\nFanny. As I thus sate in what was to me, in effect, total solitude,\ndarkness unperceived stole on us.\n\nOn a sudden, as I sate, with my elbow leaning upon the table, and my\nother arm round the sleeping child, I felt, as I thought, a cold\ncurrent of air faintly blowing upon my forehead. I raised my head, and\nsaw, as nearly as I could calculate, at the far end of the table on\nwhich my arm rested, two large green eyes confronting me. I could see\nno more, but instantly concluded they were those of the abominable cat.\nYielding to an impulse of horror and abhorrence, I caught a water-croft\nthat was close to my hand, and threw it full at it with all my force. I\nmust have missed my object, for the shining eyes continued fixed for a\nsecond, and then glided still nearer to me, and then a little nearer\nstill. The noise of the glass smashed with so much force upon the table\ncalled in the servant, who happened to be passing. She had a candle in\nher hand, and, perhaps, the light alarmed the odious beast, for as she\ncame in it was gone.\n\nI had had an undefined idea that its approach was somehow connected with\na designed injury of some sort to the sleeping child. I could not be\nmistaken as to the fact that I had plainly seen the two broad, glaring,\ngreen eyes. Where the cursed animal had gone I had not observed: it\nmight, indeed, easily have run out at the door as the servant opened it,\nbut neither of us had seen it do so; and we were every one of us in such\na state of nervous excitement, that even this incident was something in\nthe catalogue of our ambiguous experiences.\n\nIt was a great happiness to see our darling little Fanny every day\nmending, and now quite out of danger: this was cheering and delightful.\nIt was also something to know that more than two months of our lodger's\nterm of occupation had already expired; and to realise, as we now could\ndo, by anticipation, the unspeakable relief of his departure.\n\nMy wife strove hard to turn our dear child's recovery to good account for\nme; but the impressions of fear soon depart, and those of religious\ngratitude must be preceded by religious faith. All as yet was but as seed\nstrewn upon the rock.\n\nLittle Fanny, though recovering rapidly, was still very weak, and her\nmother usually passed a considerable part of every evening in her\nbedroom--for the child was sometimes uneasy and restless at night. It\nhappened at this period that, sitting as usual at Fanny's bedside, she\nwitnessed an occurrence which agitated her not a little.\n\nThe child had been, as it seems, growing sleepy, and was lying\nlistlessly, with eyes half open, apparently taking no note of what was\npassing. Suddenly, however, with an expression of the wildest terror, she\ndrew up her limbs, and cowered in the bed's head, gazing at some object;\nwhich, judging from the motion of her eyes, must have been slowly\nadvancing from the end of the room next the door.\n\nThe child made a low shuddering cry, as she grasped her mother's hand,\nand, with features white and tense with terror, slowly following with her\neyes the noiseless course of some unseen spectre, shrinking more and more\nfearfully backward every moment.\n\n\"What is it? Where? What is it that frightens you, my darling?\" asked the\npoor mother, who, thrilled with horror, looked in vain for the apparition\nwhich seemed to have all but bereft the child of reason.\n\n\"Stay with me--save me--keep it away--look, look at it--making signs to\nme--don't let it hurt me--it is angry--Oh! mamma, save me, save me!\"\n\nThe child said this, all the time clinging to her with both her hands, in\nan ecstasy of panic.\n\n\"There--there, my darling,\" said my poor wife, \"don't be afraid; there's\nnothing but me--your own mamma--and little baby in the room; nothing, my\ndarling; nothing indeed.\"\n\n\"Mamma, mamma, don't move; don't go near him\"; the child continued\nwildly. \"It's only his back now; don't make him turn again; he's untying\nhis handkerchief. Oh! baby, baby; he'll _kill_ baby! and he's lifting up\nthose green things from his eyes; don't you see him doing it? Mamma,\nmamma, why does he come here? Oh, mamma, poor baby--poor little baby!\"\n\nShe was looking with a terrified gaze at the little boy's bed, which lay\ndirectly opposite to her own, and in which he was sleeping calmly.\n\n\"Hush, hush, my darling child,\" said my wife, with difficulty\nrestraining an hysterical burst of tears; \"for God's sake don't speak so\nwildly, my own precious love--there, there--don't be frightened--there,\ndarling, there.\"\n\n\"Oh! poor baby--poor little darling baby,\" the child continued as before;\n\"will no one save him--tell that wicked man to go away--oh--there--why,\nmamma--don't--oh, sure you won't let him--don't--don't--he'll take the\nchild's life--will you let him lie down that way on the bed--save poor\nlittle baby--oh, baby, baby, waken--his head is on your face.\"\n\nAs she said this she raised her voice to a cry of despairing terror which\nmade the whole room ring again.\n\nThis cry, or rather yell, reached my ears as I sate reading in the\nparlour by myself, and fearing I knew not what, I rushed to the\napartment; before I reached it, the sound had subsided into low but\nviolent sobbing; and, just as I arrived at the threshold I heard, close\nat my feet, a fierce protracted growl, and something rubbing along the\nsurbase. I was in the dark, but, with a feeling of mingled terror and\nfury, I stamped and struck at the abhorred brute with my feet, but in\nvain. The next moment I was in the room, and heard little Fanny, through\nher sobs, cry--\n\n\"Oh, poor baby is killed--that wicked man has killed him--he uncovered\nhis face, and put it on him, and lay upon the bed and killed poor baby. I\nknew he came to kill him. Ah, papa, papa, why did you not come up before\nhe went?--he is gone, he went away as soon as he killed our poor little\ndarling baby.\"\n\nI could not conceal my agitation, quite, and I said to my wife--\n\n\"Has he, Smith, been here?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"The child has seen _some_ one.\"\n\n\"Seen whom? Who? Who has been here?\"\n\n\"I did not see it; but--but I am sure the child saw--that is, _thought_\nshe saw _him_;--the person you have named. Oh, God, in mercy deliver us!\nWhat shall I do--what shall I do!\"\n\nThus saying, the dear little woman burst into tears, and crying, as if\nher heart would break, sobbed out an entreaty that I would look at baby;\nadding, that she herself had not courage to see whether her darling was\nsleeping or dead.\n\n\"Dead!\" I exclaimed. \"Tut, tut, my darling; you must not give way to such\nmorbid fancies--he is very well, I see him breathing;\" and so saying, I\nwent over to the bed where our little boy was lying. He was slumbering;\nthough it seemed to me very heavily, and his cheeks were flushed.\n\n\"Sleeping tranquilly, my darling--tranquilly, and deeply; and with a\nwarm colour in his cheeks,\" I said, rearranging the coverlet, and\nretiring to my wife, who sate almost breathless whilst I was looking at\nour little boy.\n\n\"Thank God--thank God,\" she said quietly; and she wept again; and rising,\ncame to his bedside.\n\n\"Yes, yes--alive; thank God; but it seems to me he is breathing very\nshort, and with difficulty, and he looks--_does_ he not look hot and\nfeverish? Yes, he _is_ very hot; feel his little hand--feel his neck;\nmerciful heaven! he is burning.\"\n\nIt was, indeed, very true, that his skin was unnaturally dry and hot; his\nlittle pulse, too, was going at a fearful rate.\n\n\"I do think,\" said I--resolved to conceal the extent of my own\napprehensions--\"I do think that he is just a _little_ feverish; but he\nhas often been much more so; and will, I dare say, in the morning, be\nperfectly well again. I dare say, but for little Fanny's _dream_, we\nshould not have observed it at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, my darling, my darling, my darling!\" sobbed the poor little woman,\nleaning over the bed, with her hands locked together, and looking the\nvery picture of despair. \"Oh, my darling, what has happened to you? I put\nyou into your bed, looking so well and beautiful, this evening, and here\nyou are, stricken with sickness, my own little love. Oh, you will\nnot--you cannot, leave your poor mother!\"\n\nIt was quite plain that she despaired of the child from the moment we had\nascertained that it was unwell. As it happened, her presentiment was but\ntoo truly prophetic. The apothecary said the child's ailment was\n\"suppressed small-pox\"; the physician pronounced it \"typhus.\" The only\ncertainty about it was the issue--the child died.\n\nTo me few things appear so beautiful as a very young child in its\nshroud. The little innocent face looks so sublimely simple and confiding\namongst the cold terrors of death--crimeless, and fearless, that little\nmortal has passed alone under the shadow, and explored the mystery of\ndissolution. There is death in its sublimest and purest image--no\nhatred, no hypocrisy, no suspicion, no care for the morrow ever darkened\nthat little face; death has come lovingly upon it; there is nothing\ncruel, or harsh, in his victory. The yearnings of love, indeed, cannot\nbe stifled; for the prattle, and smiles, and all the little world of\nthoughts that were so delightful, are gone for ever. Awe, too, will\novercast us in its presence--for we are looking on death; but we do not\nfear for the little, lonely voyager--for the child has gone, simple and\ntrusting, into the presence of its all-wise Father; and of such, we\nknow, is the kingdom of heaven.\n\nAnd so we parted from poor little baby. I and his poor old nurse\ndrove in a mourning carriage, in which lay the little coffin, early\nin the morning, to the churchyard of ----. Sore, indeed, was my\nheart, as I followed that little coffin to the grave! Another burial\nhad just concluded as we entered the churchyard, and the mourners\nstood in clusters round the grave, into which the sexton was now\nshovelling the mould.\n\nAs I stood, with head uncovered, listening to the sublime and touching\nservice which our ritual prescribes, I found that a gentleman had drawn\nnear also, and was standing at my elbow. I did not turn to look at him\nuntil the earth had closed over my darling boy; I then walked a little\nway apart, that I might be alone, and drying my eyes, sat down upon a\ntombstone, to let the confusion of my mind subside.\n\nWhile I was thus lost in a sorrowful reverie, the gentleman who had stood\nnear me at the grave was once more at my side. The face of the stranger,\nthough I could not call it handsome, was very remarkable; its expression\nwas the purest and noblest I could conceive, and it was made very\nbeautiful by a look of such compassion as I never saw before.\n\n\"Why do you sorrow as one without hope?\" he said, gently.\n\n\"I _have_ no hope,\" I answered.\n\n\"Nay, I think you have,\" he answered again; \"and I am sure you will soon\nhave more. That little child for which you grieve, has escaped the\ndangers and miseries of life; its body has perished; but he will receive\nin the end the crown of life. God has given him an early victory.\"\n\nI know not what it was in him that rebuked my sullen pride, and humbled\nand saddened me, as I listened to this man. He was dressed in deep\nmourning, and looked more serene, noble, and sweet than any I had ever\nseen. He was young, too, as I have said, and his voice very clear and\nharmonious. He talked to me for a long time, and I listened to him with\ninvoluntary reverence. At last, however, he left me, saying he had often\nseen me walking into town, about the same hour that he used to go that\nway, and that if he saw me again he would walk with me, and so we might\nreason of these things together.\n\nIt was late when I returned to my home, now a house of mourning.\n\n\nPART II\n\n\nOur home was one of sorrow and of fear. The child's death had stricken us\nwith terror no less than grief. Referring it, as we both tacitly did, to\nthe mysterious and fiendish agency of the abhorred being whom, in an evil\nhour, we had admitted into our house, we both viewed him with a degree\nand species of fear for which I can find no name.\n\nI felt that some further calamity was impending. I could not hope that we\nwere to be delivered from the presence of the malignant agent who\nhaunted, rather than inhabited our home, without some additional proofs\nalike of his malice and his power.\n\nMy poor wife's presentiments were still more terrible and overpowering,\nthough not more defined, than my own. She was never tranquil while our\nlittle girl was out of her sight; always dreading and expecting some new\nrevelation of the evil influence which, as we were indeed both persuaded,\nhad bereft our darling little boy of life. Against an hostility so\nunearthly and intangible there was no guarding, and the sense of\nhelplessness intensified the misery of our situation. Tormented with\ndoubts of the very basis of her religion, and recoiling from the ordeal\nof prayer with the strange horror with which the victim of hydrophobia\nrepels the pure water, she no longer found the consolation which, had\nsorrow reached her in any other shape, she would have drawn from the\nhealing influence of religion. We were both of us unhappy, dismayed,\nDEMON-STRICKEN.\n\nMeanwhile, our lodger's habits continued precisely the same. If, indeed,\nthe sounds which came from his apartments were to be trusted, he and his\nagents were more on the alert than ever. I can convey to you, good\nreader, no notion, even the faintest, of the dreadful sensation always\nmore or less present to my mind, and sometimes with a reality which\nthrilled me almost to frenzy--the apprehension that I had admitted into\nmy house the incarnate spirit of the dead or damned, to torment me and\nmy family.\n\nIt was some nights after the burial of our dear little baby; we had not\ngone to bed until late, and I had slept, I suppose, some hours, when I\nwas awakened by my wife, who clung to me with the energy of terror. She\nsaid nothing, but grasped and shook me with more than her natural\nstrength. She had crept close to me, and was cowering with her head under\nthe bedclothes.\n\nThe room was perfectly dark, as usual, for we burned no night-light; but\nfrom the side of the bed next her proceeded a voice as of one sitting\nthere with his head within a foot of the curtains--and, merciful heavens!\nit was the voice of our lodger.\n\nHe was discoursing of the death of our baby, and inveighing, in the old\nmocking tone of hate and suppressed fury, against the justice, mercy, and\ngoodness of God. He did this with a terrible plausibility of sophistry,\nand with a resolute emphasis and precision, which seemed to imply, \"I\nhave got something to tell you, and, whether you like it or like it not,\nI _will_ say out my say.\"\n\nTo pretend that I felt anger at his intrusion, or emotion of any sort,\nsave the one sense of palsied terror, would be to depart from the truth.\nI lay, cold and breathless, as if frozen to death--unable to move, unable\nto utter a cry--with the voice of that demon pouring, in the dark, his\nundisguised blasphemies and temptations close into my ears. At last the\ndreadful voice ceased--whether the speaker went or stayed I could not\ntell--the silence, which he might be improving for the purpose of some\nhellish strategem, was to me more tremendous even than his speech.\n\nWe both lay awake, not daring to move or speak, scarcely even breathing,\nbut clasping one another fast, until at length the welcome light of day\nstreamed into the room through the opening door, as the servant came in\nto call us. I need not say that our nocturnal visitant had left us.\n\nThe magnanimous reader will, perhaps, pronounce that I ought to have\npulled on my boots and inexpressibles with all available despatch, run to\nmy lodger's bedroom, and kicked him forthwith downstairs, and the entire\nway moreover out to the public road, as some compensation for the\nscandalous affront put upon me and my wife by his impertinent visit. Now,\nat that time, I had no scruples against what are termed the laws of\nhonour, was by no means deficient in \"pluck,\" and gifted, moreover, with\na somewhat excitable temper. Yet, I will honestly avow that, so far from\ncourting a collision with the dreaded stranger, I would have recoiled at\nhis very sight, and given my eyes to avoid him, such was the ascendancy\nwhich he had acquired over me, as well as everybody else in my household,\nin his own quiet, irresistible, hellish way.\n\nThe shuddering antipathy which our guest inspired did not rob his\ninfernal homily of its effect. It was not a new or strange thing which\nhe presented to our minds. There was an awful subtlety in the train of\nhis suggestions. All that he had said had floated through my own mind\nbefore, without order, indeed, or shew of logic. From my own rebellious\nheart the same evil thoughts had risen, like pale apparitions hovering\nand lost in the fumes of a necromancer's cauldron. His was like the\nsumming up of all this--a reflection of my own feelings and fancies--but\nreduced to an awful order and definiteness, and clothed with a\nsophistical form of argument. The effect of it was powerful. It revived\nand exaggerated these bad emotions--it methodised and justified\nthem--and gave to impulses and impressions, vague and desultory before,\nsomething of the compactness of a system.\n\nMy misfortune, therefore, did not soften, it exasperated me. I regarded\nthe Great Disposer of events as a persecutor of the human race, who took\ndelight in their miseries. I asked why my innocent child had been smitten\ndown into the grave?--and why my darling wife, whose first object, I\nknew, had ever been to serve and glorify her Maker, should have been thus\ntortured and desolated by the cruelest calamity which the malignity of a\ndemon could have devised? I railed and blasphemed, and even in my agony\ndefied God with the impotent rage and desperation of a devil, in his\neverlasting torment.\n\nIn my bitterness, I could not forbear speaking these impenitent\nrepetitions of the language of our nightly visitant, even in the presence\nof my wife. She heard me with agony, almost with terror. I pitied and\nloved her too much not to respect even her weaknesses--for so I\ncharacterised her humble submission to the chastisements of heaven. But\neven while I spared her reverential sensitiveness, the spectacle of her\npatience but enhanced my own gloomy and impenitent rage.\n\nI was walking into town in this evil mood, when I was overtaken by the\ngentleman whom I had spoken with in the churchyard on the morning when my\nlittle boy was buried. I call him _gentleman_, but I could not say _what_\nwas his rank--I never thought about it; there was a grace, a purity, a\ncompassion, and a grandeur of intellect in his countenance, in his\nlanguage, in his mien, that was beautiful and kinglike. I felt, in his\ncompany, a delightful awe, and an humbleness more gratifying than any\nelation of earthly pride.\n\nHe divined my state of feeling, but he said nothing harsh. He did not\nrebuke, but he reasoned with me--and oh! how mighty was that\nreasoning--without formality--without effort--as the flower grows and\nblossoms."}
{"ID": 1717, "text": "\"The Arachne?\" asked the King.\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" cried Hermon ardently.  \"With its completion I expected to render the greatest\nservice, not only to myself, but to the cause of truth.\"\n\nHere Ptolemy interrupted with icy coldness: \"Yet you were certainly wrong; at least, if the\nThracian Althea, who is the personification of falsehood, had continued to be the model.\" \nThen he changed his tone, and with the exclamation: \"You are protected from the needs of life,\nunless your rich uncle throws his property into the most insatiable of gulfs. May Straton's\nphilosophy help you better to sustain your courage in the darkness which surrounds you than\nit has aided me to bear other trials!\" he left the room.\n\nThus ended the artist's conversation with the King, from which Hermon had expected such great\nresults and, deeply agitated, he ordered the driver of his horses to take him to Daphne.  She\nwas the only person to whom he could confide what disappointment this interview had caused him.\n\nOthers had previously reproached him, as the King had just done, with having, in the Demeter,\nbecome faithless to his artistic past.  How false and foolish this was!  Many a remark from\nthe critics would have been better suited to Myrtilus's work than to his.  Yet his fear in\nTennis had not been true.  Only Daphne's sweet face did not suit his more vigorous method of\nemphasizing distinctions.\n\nWhat a many-hued chameleon was the verdict upon works of plastic art! Once--on his return to\nthe capital--thousands had united in the same one, and now how widely they differed again!\n\nHis earlier works, which were now lauded to the skies, had formerly invited censure and vehement\nattacks.\n\nWhat would he not have given for the possibility of seeing his admired work once more!\n\nAs his way led past the Temple of Demeter, he stopped near it and was guided to the sanctuary.\n\nIt was filled with worshippers, and when, in his resolute manner, he told the curator and the\nofficiating priest that he wished to enter the cella, and asked for a ladder to feel the goddess,\nhe was most positively refused.\n\nWhat he requested seemed a profanation of the sacred image, and it would not do to disturb\nthe devout throng.  His desire to lower the pedestal could not be gratified.\n\nThe high priest who came forward upheld his subordinates and, after a short dispute, Hermon\nleft the sanctuary with his wish unfulfilled.\n\nNever had he so keenly lamented his lost vision as during the remainder of the drive, and when\nDaphne received him he described with passionate lamentation how terribly blindness embittered\nhis life, and declared himself ready to submit to the severest suffering to regain his sight.\n\nShe earnestly entreated him to apply to the great physician Erasistratus again, and Hermon\nwillingly consented.  He had promised to attend a banquet given that day by the wealthy ship-owner\nArchon.  The feast lasted until early morning, but toward noon Hermon again appeared in his\nuncle's house, and met Daphne full of joyous confidence, as if he were completely transformed.\n\nWhile at Archon's table he had determined to place his cure in the hands of higher powers.\nThis was the will of Fate; for the guest whose cushion he shared was Silanus, the host's son,\nand the first thing he learned from him was the news that he was going the next day, with several\nfriends, to the oracle of Amon in the Libyan Desert, to ask it what should be done for his\nmother, who had been for several years an invalid whom no physician could help.  He had heard\nfrom many quarters that the counsel of the god, who had greeted Alexander the Great as his\nson, was infallible.\n\nThen Hermon had been most urgently pressed by the young man to accompany him.  Every comfort\nwould be provided.  One of his father's fine ships would convey them to Paraetonium, where\ntents, saddle horses, and guides for the short land journey would be ready.\n\nSo he had promised to go with Silanus, and his decision was warmly approved by his uncle, Daphne,\nand the gray-haired Pelusinian couple. Perhaps the god would show the blind man the right path\nto recovery.  He would always be able to call the skill of the Alexandrian leeches to his aid.\n\nSoon after Hermon went on board Archon's splendidly equipped vessel and, instead of a tiresome\njourney, began a new and riotous period of festivity.\n\nLavish provision had been made for gay companions of both sexes, merry entertainment by means\nof dancing, music, and song, well filled dishes and mixing vessels, and life during the ride\nthrough the coast and desert regions was not less jovial and luxurious than on the ship.\n\nIt seemed to the blind man like one vast banquet in the dark, interrupted only by sleep.\n\nThe hope of counsel from the gods cheered the depressed mood which had weighed upon him for\nseveral weeks, and rich young Silanus praised the lucky fate which had enabled him to find\na travelling companion whose intellect and wit charmed him and the others, and often detained\nthem over the wine until late into the night.\n\nHere, too, Hermon felt himself the most distinguished person, the animating and attracting\npower, until it was said that the voyage was over, and the company pitched their tents in the\nfamous oasis near the Temple of Amon.\n\nThe musicians and dancers, with due regard to propriety, had been left behind in the seaport\nof Paraetonium.  Yet the young travellers were sufficiently gay while Silanus and Hermon waited\nfor admission to the place of the oracle.  A week after their arrival it was opened to them,\nyet the words repeated to them by the priest satisfied neither Hermon nor Archon's son, for\nthe oracle advised the latter to bring his mother herself to the oasis by the land road if\nshe earnestly desired recovery, while to Hermon was shouted the ambiguous saying:\n\n    \"Only night and darkness spring from the rank marsh of pleasure;\n     Morning and day rise brightly from the starving sand.\"\n\nCould Silanus's mother, who was unable to move, endure the desert journey?  And what was the\nmeaning of the sand, from which morning and day--which was probably the fresh enjoyment of\nthe light--were to rise for Hermon?  The sentence of the oracle weighed heavily upon him, as\nwell as on Archon's son, who loved his mother, and the homeward journey became to the blind\nman by no means a cheerful but rather a very troubled dream.\n\nThoughtful, very  disturbed, dissatisfied with himself, and resolved to turn his back upon\nthe dreary life of pleasure which for so long a time had allowed him no rest, and now disgusted\nhim, he kept aloof from his travelling companions, and rejoiced when, at Alexandria, he was\nled ashore in the harbour of Eunostus.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHermon entered his house with drooping head.\n\nHere he was informed that the grammateus of the Dionysian artists had already called twice\nto speak to him concerning an important matter. When he came from the bath, Proclus visited\nhim again.  His errand was to invite him to a banquet which was to take place that evening\nat his residence in a wing of the royal palace.\n\nBut Hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel, and he frankly said so, although immediately\nafter his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship\nof artists would give the following day in honour of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor\nEuphranor.  The grammateus alluded to this, and most positively insisted that he could not\nrelease him; for he came not only by his own wish, but in obedience to the command of Queen\nArsinoe, who desired to tell the creator of the Demeter how highly she esteemed his work and\nhis art.  She would appear herself at dessert, and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually\nearly hour.  He, Proclus, was to have the high honour of including the royal lady among his\nguests solely on Hermon's account, and his refusal would be an insult to the Queen.\n\nSo the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition.  He did this reluctantly;\nbut the Queen's attention to him and his art flattered his vanity and, if he was to abandon\nthe intoxicating and barren life of pleasure, it could scarcely be done more worthily than\nat a festival where the King's consort intended to distinguish him in person.\n\nThe banquet was to begin in a few hours, yet he could not let the day pass without seeing Daphne\nand telling her the words of the oracle.  He longed, with ardent yearning, for the sound of\nher voice, and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her.\n\nOh, if only his Myrtilus still walked among the living!  How totally different, in spite of\nhis lost vision, would his life have been!\n\nDaphne was now the only one whom he could put in his place.\n\nSince his return from the oracle, the fear that the rescued Demeter might yet be the work of\nMyrtilus had again mastered him.  However loudly outward circumstances might oppose this, he\nnow felt, with a certainty which surprised him, that this work was not his own.  The approval,\nas well as the doubts, which it aroused in others strengthened his opinion, although even now\nhe could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts.  How deep had been the intoxication\nin which he had so long reeled from one day to the next, since it had succeeded in keeping\nevery doubt of the authorship of this work far from him!\n\nNow he must obtain certainty, and Daphne could help him to it; for, as a priestess of Demeter,\nshe possessed the right to procure him access to the cella and get permission for him to climb\nthe lofty pedestal and feel the statue with his fingers, whose sense of touch had become much\nkeener.\n\nHe would frankly inform her of his fear, and her truthful nature would find the doubt that\ngnawed his heart as unendurable as he himself.\n\nIt would have been a grave crime to woo her before he was relieved of this uncertainty, and\nhe would utter the decisive words that very day, and ask her whether her love was great enough\nto share the joys and sorrows of life with him, the blind man, who perhaps must also divest\nhimself of a false fame.\n\nTime pressed.\n\nHe called at Archias's house with a wreath on his head and in festal robes; but Daphne was\nin the temple, whither old Philippus and Thyone had gone, and his uncle was attending a late\nsession of the Council.\n\nHe would have liked to follow Daphne to the sanctuary, but the late hour forbade it, and he\ntherefore only charged Gras to tell his young mistress that he was going to Proclus's banquet,\nand would return early the next morning to discuss a most important subject with her.\n\nThen he went directly to the neighbouring palace.  The Queen might have appeared already, and\nit would not do to keep her waiting.\n\nHe was aware that she lived at variance with her husband, but how could he have suspected that\nshe cherished the more than bold design of hurling the sovereign from his throne and seizing\nthe Egyptian crown herself.\n\nProclus and Althea were among the conspirators who supported Arsinoe, and the Queen thought\nit would be an easy matter to win over to her cause and herself the handsome sculptor, whom\nshe remembered at the last Dionysia.\n\nThe wealthy blind artist, so highly esteemed among the members of his profession, might become\nvaluable to the conspiracy, for she knew what enthusiastic devotion the Alexandrian artists\nfelt for the King, and everything depended upon forming a party in her own favour among them.\nThis task was to fall to Hermon, and also another, still more important one; for he, his nephew\nand future son-in-law, if any one, could persuade the wealthy Archias to lend the plot his\nvaluable aid.  Hitherto the merchant had been induced, it is true, to advance large sums of\nmoney to the Queen, but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered\nit impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy. Althea, however, declared that the\nblind man's marriage to Daphne was only a question of time, and Proclus added that the easily\nexcited nephew would show himself more pliant than the uncle if Arsinoe exerted upon him the\nirresistible charm of her personality.\n\nWhen Hermon entered the residence of the grammateus in the palace, the guests had already assembled.\nThe Queen was not to appear until after the feast, when the mixing jars were filled.  The place\nby Hermon's side, which Althea had chosen for herself, would then be given up to Arsinoe.\n\nThe sovereign was as unaccustomed to the society of a blind artist as Hermon was to that of\na queen, and both eagerly anticipated the approaching meeting.\n\nYet it was difficult for Hermon to turn a bright face toward his companion.  The sources of\nanxiety and grief which had previously burdened his mind would not vanish, even under the roof\nof the royal palace.\n\nAlthea's presence reminded him of Tennis, Ledscha, and Nemesis, who for so long a time seemed\nto have suspended her persecution, but since he had returned from the abode of the oracle was\nagain asserting the old right to him.  During many a sleepless hour of the night he had once\nmore heard the rolling of her terrible wheel.\n\nEven before the journey to the oasis of Amon, everything life could offer him, the idle rake,\nin his perpetual darkness, had seemed shallow and scarcely worth stretching out his hand for it.\n\nTrue, an interesting conversation still had power to charm him, but often during its continuance\nthe full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind; for the majority of the\nsubjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight, and referred to\nnew creations of architecture, sculpture, and painting, from whose enjoyment his blindness\ndebarred him.\n\nWhen returning home from a banquet, if his way lay through the city, he was reminded of the\nsuperb buildings, marble terraces and fountains, statues and porticoes, which had formerly\nsatiated his eyes with delight, and must now be illumined with a brilliant radiance by the\nmorning sunbeams, though a hostile fate shut them out from his eyes, starving and thirsting\nfor beautiful forms.\n\nBut it had seemed to him still harder to bear that his blinded eyes refused to show him the\nmost beautiful of all beautiful things, the human form, when he lingered among the Ephebi or\nthe spectators of a festal procession, or visited the gymnasium, the theatre, the Aphrodisium,\nor the Paneum gardens, where the beautiful women met at sunset.\n\nThe Queen was to appear immediately, and when she took her place near him his blindness would\nagain deprive him of the sight of her delicately cut features, prevent his returning the glances\nfrom her sparkling eves, and admiring the noble outlines of her thinly veiled figure.\n\nWould his troubled spirit at least permit him to enjoy and enter without restraint into the\nplay of her quick wit?\n\nPerhaps her arrival would relieve him from the discomfort which oppressed him here.\n\nA stranger, out of his own sphere, he felt chilled among these closely united men and women,\nto whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host.\n\nHe was not acquainted with a single individual except the mythograph Crates, who for several\nmonths had been one of the members of the Museum, and who had attached himself to Hermon at\nStraton's lectures.\n\nThe artist was surprised to find this man in such a circle, but he learned from Althea that\nthe young member of the Museum was a relative of Proclus, and a suitor of the beautiful Nico,\none of the Queen's ladies in waiting, who was among the guests.\n\nCrates had really been invited in order to win him over to the Queen's cause; but charming\nfair-haired Nico had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing Arsinoe's\npraises among his professional associates.\n\nThe rest of the men present stood in close connection with Arsinoe, and were fellow-conspirators\nagainst her husband's throne and life.  The ladies whom Proclus had invited were all confidants\nof Arsinoe, the wives and daughters of his other guests.  All were members of the highest class\nof society, and their manners showed the entire freedom from restraint that existed in the\nQueen's immediate circle.  Althea profited by the advantage of being Hermon's only acquaintance\nhere.  So, when he took his place on the cushion at her side, she greeted him familiarly and\ncordially, as she had treated him for a long time, wherever they met, and in a low voice told\nhim, sometimes in a kindly tone, sometimes with biting sarcasm, the names and characters of\nthe other guests.\n\nThe most aristocratic was Amyntas, who stood highest of all in the Queen's favour because he\nhad good reason to hate the other Arsinoe, the sister of the King.  His son had been this royal\ndame's first husband, and she had deserted him to marry Lysimachus, the aged King of Thrace.\n\nThe Rhodian Chrysippus, her leech and trusted counsellor, also possessed great influence over\nthe Queen.\n\n\"The noble lady,\" whispered Althea, \"needs the faithful devotion of every well-disposed subject,\nfor perhaps you have already learned how cruelly the King embitters the life of the mother\nof his three children.  Many a caprice can be forgiven the suffering Ptolemy, who recently\nexpressed a wish that he could change places with the common workmen whom he saw eating their\nmeal with a good appetite, and who is now tortured by the gout; yet he watches the hapless\nwoman with the jealousy of a tiger, though he himself is openly faithless to her.  What is\nthe Queen to him, since the widow of Lysimachus returned from Thrace--no, from Cassandrea,\nEphesus, and sacred Samothrace, or whatever other places there are which would no longer tolerate\nthe murderess?\"\n\n\"The King's sister--the object of his love?\" cried Hermon incredulously. \"She must be forty\nyears old now.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" Althea assented.  \"But we are in Egypt, where marriages between brothers and sisters\nare pleasing to gods and men; and besides, we make our own moral laws here.  Her age!  We women\nare only as old as we look, and the leeches and tiring women of this beauty of forty practise\narts which give her the appearance of twenty-five, yet perhaps the King values her intellect\nmore than her person, and the wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's\nhead.  She will make our poor Queen suffer unless real friends guard her from the worst.  The\nthree most trustworthy ones are here:  Amyntas, the leech Chrysippus, and the admirable Proclus.\nLet us hope that you will make this three-leaved clover the luck-promising four-leaved one.\nYour uncle, too, has often with praiseworthy generosity helped Arsinoe in many an embarrassment.\nOnly make the acquaintance of this beautiful royal lady, and the last drop of your blood will\nnot seem too precious to shed for her!  Besides-- Proclus told me so in confidence--you have\nlittle favour to expect from the King.  How long he kept you waiting for the first word concerning\na work which justly transported the whole city with delight!  When he did finally summon you,\nhe said things which must have wounded you.\"\n\n\"That is going too far,\" replied Hermon.\n\n\"Then he kept back his real opinion,\" Althea protested.  \"Had I not made it a rule to maintain\nabsolute silence concerning everything I hear in conversation from those with whom I am closely\nassociated--\"\n\nHere she was interrupted by Chrysippus, who asked if Althea had told her neighbour about his\nRhodian eye-salve.\n\nHe winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke, and then informed the blind artist\nhow graciously Arsinoe had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a\nwonderful cure of blind eyes had been made in Rhodes.  The royal lady had inquired about him\nand his sufferings with almost sisterly interest, and Althea eagerly confirmed the statement.\n\nHermon listened to the pair in silence.\n\nHe had not been able to see them, it is true, yet he had perceived their design as if the loss\nof sight had sharpened his mental vision.  He imagined that he could see the favourite and\nAlthea nudge each other with sneering gestures, and believed that their sole purpose was to\nrender him--he knew not for what object--the obedient tool of the Queen, who had probably also\nsucceeded in persuading his usually cautious uncle to render her great services.\n\nThe remembrance of Arsinoe's undignified conduct at the Dionysia, and the shameful stories\nof her which he had heard returned to his mind.  At the same time he saw Daphne rise before\nhim in her aristocratic dignity and kindly goodness, and a smile of satisfaction hovered around\nhis lips as he said to himself: \"The spider Althea again!  But, in spite of my blindness, I\nwill be caught neither in her net nor in the Queen's.  They are the last to bar the way which\nleads to Daphne and real happiness.\"\n\nThe Rhodian was just beginning to praise Arsinoe also as a special friend and connoisseur of\nthe sculptor's art when Crates, Hermon's fellow- student, asked the blind artist, in behalf\nof his beautiful companion, why his Demeter was placed upon a pedestal which, to others as\nwell as himself, seemed too high for the size of the statue.\n\nHermon replied that he had heard several make this criticism, but the priests of the goddess\nrefused to take it into account.\n\nHere he hesitated, for, like a blow from an invisible hand, the thought darted through his\nmind that perhaps, on the morrow, he would see himself compelled before the whole world to\ncast aside the crown of fame which he owed to the statue on the lofty pedestal.  He did not\nhave even the remotest idea of continuing to deck himself with false renown if his dread was\nrealized; yet he doubtless imagined how this whole aristocratic circle, with the Queen, Althea,\nand Proclus at its head, would turn with reckless haste from the hapless man who had led them\ninto such a shameful error.\n\nYet what mattered it, even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed\nthe finger of scorn at him?  Better people would thereby be robbed of the right to accuse him\nof faithlessness to himself.  This thought darted through his heated brain like a flash of\nlightning, and when, in spite of his silence, the conversation was continued and Althea told\nthe others that only Hermon's blindness had prevented the creation of a work which could have\nbeen confidently expected far to surpass the Demeter, since it seemed to have been exactly\nsuited to his special talent, he answered his beautiful companion's remark curtly and absently.\n\nShe perceived this with annoyance and perplexity.\n\nA woman who yearns for the regard of all men, and makes love a toy, easily lessens the demands\nshe imposes upon individuals.  Only, even though love has wholly disappeared, she still claims\nconsideration, and Althea did not wish to lose Hermon's regard.\n\nWhen Amyntas, the head of the conspirators, attracted the attention of the company by malicious\nremarks about the King's sister, the Thracian laid her hand on the blind artist's arm, whispering:\n\"Has the image of the Arachne which, at Tennis, charmed you even in the presence of the angry\nZeus, completely vanished from your memory?  How indifferent you look!  But I tell you\"--her\ndeep blue eyes flashed as she spoke--\"that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist\nthe case was different. Even while putting the last touches of the file to the Demeter, for\nwhich Archias's devout daughter posed as your model, another whom you could not banish from\nyour mind filled your imagination.  Though so loud a denial is written on your face, I persist\nin my conviction, and that no idle delusion ensnares me I can prove!\"\n\nHermon raised his sightless eyes to her inquiringly, but she went on with eager positiveness:\n\"Or, if you did not think of the weaver while carving the goddess, how did you happen to engrave\na spider on the ribbon twined around the ears of grain in Demeter's hand?  Not the smallest\ndetail of a work produced by the hand of a valued friend escapes my notice, and I perceived\nit before the Demeter came to the temple and the lofty pedestal.  Now I would scarcely be able\nto discover it in the dusky cella, yet at that time I took pleasure in the sight of the ugly\ninsect, not only because it is cleverly done, but because it reminded me of something\"--here\nshe lowered her voice still more--\"that pleased me, though probably it would seem less flattering\nto the daughter of Archias, who perhaps is better suited to act as guide to the blind."}

{"ID": 942, "text": "He was\nnot ashamed of the thing he had done;--but yet he was ashamed that it\nshould be discussed in public.\n\nWhy had he allowed himself to be put into a position in which he was\nsubject to such grievous annoyance? Since he had held his office he\nhad not had a happy day, nor,--so he told himself,--had he received\nfrom it any slightest gratification, nor could he buoy himself up\nwith the idea that he was doing good service for his country. After\na while he walked into the next room and showed the paper to Mr.\nWarburton. \"Perhaps you were right,\" he said, \"when you told me not\nto send that money.\"\n\n\"It will matter nothing,\" said the private Secretary when he had read\nit,--thinking, however, that it might matter much, but wishing to\nspare the Duke.\n\n\"I was obliged to repay the man as the Duchess had--had encouraged\nhim. The Duchess had not quite--quite understood my wishes.\" Mr.\nWarburton knew the whole history now, having discussed it all with\nthe Duchess more than once.\n\n\"I think your Grace should take no notice of the article.\"\n\nNo notice was taken of it, but three days afterwards there appeared a\nshort paragraph in large type,--beginning with a question. \"Does the\nDuke of Omnium intend to answer the question asked by us last Friday?\nIs it true that he paid the expenses of Mr. Lopez when that gentleman\nstood for Silverbridge? The Duke may be assured that the question\nshall be repeated till it is answered.\" This the Duke also saw and\ntook to his private Secretary.\n\n\"I would do nothing at any rate till it be noticed in some other\npaper,\" said the private Secretary. \"The 'People's Banner' is known\nto be scandalous.\"\n\n\"Of course it is scandalous. And, moreover, I know the motives and\nthe malice of the wretched man who is the editor. But the paper is\nread, and the foul charge if repeated will become known, and the\nallegation made is true. I did pay the man's election expenses;--and,\nmoreover, to tell the truth openly as I do not scruple to do to you,\nI am not prepared to state publicly the reason why I did so. And\nnothing but that reason could justify me.\"\n\n\"Then I think your Grace should state it.\"\n\n\"I cannot do so.\"\n\n\"The Duke of St. Bungay is here. Would it not be well to tell the\nwhole affair to him?\"\n\n\"I will think of it. I do not know why I should have troubled you.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord!\"\n\n\"Except that there is always some comfort in speaking even of one's\ntrouble. I will think about it. In the meantime you need perhaps not\nmention it again.\"\n\n\"Who? I? Oh, certainly not.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to others,--but to myself. I will turn it in my mind\nand speak of it when I have decided anything.\" And he did think about\nit,--thinking of it so much that he could hardly get the matter out\nof his mind day or night. To his wife he did not allude to it at\nall. Why trouble her with it? She had caused the evil, and he had\ncautioned her as to the future. She could not help him out of the\ndifficulty she had created. He continued to turn the matter over\nin his thoughts till he so magnified it, and built it up into such\nproportions, that he again began to think that he must resign. It\nwas, he thought, true that a man should not remain in office as Prime\nMinister who in such a matter could not clear his own conduct.\n\nThen there was a third attack in the \"People's Banner,\" and after\nthat the matter was noticed in the \"Evening Pulpit.\" This notice\nthe Duke of St. Bungay saw and mentioned to Mr. Warburton. \"Has the\nDuke spoken to you of some allegations made in the press as to the\nexpenses of the late election at Silverbridge?\" The old Duke was\nat this time, and had been for some months, in a state of nervous\nanxiety about his friend. He had almost admitted to himself that he\nhad been wrong in recommending a politician so weakly organised to\ntake the office of Prime Minister. He had expected the man to be\nmore manly,--had perhaps expected him to be less conscientiously\nscrupulous. But now, as the thing had been done, it must be\nmaintained. Who else was there to take the office? Mr. Gresham\nwould not. To keep Mr. Daubeny out was the very essence of the Duke\nof St. Bungay's life,--the turning-point of his political creed,\nthe one grand duty the idea of which was always present to him.\nAnd he had, moreover, a most true and most affectionate regard\nfor the man whom he now supported, appreciating the sweetness\nof his character,--believing still in the Minister's patriotism,\nintelligence, devotion, and honesty; though he was forced to own to\nhimself that the strength of a man's heart was wanting.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Warburton; \"he did mention it.\"\n\n\"Does it trouble him?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you had better speak to him about it.\" Both the old Duke and\nthe private Secretary were as fearful and nervous about the Prime\nMinister as a mother is for a weakly child. They could hardly tell\ntheir opinions to each other, but they understood one another, and\nbetween them they coddled their Prime Minister. They were specially\nnervous as to what might be done by the Prime Minister's wife,\nnervous as to what was done by every one who came in contact with\nhim. It had been once suggested by the private Secretary that Lady\nRosina should be sent for, as she had a soothing effect upon the\nPrime Minister's spirit.\n\n\"Has it irritated him?\" asked the Duke.\n\n\"Well;--yes, it has;--a little, you know. I think your Grace had\nbetter speak to him;--and not perhaps mention my name.\" The Duke of\nSt. Bungay nodded his head, and said that he would speak to the great\nman and would not mention any one's name.\n\nAnd he did speak. \"Has any one said anything to you about it?\" asked\nthe Prime Minister.\n\n\"I saw it in the 'Evening Pulpit' myself. I have not heard it\nmentioned anywhere.\"\n\n\"I did pay the man's expenses.\"\n\n\"You did!\"\n\n\"Yes,--when the election was over, and, as far as I can remember,\nsome time after it was over. He wrote to me saying that he had\nincurred such and such expenses, and asking me to repay him. I sent\nhim a cheque for the amount.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"I was bound in honour to do it.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nThere was a short pause before this second question was answered.\n\"The man had been induced to stand by representations made to him\nfrom my house. He had been, I fear, promised certain support which\ncertainly was not given him when the time came.\"\n\n\"You had not promised it?\"\n\n\"No;--not I.\"\n\n\"Was it the Duchess?\"\n\n\"Upon the whole, my friend, I think I would rather not discuss it\nfurther, even with you. It is right that you should know that I did\npay the money,--and also why I paid it. It may also be necessary that\nwe should consider whether there may be any further probable result\nfrom my doing so. But the money has been paid, by me myself,--and was\npaid for the reason I have stated.\"\n\n\"A question might be asked in the House.\"\n\n\"If so, it must be answered as I have answered you. I certainly shall\nnot shirk any responsibility that may be attached to me.\"\n\n\"You would not like Warburton to write a line to the newspaper?\"\n\n\"What;--to the 'People's Banner!'\"\n\n\"It began there, did it? No, not to the 'People's Banner,' but to the\n'Evening Pulpit.' He could say, you know, that the money was paid\nby you, and that the payment had been made because your agents had\nmisapprehended your instructions.\"\n\n\"It would not be true,\" said the Prime Minister, slowly.\n\n\"As far as I can understand that was what occurred,\" said the other\nDuke.\n\n\"My instructions were not misapprehended. They were disobeyed. I\nthink that perhaps we had better say no more about it.\"\n\n\"Do not think that I wish to press you,\" said the old man, tenderly;\n\"but I fear that something ought to be done;--I mean for your own\ncomfort.\"\n\n\"My comfort!\" said the Prime Minister. \"That has vanished long\nago;--and my peace of mind, and my happiness.\"\n\n\"There has been nothing done which cannot be explained with perfect\ntruth. There has been no impropriety.\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"The money was paid simply from an over-nice sense of honour.\"\n\n\"It cannot be explained. I cannot explain it even to you, and how\nthen can I do it to all the gaping fools of the country who are ready\nto trample upon a man simply because he is in some way conspicuous\namong them?\"\n\nAfter that the old Duke again spoke to Mr. Warburton, but Mr.\nWarburton was very loyal to his chief. \"Could one do anything by\nspeaking to the Duchess?\" said the old Duke.\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"I suppose it was her Grace who did it all.\"\n\n\"I cannot say. My own impression is that he had better wait till the\nHouses meet, and then, if any question is asked, let it be answered.\nHe himself would do it in the House of Lords, or Mr. Finn or\nBarrington Erle, in our House. It would surely be enough to explain\nthat his Grace had been made to believe that the man had received\nencouragement at Silverbridge from his own agents, which he himself\nhad not intended should be given, and that therefore he had thought\nit right to pay the money. After such an explanation what more could\nany one say?\"\n\n\"You might do it yourself.\"\n\n\"I never speak.\"\n\n\"But in such a case as that you might do so; and then there would be\nno necessity for him to talk to another person on the matter.\"\n\nSo the affair was left for the present, though the allusions to it\nin the \"People's Banner\" were still continued. Nor did any other of\nthe Prime Minister's colleagues dare to speak to him on the subject.\nBarrington Erle and Phineas Finn talked of it among themselves, but\nthey did not mention it even to the Duchess. She would have gone to\nher husband at once; and they were too careful of him to risk such a\nproceeding. It certainly was the case that among them they coddled\nthe Prime Minister.\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nCoddling the Prime Minister\n\n\nParliament was to meet on the 12th of February, and it was of course\nnecessary that there should be a Cabinet Council before that time.\nThe Prime Minister, about the end of the third week in January,\nwas prepared to name a day for this, and did so, most unwillingly.\nBut he was then ill, and talked both to his friend the old Duke\nand his private Secretary of having the meeting held without him.\n\"Impossible!\" said the old Duke.\n\n\"If I could not go it would have to be possible.\"\n\n\"We could all come here if it were necessary.\"\n\n\"Bring fourteen or fifteen ministers out of town because a poor\ncreature such as I am is ill!\" But in truth the Duke of St. Bungay\nhardly believed in this illness. The Prime Minister was unhappy\nrather than ill.\n\nBy this time everybody in the House,--and almost everybody in the\ncountry who read the newspapers,--had heard of Mr. Lopez and his\nelection expenses,--except the Duchess. No one had yet dared to tell\nher. She saw the newspapers daily, but probably did not read them\nvery attentively. Nevertheless she knew that something was wrong. Mr.\nWarburton hovered about the Prime Minister more tenderly than usual;\nthe Duke of St. Bungay was more concerned; the world around her was\nmore mysterious, and her husband more wretched. \"What is it that's\ngoing on?\" she said one day to Phineas Finn.\n\n\"Everything,--in the same dull way as usual.\"\n\n\"If you don't tell me, I'll never speak to you again. I know there is\nsomething wrong.\"\n\n\"The Duke, I'm afraid, is not quite well.\"\n\n\"What makes him ill? I know well when he's ill and when he's well.\nHe's troubled by something.\"\n\n\"I think he is, Duchess. But as he has not spoken to me I am loath to\nmake guesses. If there be anything, I can only guess at it.\"\n\nThen she questioned Mrs. Finn, and got an answer which, if not\nsatisfactory, was at any rate explanatory. \"I think he is uneasy\nabout that Silverbridge affair.\"\n\n\"What Silverbridge affair?\"\n\n\"You know that he paid the expenses which that man Lopez says that he\nincurred.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I know that.\"\n\n\"And you know that that other man Slide has found it out, and\npublished it all in the 'People's Banner'?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. And a whole army of accusations has been brought\nagainst him. I have never liked to tell you, and yet I do not think\nthat you should be left in the dark.\"\n\n\"Everybody deceives me,\" said the Duchess angrily.\n\n\"Nay;--there has been no deceit.\"\n\n\"Everybody keeps things from me. I think you will kill me among you.\nIt was my doing. Why do they attack him? I will write to the papers.\nI encouraged the man after Plantagenet had determined that he should\nnot be assisted,--and, because I had done so, he paid the man his\nbeggarly money. What is there to hurt him in that? Let me bear it. My\nback is broad enough.\"\n\n\"The Duke is very sensitive.\"\n\n\"I hate people to be sensitive. It makes them cowards. A man when he\nis afraid of being blamed, dares not at last even show himself, and\nhas to be wrapped up in lamb's wool.\"\n\n\"Of course men are differently organised.\"\n\n\"Yes;--but the worst of it is, that when they suffer from this\nweakness, which you call sensitiveness, they think that they are made\nof finer material than other people. Men shouldn't be made of S\u00e8vres\nchina, but of good stone earthenware. However, I don't want to abuse\nhim, poor fellow.\"\n\n\"I don't think you ought.\"\n\n\"I know what that means. You do want to abuse me. So they've been\nbullying him about the money he paid to that man Lopez. How did\nanybody know anything about it?\"\n\n\"Lopez must have told of it,\" said Mrs. Finn.\n\n\"The worst, my dear, of trying to know a great many people is, that\nyou are sure to get hold of some that are very bad. Now that man is\nvery bad. Yet they say he has married a nice wife.\"\n\n\"That's often the case, Duchess.\"\n\n\"And the contrary;--isn't it, my dear? But I shall have it out with\nPlantagenet. If I have to write letters to all the newspapers myself,\nI'll put it right.\" She certainly coddled her husband less than the\nothers; and, indeed, in her heart of hearts disapproved altogether\nof the coddling system. But she was wont at this particular time to\nbe somewhat tender to him because she was aware that she herself\nhad been imprudent. Since he had discovered her interference at\nSilverbridge, and had made her understand its pernicious results,\nshe had been,--not, perhaps, shamefaced, for that word describes\na condition to which hardly any series of misfortunes could have\nreduced the Duchess of Omnium,--but inclined to quiescence by\nfeelings of penitence. She was less disposed than heretofore to\nattack him with what the world of yesterday calls \"chaff,\" or with\nwhat the world of to-day calls \"cheek.\" She would not admit to\nherself that she was cowed;--but the greatness of the game and the\nhigh interest attached to her husband's position did in some degree\ndismay her. Nevertheless she executed her purpose of \"having it out\nwith Plantagenet.\" \"I have just heard,\" she said, having knocked at\nthe door of his own room, and having found him alone,--\"I have just\nheard, for the first time, that there is a row about the money you\npaid to Mr. Lopez.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"Nobody told me,--in the usual sense of the word. I presumed that\nsomething was the matter, and then I got it out from Marie. Why had\nyou not told me?\"\n\n\"Why should I tell you?\"\n\n\"But why not? If anything troubled me I should tell you. That is, if\nit troubled me much.\"\n\n\"You take it for granted that this does trouble me much.\" He was\nsmiling as he said this, but the smile passed very quickly from his\nface. \"I will not, however, deceive you. It does trouble me.\"\n\n\"I knew very well that something was wrong.\"\n\n\"I have not complained.\"\n\n\"One can see as much as that without words. What is it that you fear?\nWhat can the man do to you? What matter is it to you if such a one as\nthat pours out his malice on you? Let it run off like the rain from\nthe housetops. You are too big even to be stung by such a reptile as\nthat.\" He looked into her face, admiring the energy with which she\nspoke to him. \"As for answering him,\" she continued to say, \"that\nmay or may not be proper. If it should be done, there are people to\ndo it. But I am speaking of your own inner self. You have a shield\nagainst your equals, and a sword to attack them with if necessary.\nHave you no armour of proof against such a creature as that? Have you\nnothing inside you to make you feel that he is too contemptible to be\nregarded?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, Plantagenet!\"\n\n\"Cora, there are different natures which have each their own\nexcellencies and their own defects. I will not admit that I am a\ncoward, believing as I do that I could dare to face necessary danger.\nBut I cannot endure to have my character impugned,--even by Mr. Slide\nand Mr. Lopez.\"\n\n\"What matter,--if you are in the right?

{"ID": 610, "text": "\n[Footnote 7: Athen., VI, 63.]\n\nAllegorical impersonations, such as that of Antioch, are religious conceptions of a high order\ncompared to this. Nevertheless, one feels that such impersonations can have no separate divine\nexistence apart from the city or the people whom they represent. They are on a different plane\nof religious belief from Athena, for example, as the goddess of the city. The goddess was,\nindeed, in some ways representative of what was best in her chosen people; but she was not\na mere symbol of its character and its greatness. She existed before it, and would continue\nthough it should disappear from the earth, unlike the Fortune of Antioch, whose very existence\nwas bound up with that of the city she represented.\n\nAnother example of personification may be seen in the recumbent figures of river-gods--notably\nthat of the Nile, with his sixteen cubits, as babies, playing around him. River-gods were indeed\nan object of worship from early times in Greece, and so appear on coins and elsewhere; but\nthis figure of the Nile, a product of Alexandrian art, is not like the earlier gods, who were\nlooked upon as the givers of increase and fertility; it is a mere allegorical impersonation\nof the river, such as might be made by a modern artist who made no pretence to believe in the\nexistence of such an anthropomorphic river-god. It cannot be counted as religious art at all.\nAnd the attributes and accessories of such a figure, the crocodile and hippopotamus, the sphinx\nand corn and horn of plenty, are all of them symbolic allusions such as are suitable to such\na frigid personification. The art of Alexandria is full of such devices; that of Pergamon is\nmore vigorous and dramatic; but in both alike we find the influence of a learned study of mythology,\nfull of quaint and far-fetched allusions and symbols. The culmination of this learned mythology\nis to be seen in the great altar of Pergamon, on which the gods who are in combat with the\ngiants include not only all figures, appropriate and inappropriate, from the Hellenic pantheon,\nbut many other deities whose right of admission to that pantheon is more than doubtful. The\nfigures of the gods no longer correspond to the belief in any real divinities, but are either\nmere artistic types, repeated again and again in accordance with convention, or else they are\nregarded as symbols representing different aspects of divine power.\n\nSymbolism of this kind is a common symptom of the decay of religious faith. The more thoughtful\nor educated classes, who follow the speculations of philosophers as to the nature of the deity,\nfind it possible to reconcile these speculations with the forms of popular religion by accepting\nthe forms in a symbolic sense. The common people, on the other hand, finding the old forms\ninadequate to satisfy their religious aspirations, import new and strange divinities, whose\ncult is often mixed with magic or mystic rites."}
{"ID": 182, "text": "Alice kissed her father and mother, and went to bed; but there was a little cloud between her\nand the all-pure Being to whom she prayed that night, and her precious tears wetted my locks,\nere she went to sleep.\n\nAlice felt that she had not been true to her promise, and her parents' entire trust was the\nmost severe reproach. Still she could not quite make up her mind to say so; and she tried not\nto think so. She had set her heart upon the little work box made and ornamented by her father\nwhom she loved dearly. One day after another passed away, and every day it became harder to\nconfess her fault. How often I heard her sigh during these days! Nothing makes a perfectly\nlight heart but entire uprightness.\n\nOne day, her father called her to him, and said, \"Come, Alice, and tell me which color I shall\nuse to ornament the border of your box-- blue or green?\"\n\n\"Just which you please, Father.\"\n\n\"But you know it is for you, and I want to know what you like best.\"\n\n\"If it should ever be mine, Father, I like blue best.\"\n\n\"Blue it shall be,\" said her father. \"It will be finished to-morrow, and then your month for\nkeeping your hair tied will end. I think your eyes are better, and you have learned also that\nyou can keep a promise. You are my good child.\"\n\nAlice could not speak. She ran out of doors into her garden where her father had made her a\nlittle arbor, and there, all alone, she struggled with herself, till courage and truth prevailed.\nThen she went back into her father's study where she found him still at work on her box.\n\n\"Almost done, Alice,\" said he; \"see how pretty it is.\" \"It must not be mine, Father,\" said\nAlice, very quietly, for she was determined to command herself. \"I have not kept my promise,\nFather. I have deceived you and mother. I don't deserve the box. Give it to my cousin.\" Then\nshe told her father the whole story, just as it was. As she went on, she grew braver, and felt\nhappier; so that she was able to look up into her father's face, and say, very calmly, \"I could\nnot take any pleasure in your pretty box, for I know I do not deserve it. Please, dear Father,\nto tell Mother all about it, and put away the box, if you choose not to give it to some one\nelse. It is very pretty, but it is not to be my box.\"\n\nThe tears began to come in her eyes, and she turned to go out of the room. Her father stopped\nher. \"Come here, my Child,\" he said. \"You did wrong, but you have done all you could to repair\nyour fault. You will never again, I think, be guilty of falsehood. At the end of another month,\nif you feel sure of yourself, come to me for your box.\"\n\n\"No, Father, that would seem like being paid for speaking the truth. I should never ask for\nthe box.\"\n\n\"Would you rather I should give it to your cousin?\"\n\n\"If you please, I should;\" and then the tears ran fast down her cheeks. \"You know my cousin\nEdith has very few pretty things. I should like her to have it.\"\n\n\"Take it, Alice, and give it to her yourself.\"\n\n\"As your present, Father, not as mine. You know it is not, and cannot be mine. I have been\nso unhappy at my untruth, that I think I shall never commit such a fault again.\"\n\nAlice never did again, in the slightest thing, depart from the strictest truth and uprightness,\nin action as well as in word. It was common for her friends to say when there was a question\nabout any thing that had occurred, \"We will ask Alice. She always tells the exact truth.\"\n\nAt last, Alice was a woman; and I, of course, led a more sober life, as she became more serious.\nI grew so long and thick that, when she took out her comb, and shook her head slightly, I fell\nin curls all around her neck and shoulders, like a golden veil, and you could but just see\nher laughing blue eyes, and white teeth through me.\n\nYou may readily guess that the pretty Alice was beloved by all who knew her; and, ere long,\nthe son of the village apothecary won her heart. He was a good-hearted fellow, but never fitted\nhimself to be of much use in the world. He took Alice to a distant village, where, with his\nfather's assistance, he set up as an apothecary, on rather a small scale, of course; but Alice\nwas used to simple fare and to helping herself.\n\nAll would have been well with them but for one thing--the husband became a drunkard; not immediately--his\nlove for his wife kept him sober for some time. Nothing was more beautiful than the way they\nlived for a year or two; but the habit of drinking a little, a habit which he had formed in\nhis father's shop, and which he intended to cure, returned. The wretched man had not strength\nto resist it.\n\nHe became fretful, and Alice, for the first time in her life, became unhappy. She had never\nbefore heard any but the voice of kindness; and now, from him she loved best in the world she\nreceived sometimes sharp and disagreeable words. He was very sorry afterwards, and all would\nseem well again, but he did not really reform, and, many a time, my locks, falling over her\ninnocent round cheek, were wetted with her tears.\n\nAlice was good as an angel. She forgave her husband, believed him when he promised to leave\noff drinking, and never said a harsh word to him. James kept his promise for a month or two,\nbut fell again, and then more hopelessly; for, after he had drunk a little, he feared his wife\nwould know what he had done, and felt so unhappy that he drank more to drown his feelings;\nand, for the first time, he was brought home to his wife dead drunk.\n\nAlice tended her husband as if he were only a sick man; she had him put into a nice bed, she\nwashed and mended his soiled and torn clothes, she was near him to catch his first word when\nhe recovered his senses, she never reproached him, she tried, by love, to win him back to sobriety\nand duty, she wept, she prayed for him.\n\nHe suffered all that man can from shame; he could not look her in the face; he had destroyed\nthe charm and glory of life; he was unable, or rather he thought he was, to conquer his enemy;\nand, before six years were at an end, partly from broken and ruined health, and partly from\nutter misery, he fell into a rapid decline, and died.\n\nAlice loved her husband; and never was sick man nursed with more loving, cheerful patience\nthan was he. He wept over his sins; he asked her, with every returning and every setting sun,\nto forgive him and to pray God to pardon him.\n\nShe was an angel of pity and mercy to him, to the end. When she leaned over him to kiss him,\nhe would pull her beautiful hair--for I was still beautiful--over his face which he was ashamed\nto show when he thought of his folly and wickedness. Many a time have I felt his hot tears\nof contrition as he pressed me against his sunken cheeks, and to his parched lips.\n\nAfter her husband's death, the vicar of the parish came to see Alice, and did all he could\nto comfort and aid her.\n\nShe found that her husband had died largely in debt; that, when all the stock in his shop was\nsold, and the creditors paid, there would be nothing left for herself and two children.\n\nShe did not want to go back to her old father's house, and burden him with care and expense,\nand she resolved to open a little school for small children in the cottage in which she lived.\n\nShe had one spare room which she could let to an old lady who wanted just such a home as Alice\ncould give her.\n\nWith a strong and hopeful heart, did Alice dedicate herself to the work before her, of supporting\nand educating her two orphan children. Alice's strict honesty had made her give up to her husband's\ncreditors every thing she had, except the barest necessaries; and, now that she wanted to commence\nher school, she felt very much the want of a little cash to buy a few indispensable things.\n\nThe grocer and butcher had offered to supply her on credit, till her first payment from her\nscholars and boarder should come in. Still a little ready money was essential to her to begin.\nShe would not borrow it, and was one day thinking what she should do, when her eye, wandering\nover a newspaper which the vicar had kindly lent her, fell on an advertisement offering a high\nprice for handsome hair long and thick enough to make wigs.\n\nAlice heard the good curate say that he was going to London on business in a day or two, and\nher determination was made in a moment.\n\nI said that Alice had kept nothing that she could do without; she had, however, kept the white\nmuslin gown she wore when she was married. She thought she could not give this up. \"I shall\nnever wear a white muslin gown again,\" she said, as she ripped out one of the breadths and\nmade herself two or three plain caps of it.\n\nThe next day she rose early before the children were awake, and, standing before a very small\nlooking glass which she had kept to dress her hair, she looked at me curling all over her precious\nhead, and hanging down upon her shoulders.\n\n\"He loved these locks,\" said she, \"and, for his sake, I would keep them; but they had better\nbe devoted to the good of our children. Some school books will be worth more than all these\ngolden locks. I am glad the children are asleep, for they love to play with my hair, and it\nwould grieve them to see me cut it off.\"\n\nThe good Alice took her scissors, and cut off lock after lock, till all were gone, save a few\nwhich she left around her forehead. Then she put on her simple muslin cap and tied it with\na muslin string under her chin.\n\nJust then, her boy awoke. Alice had laid him down on his bed, and the first sight the little\nfellow saw, when he awoke, was his mother's hair which almost covered him up.\n\n\"Why, Mother, how could you do so? How could you cut off your pretty hair, and put on that\nugly cap? What would father say? You said we must do what we thought would please him. It would\nnot please him to have you cut off your pretty hair;\" and the child burst into an agony of tears.\n\n\"Would it not please him that you should have a spelling book and a slate to write on, William?\nWith this hair I can buy them for you. I have no other riches now.\"\n\nThe poor boy still wept. The hair was more to him, at that time, than all learning. He could\nnot then have believed that the time would come, when he would remember with gratitude his\nmother's sacrifice for him and his little sister.\n\nAlice gathered the locks, took from a drawer her last bit of blue ribbon, and tied them, saying,\n\"This is the way he liked to see my hair tied when I was at my father's cottage. I shall never\ntie it so again.\"\n\nWhen the good vicar came to see Alice, as he did every day, she met him with me all nicely\ndone up in a paper in her hands, and asked him if he would be so good as to take me to the\nhair dresser who had advertised for hair, make the best bargain he could for her, and, with\nthe proceeds, get the few necessaries for commencing her small school. The good man cheerfully\npromised to do so, took the parcel from Alice, and carried it to his own house.\n\nAnd so I bade farewell to dear Alice, and her neat cottage, and her sweet children. I was parted\nforever from that innocent head that had cherished only good and pure thoughts. I was no longer\nto be dressed by her dear hands. I was never again to shade and adorn her lovely face, nor\nfall in ringlets around her sloping shoulders, nor ever tremble again with the beatings of\nher gay and generous heart, as I often had when she let me fall over her neck and shoulders.\n\nNothing that ever had life in it could be insensible to such a sorrow as this. How I envied\nthe few locks she kept around her precious forehead! How I wished that scissors had never been\ninvented!\n\nThe good curate, faithful to his promise, took me to the hair dresser in London, according\nto the direction in the advertisement; and, before opening the paper which contained me, told\nhim the story of Alice, of her trials, and of her excellent character and conduct, of her present\nneed, and of her purpose to support and educate her children by her own efforts. He told him\nthat there never was such a beautiful head of hair, and that he hoped he would be willing to\ngive something handsome for it.\n\nWhen the old clergyman opened the paper, and exhibited me to the hair dresser, he took me out\nas fondly as if I had been a baby, and shook me so as to make the ringlets curl again, but\nthey would not.\n\nI felt the difference between the old man's hard fingers, and rough shake, and the soft touch\nof the dear Alice.\n\n\"Is it not beautiful?\" said the old man.\n\n\"It is well enough,\" said the dealer. \"I shall have to make a man's wig of it. The curls will\nall boil out.\"\n\nYou may imagine my horror at these words; and, as for the poor vicar, he seemed thunderstruck.\n\n\"If I had any money to spare,\" said he, \"I would buy this beautiful hair myself, and have it\nframed with a glass over it, and hang it up in my best parlor, with that blue ribbon that looks\nso like her; it's as handsome as a picture; and then her dear children should have it at my death.\"\n\nWhether it was that the hair dresser was afraid of losing me, or that his heart was slightly\ntouched with compassion for Alice and her orphan children, I know not; but he offered the good\ncurate a sum for me which satisfied him.\n\nAs the curate gave me up, he untied the blue ribbon, folded it up nicely, and put it into his\npocket; and I think he dropped a tear as he did so.\n\nThe wig maker examined me again when he was by himself. \"A fine head of hair it really is,\"\nsaid he. \"It will make a good wig for a youngish sort of a man; and the curls will make it\nwork easier.\"\n\nThen he tied me up with a piece of twine, and tossed me into a large drawer with great bunches\nof hair of all colors and fineness.\n\nHere I remained for I know not how long, without air or light, in this disagreeable company.\nAt last, one day we were all taken out, and what we were made to endure I now shudder to think\nof. We were boiled, we were pulled and mauled and greased; in short, I wonder we had a whole\nhair left; but, after undergoing every thing you can imagine, I found myself on a pole in the\nshape of a gentleman's wig, covered with high-scented pomatum and powder.\n\nNo one would have recognized me as the same beautiful hair that had adorned the head of Alice.\nThere were a number of poles with wigs on them close by me, and I knew, as a matter of course,\nthat I must look just like them. They looked perfectly hateful to me, and I felt disgusted\nwith myself, because I knew I resembled them.\n\nIt is now a puzzle to me how men could have ever been so foolish as to make such a thing as\nI am, to put on their heads; these great unmeaning curls, this ugly club, as they called it,\nhanging down behind, and this horrid grease and powder too.\n\nMost of my life, of course, has been passed in this horrid shape in which you now see me; but\nthe remembrance of my early days clings to me, and the love of freedom, and the sense of beauty\nwhich I acquired when the wind played through my natural curls as they covered the head of\nmy dear Alice, have never forsaken me. It was then only that I truly lived. But, forgive me--I\nhave the weakness of old age, and love to talk of youthful pleasures.\n\nOne morning, in the year seventeen hundred and seventy-eight, when I was just twenty-eight\nyears old, a gentleman of middle age came into the hair dresser's shop, and asked to look at\nhis wigs. I was shown to him with some others. After examining us all, and trying on several,\nhe chose me, because, he said, he thought I was made of the finest hair.\n\n\"This,\" said he, \"will visit the American colonies, and probably remain there, for that will,\nI think, be my home.\"\n\nI rejoiced to hear this, for I was weary of my present life, and longed for some variety.\n\nThe good gentleman who purchased me seemed well satisfied with my looks; but, when I saw myself\nin the glass, upon his long, narrow face, with his great bottle nose, and cheeks like the sides\nof a sulky, and all my pretty curls and my bright color gone, I wonder that each hair did not\nstand on end with fright; most likely it would have stood up, but for weight of pomatum and powder.\n\nSoon after my owner purchased me, he set sail for America. As I was his new and best wig, I\nwas packed carefully in a box, and knew nothing till he arrived here, and was settled in his\nplace of residence.\n\nThe first time I was taken out of my box was on Sunday, when I was carefully adjusted on the\nSquire's head. I call him Squire, for I soon found that Squire was the title every one gave\nhim, as he was the most important personage in the town in which he lived. I was as well pleased\nas a wig could be with the appearance of things in and around the house I was to inhabit. It\nwas in a village about thirty miles from Boston, and was like an English country gentleman's\nhouse. A wide hall passed through the middle of it, with a grand staircase. From the doors\nat either end of the hall ran rows of elm trees. One led to the high road, the other up a gentle\nhill, on the top of which was a pretty burying ground with a path through it leading to a small\nchurch.\n\nThe Squire had a black man whom he called his boy, and who was, in fact, his slave, but whom\nhe treated like a friend and brother.\n\nSome years after, when slavery was abolished in Massachusetts, the Squire called Cato to him,\nand said, \"Cato, you are no longer my slave; you are free.\"\n\n\"But, massa, you will not sell me.\"\n\n\"No, Cato, you are a freeman; I have no right to sell you. I don't think I ever had any right\nto sell you; but now the law of the land makes you free, and I am glad of it.\"\n\n\"Then I can stay with you of my own free will, massa.\"\n\n\"Yes, Cato, you can stay or go, just as you please.\"\n\n\"Then, massa, I stay with you for love, and not cause I am your slave. Now I your friend.\"\nAnd Cato never left the Squire till the day of his death. But to return to my story.\n\nThe Squire, as I said, put me on very carefully, and then as carefully put over me his three-cornered\nhat, and took his gold- headed cane, and, with Cato behind him, walked reverently up the hill\nto church.\n\nI was accustomed to the Episcopal church, where dear Alice went every Sunday; but this was\na Presbyterian church, and I had never been in one before.\n\nAs I said, had not my hairs lost their power of motion by what I had endured from the scissors,\nand the vile process of making me into my present shape, every one of them would have risen\nup against the so- called music in this church; but my misfortunes and pomatum kept me quiet."}

Respect the property of others.\n\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nDuring the hike your equipment for living will be limited to: (1) your\npack (things that you carry on your back), (2) a few authorized articles\nwhich are placed in a squad laundry bag (called a surplus kit), and (3)\na blanket roll.\n\nContents of the Pack\n\n1 bacon can.\n1 condiment can.\n1 blanket.\n1 poncho.\n1 shelter half (one-half of a small tent)\n5 small tent pins.\n1 tooth brush.\n1 comb and any other toilet articles desired.\n1 cake of soap.\n1 or 2 towels.\n1 extra suit of underwear.\n1 pair socks.\n1 pair shoe strings.\n\n\nContents of Surplus Kit\n\n1 pair of breeches.\n1 suit of underwear.\n1 shirt, olive drab.\n1 shoe laces.\n2 pair of socks.\n1 pair of shoes (tan).\n\nAny other article that may be prescribed by the company commander.\n\nThe surplus kit of each man will be made up into a neat, compact bundle,\ntied with a string (use a shoe string for the purpose), and tagged with\nthe owner's name. These individual kits will be packed in a laundry bag,\ncalled \"surplus kit bag,\" tagged, one for each squad.\n\n     Contents of Blanket Roll\n\n     1. Extra blankets.\n\n     2. One ramrod for each squad.\n\n     3. Any other articles that may be prescribed by the company\n     commander.\n\nEach squad makes these extra blankets, etc., into a long roll which is\ncalled the \"squad blanket roll.\" A tag is tied to it, showing to what\nregiment, company, and squad it belongs.\n\n\nNotes\n\n1. The bacon can is a convenient place to carry a small face towel,\nshaving outfit, and other small toilet articles.\n\n2. Keep your soap in a soap box.\n\n3. Each squad should have its own cleaning material which should be tied\ninto a small package and carried in the surplus kit bag.\n\n4. Interest in a hike or a manoeuver will be stimulated if at least one\nmember of each squad has a map showing all the camp sites and route of\nmarch.\n\n5. One man in each squad should be provided with a small bottle of\niodine, some absorbent cotton and adhesive tape for the common use of\nthe squad. This saves time for the surgeon and men in caring for minor\ninjuries, scratches, etc.\n\n\nESPRIT DE CORPS\n\n\nHave too much esprit de corps to complain of the length of the march, or\nto kick about the dust on the road. Be self-controlled. Don't boast of\nyour ability to march on forever. Such remarks are depressing to a tired\ncomrade who is not as physically strong as you.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS\n\n\nTo make it possible to fill the gaps made in the Regular Army, by the\nheavy loss of commissioned officers which is inevitable in time of war\nand to make it possible to train large volunteer armies which are called\ninto existence when war is imminent or actually upon the country, the\nGovernment has provided for an Officers' Reserve Corps.\n\nIt is, indeed, a patriotic and far-sighted act on the part of a citizen\nto become a reserve officer, for, by so doing, he will increase his\nmeasure of usefulness for the time when his country will need him most\nand when he will, if he is a real, virile man, desire to be of the\nutmost service to his country.\n\nThe President alone is authorized to appoint officers in the Reserve\nCorps. Each officer must be physically, mentally, and morally qualified\nto hold his commission. The highest rank in the reserve corps will be\nthat of major.\n\nAge limits for appointment in the line of the Reserve Corps:\n\n2nd Lieutenants must be under 32 years of age.\n\n1st Lieutenants must be under 36 years of age.\n\nCaptains must be under 40 years of age.\n\nMajors must be under 45 years of age.\n\nAny citizen who thinks that he has the necessary qualifications and\ndesires to become a reserve officer should apply to the Commanding\nGeneral of the Department wherein he resides for an application blank\nand all information pertaining thereto.\n\nYou must undergo a course of training in camp. We advise you in the\nstrongest terms to go to camp as soon as possible. There are no short\ncuts in the military business. The most efficient instruction under the\nmost ideal conditions with the most competent officers, will be found\nonly in camp.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE OFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS\n\n\nAn officer in the Reserve Corps cannot, without his consent, be called\ninto service in a lower grade than that held by him in the Reserve\nCorps.\n\nWhen a Reserve Officer reaches the age limit fixed for appointment or\nreappointment in the grade in which commissioned, he will be honorably\ndischarged from the service of the United States and he will be entitled\nto retain his official title, and, on occasions of ceremony, to wear the\nuniform of the highest grade he held in the Reserve Corps. The preceding\nprovisions as to ages of officers do not apply to the appointment or\nreappointment of officers of the Quartermaster, Engineer, Ordnance,\nSignal, Judge Advocate, and Medical Sections of the Reserve Corps.\n\nA commission in the Reserve Corps will cover a period of five years,\nexcept as provided in the preceding paragraph, unless sooner terminated\nin the discretion of the President. An officer may be recommissioned,\neither in the same or a higher grade for successive periods of five\nyears, subject to examination and age limits.\n\nTo become eligible for appointment as an officer of the Officers'\nReserve Corps a man must be not less than twenty-one years of age and\nmust be a citizen of the United States.\n\n\nTHE OFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS IN WAR\n\n\nIn time of actual or threatened hostilities the President can order\nofficers of the Reserve Corps to temporary duty with the Regular Army,\nor as officers at recruiting rendezvous and depots, or on such duty as\nhe may prescribe. An officer thus called into service receives the same\npay and allowances as an officer of the same rank in the Regular Army.\nWhen thus called out Reserve Officers may be promoted in rank to\nvacancies in volunteer organizations. Retired officers of the Officers'\nReserve Corps are not entitled to retired pay but are entitled to\npensions for disability incurred in line of duty and while in active\nservice. When called out for active service an officer in the Reserve\nCorps will be required to obey the laws and regulations for the\ngovernment of the Army of the United States in so far as they are\napplicable to officers whose permanent retention in the military service\nis not contemplated.\n\n\nTHE OFFICERS' RESERVE CORPS IN PEACE\n\n\nDuring peace the Secretary of War can order any Reserve Officer to duty\nfor instruction for a period not to exceed fifteen days in any one\ncalendar year. While so serving, an officer will receive the pay and\nallowance of his grade in the Regular Army. This period of service may\nbe extended with the consent of the Reserve Officer. By thus extending\nsuch periods of instruction a Reserve Officer may, at the conclusion\nthereof, be examined for promotion to the next higher grade.\n\n\nEXAMINATIONS\n\n\nEach applicant for a commission in the Reserve Corps will be given a\nrigid physical examination. Make certain that you can pass such an\nexamination. Go to your family physician and get him to examine you.\n\nThe examinations for Reserve Corps commissions are for the purpose of\nascertaining the practical ability of the applicant. The record of all\nthe service and training the applicant has had at training camps is\nconsidered as part of the examination.\n\nThose desiring to enter the Officers' Reserve Corps may elect any of the\nfollowing sections:\n\n 1. Infantry Officers' Reserve Corps.\n 2. Cavalry Officers' Reserve Corps.\n 3. Field Artillery Officers' Reserve Corps.\n 4. Coast Artillery Officers' Reserve Corps.\n 5. Medical (to include the reserve officers of the Medical Corps, Dental\n    Corps, and Veterinary Corps) Officers' Reserve Corps.\n 6. Adjutant General's Officers' Reserve Corps.\n 7. Judge Advocate General's Officers' Reserve Corps.\n 8. Inspector General's Officers' Reserve Corps.\n 9. Quartermaster Officers' Reserve Corps.\n10. Engineer Officers' Reserve Corps.\n11. Ordnance Officers' Reserve Corps.\n12. Signal Officers' Reserve Corps.\n\n\nREPORTS TO BE MADE\n\n\nOfficers in the Officers' Reserve Corps are required to report at once\nto the Adjutant General of the Department in which they live or to the\nheads of the Staff Corps or Departments to which they may belong of any\npermanent change of address. If a change of address to any other\ndepartment is involved the adjutant of each department should be\nnotified.\n\n\nTHE RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS\n\n\nThe President is authorized to establish and maintain in civil\neducational institutions a Reserve Officers' Training Corps which shall\nconsist of senior and junior divisions.\n\n\nSENIOR DIVISION\n\n\nA senior division of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps may be\nestablished at any university and college requiring of its students four\nyears of collegiate study for a degree, and at essentially military\nschools which, as a result of annual inspection of such institutions by\nthe War Department, are especially designated as qualified to establish\na unit of the senior division. Authorities of the former (universities\nand colleges not essentially military) must establish and maintain a two\nyears' elective or compulsory course of military training, as a minimum,\nfor its physically fit male students. This course, when entered upon,\nmust in the case of such students be a prerequisite for graduation.\n\nWhen any member of this senior division has completed two academic years\nof service in that division; has been selected by the president of the\ninstitution and by its professor of military science and tactics (who\nmust be an army officer); has made a written agreement to continue in\nthe Reserve Officers' Training Corps for the remainder of his course in\nthe institution, devoting five hours per week to the military training\nprescribed by the Secretary of War; has also made a written agreement to\npursue the courses in training camps (one camp of not more than six\nweeks' duration each year) prescribed by the Secretary of War)--when he\nhas fulfilled all these conditions, he may be given, at the expense of\nthe United States, a money commutation of subsistence at a rate not\nexceeding the cost of the garrison (army) ration during the remainder of\nhis service in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. This will amount to\nabout thirty cents a day. This provision applies only to the senior\ndivision.\n\n\nJUNIOR DIVISION\n\n\nA junior division of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps may be\nestablished at any institution to which an army officer has been\ndetailed as the professor of military science and tactics, and which\ncannot meet the necessary requirements for the senior division. In this\ncase the Government does not give a commutation of subsistence and the\nstudents are not asked to obligate themselves as in the senior division.\n\n\nTO ENTER THE RESERVE OFFICERS' CORPS\n\n\nThe President is authorized, under such regulations as he may prescribe,\nto appoint in the Officers' Reserve Corps any graduate of the senior\ndivision of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, who shall have\nsatisfactorily completed the two-year course of training (five hours a\nweek), incident to receiving a commutation of rations; also any graduate\nof the junior division who shall have satisfactorily completed the\ncourses of military training prescribed for students of the senior\ndivisions, referred to in the first part of this paragraph, and shall\nhave participated in such practical instruction, subsequent to\ngraduation, as the Secretary of War shall have prescribed. They must be\ntwenty-one years of age and must make written agreement under oath to\nserve the United States for ten years.\n\nAny physically fit male citizen of the United States, between the ages\nof twenty-one and twenty-seven years, who graduated prior to June 22,\n1916, from any educational institution at which an officer of the Army\nwas detailed as professor of military science and tactics, and who,\nwhile a student at such institution, completed courses of military\ntraining substantially equivalent to those prescribed for the senior\ndivision of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, may, after\nsatisfactorily completing such additional practical military training as\nthe Secretary of War shall prescribe, be eligible for appointment to the\nOfficers' Reserve Corps.\n\nThe President can appoint and commission, as a temporary second\nlieutenant of the Regular Army in time of peace, for the purpose of\ninstruction and for a period not to exceed six months, any Reserve\nOfficer who was appointed in the manner described in the two preceding\nparagraphs. A temporary second lieutenant will receive the allowance\nauthorized by law for that grade and pay at the rate of $100 a month. He\nwill be attached to a unit of the Regular Army for duty and training. At\nthe end of the six months he will revert to the status of a Reserve\nOfficer.\n\n\nDEPARTMENT COMMANDER'S REPORT\n\n\nAt the end of each calendar year department commanders and chiefs of\nstaff corps and departments compile lists of members of the Officers'\nReserve Corps under their command, showing:\n\n    (a) Name, rank, age, and address.\n    (b) Amount of instruction received.\n    (c) Progress made.\n    (d) Efficiency of officer.\n    (e) Recommendation.\n\nA copy of these lists will be forwarded to the Adjutant General of the\nArmy.\n\nThe remainder of this chapter boils down to an irreducible minimum some\nof the most important subjects with which a Reserve Officer or an\napplicant for a commission in the Officers' Reserve Corps should be\nfamiliar. It emphasizes those things with which a reserve officer should\nat once become familiar.[A] It merely opens up a broad field of study\nfor a reserve officer and at the same time can be used as a place of\nreference.\n\n\nTHE LAND FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n\nYou now are, or expect to become, a member of the land forces of the\nUnited States. Of what do the land forces of the United States consist?\nThey consist of the Regular Army, the Volunteer Army, the Officers'\nReserve Corps, the Enlisted Reserve Corps, the National Army, the\nNational Guard in the service of the United States and such other land\nforces as Congress may authorize.\n\nThe land forces are grouped under two general heads:\n\n    (1) The Mobile Army.\n    (2) The Coast Artillery.\n\n\"The Mobile Army. The mobile army is primarily organized for offensive\noperations against an enemy, and on this account requires the maximum\ndegree of mobility.\" (Field Service Regulations.) It consists of:\n\n    Infantry.\n    Field Artillery.\n    Cavalry.\n    Engineers.\n    Signal Corps Troops.\n\n\"The Coast Artillery. The coast artillery is charged with the care and\nuse of the fixed and movable elements of the land and coast\nfortifications.\" (Field Service Regulations.)\n\nThe President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief of the\nArmy. He exercises his command through the Secretary of War. The Chief\nof Staff acts as military adviser to the Secretary of War. He puts into\neffect the Administration's wishes.\n\nFor the purpose of equipping, inspecting, directing, and administering\nto the Army, there are the following corps and departments:\n\n     (1) General Staff Corps.\n     (2) Adjutant General's Department.\n     (3) Inspector General's Department.\n     (4) Judge Advocate General's Department.\n     (5) Quartermaster Corps.\n     (6) Medical Department.\n     (7) Ordnance Department.\n     (8) Bureau of Insular Affairs.\n     (9) Signal Corps.\n    (10) Engineer Corps.\n\nThe following are the grades of rank and commands of officers and\nnoncommissioned officers:\n\n (1) General                                     Commands: Armies.\n (2) Lieutenant-General                          Commands: Field Army.\n (3) Major-General                               Commands: Division.\n (4) Brigadier-General                           Commands: Brigade.\n (5) Colonel                                     Commands: Regiment.\n (6) Lieutenant-Colonel                          Second in command in a Regiment.\n (7) Major                                       Commands: Battalion.\n (8) Captain                                     Commands: Company.\n (9) First Lieutenant                            Commands: Platoon.\n(10) Second Lieutenant                           Commands: Platoon.\n(11) Veterinarian                                He has no command.\n(12) Cadet at United States Military Academy     He has no command.\n(13) Sergeant-Major (Regimental)                 He has no command.\n(14) Ordnance Sergeant                           He has no command.\n(15) Quartermaster Sergeant                      He has no command.\n(16) Sergeant-Major (Battalion)                  He has no command.\n(17) First Sergeant                              Commands: Platoon.\n(18) Sergeant                                    Commands: Sometimes a Platoon.\n(19) Corporal                                    Commands: Squad.\n\n\nARTICLES OF WAR\n\n\nThe Army is governed by the Articles of War, which can be found in the\nArmy Regulations. Any laws, orders, et cetera, pertaining to the Army\nmust not violate directly or indirectly any of the Articles of War. It\nis therefore desirable that each Reserve Officer know where to find them\nand become, in a general way, familiar with them.\n\n\nGENERAL ADVICE\n\n\nTo become a first-class drillmaster is desirable and necessary. But,\nbeing one, you are not to be intrusted with the command of troops in the\nfield unless you have gone much farther than that. To become an\nexcellent drillmaster means simply that you have mastered a detail. In\norder to become one you should bear this in mind: You cannot teach a man\nhow to do a thing unless you know that thing yourself. If you don't know\nyour drill, don't try to \"bluff\" your men. Burn the midnight oil, or\nremain a private.\n\n\nMILITARY CORRESPONDENCE\n\n\nAn official letter should refer to one subject only.\n\nIn writing to the War Department address your letter to \"The Adjutant\nGeneral of the Army, Washington, D. C.\"\n\nThe United States (including colonies) is divided into the following\ndepartments:\n\n     (1) The Northeastern Department, with Headquarters at Boston,\n     Massachusetts.\n\n     (2) The Eastern Department, with headquarters at Governors Island,\n     New York.\n\n     (3) The Southeastern Department, with Headquarters at Charleston,\n     South Carolina.\n\n     (4) The Central Department, with Headquarters at Chicago, Illinois.\n\n     (5) The Southern Department, with Headquarters at Fort Sam Houston,\n     Texas.\n\n     (6) The Western Department, with Headquarters at San Francisco,\n     California.\n\n     (7) The Philippine Department, with Headquarters at Manila.

This correspondence is not complete but it illustrates how to\nwrite a military letter and indorsement.)\n\n\nUSE OF THE COMBINED ARMS\n\n\nEvery efficient officer must realize the possibilities and limitations\nof his own arm of the service as well as the possibilities and\nlimitations of the other arms. Each arm of the service is necessary and\nimportant. A proper understanding of the use of the combined arms is as\nessential to success in battle as co\u00f6peration between the different\nmembers of a football team is to its success. Don't \"knock\" any arm but\nthe one you are in, and don't knock that unless you are willing to admit\nyou are not man enough to improve it.\n\n\nINFANTRY\n\n\n\"The infantry is the principal and most important arm, which is charged\nwith the main work on the field of battle and it usually decides the\nfinal issue of the combat.\" (Field Service Regulations.) The r\u00f4le (duty\nor job) of the infantry, whether offensive or defensive, is the r\u00f4le of\nthe entire force. If it fails, all fail. When properly supported by\nartillery, trained infantrymen armed with rifles, bayonets, and the will\nto put the enemy out of action, will settle all issues.\n\n\nARTILLERY\n\n\nThe chief duty of the artillery is to support the infantry. It does this\nin three ways: 1st, By firing at the hostile infantry. 2d, By putting\nout of action the hostile artillery so that it cannot fire at the\ninfantry. 3d, By demolishing the obstacles in front of the enemy's\nworks. It smothers the enemy with a curtain of fire, so that the\ninfantry can move forward without ruinous losses. Co\u00f6peration with the\ninfantry is essential. If the infantry is defeated the artillery covers\nits withdrawal; if the infantry is successful the artillery moves\nforward and assists in reaping the full reward of victory by firing on\nthe fleeing enemy. The present European War has greatly increased the\nprestige and importance of this arm of the service. The amount of\nartillery on the Western front and the amount of ammunition consumed\ndaily is appalling.\n\n\nCAVALRY\n\n\nThis very important arm is the eye with which the general sees for many\nmiles to the front and flank. In an advance it pushes ahead, combs the\ncountry for the enemy, disperses his cavalry, and thus protects the\ninfantry in the rear. It locates the enemy, and occupies his attention\nuntil the infantry comes up. It protects the flanks and rear of the\ninfantry and artillery during the fight. If needed, it joins in the\nfight. If the infantry is defeated it covers the withdrawal, and if the\ninfantry wins it pursues and pounces upon the enemy.\n\n\nMACHINE GUNS\n\n\nBefore the present European War, machine guns were classified as\nemergency weapons. It was not believed that they could remain long in\naction, because they would soon be silenced by hostile fire (artillery\nand infantry). It was recommended, therefore, that a favorable\nopportunity be awaited before opening fire which was to be delivered\nwith their utmost effectiveness. They were believed to possess very\nlimited possibilities in an attacking line, hut as being most valuable\nin defensive works where protection and concealment could be found.\n\nDuring this war they have lost, as a defensive weapon, no prestige. They\nhave also proved of great value to the attacking side. They are being\nmade light and portable to accompany the firing line in an attack. The\nsupply of ammunition alone limits the number that can be used.\n\nEach side in the present war has used them by the thousands with\neffectiveness. Machine guns are more worthy of consideration to-day than\nheretofore.\n\n\nBOMBS AND HAND GRENADES\n\n\nThe present European War has revived the use of hand grenades and bombs.\nA certain number of soldiers in each British and French battalion are\ntrained as grenade throwers. Their principal weapon is a bucket or bag\nof grenades or bombs. They operate not only from trenches but accompany\nthe firing line in an attack and dispose of sheltered or isolated group\nof the enemy by smothering their position with a shower of hand grenades\nor bombs.\n\nThese weapons are in the first stages of development in this country."}

{"ID": 1745, "text": "Her mother appealed\nto her, her father scolded, all in vain.  Anger was roused on both sides, until at length in\nungovernable rage the father cursed his daughter, and as his curse fell on her, the weeping\ngirl was changed into a crystal stream, which soon became a river; a beautiful, rapid river,\nfor ever winding its way with a low, sad murmur, in storm or sunshine, through the land she\nloved so well, on and on to the great salt ocean.\n\nThe angry parents, heartbroken and desolate, had returned to their lonely home, and Tamara,\nwith low, sad sighs, was fleeing further and further from her sleeping lovers, when Tavy at\nlast awoke.  He sat up and glared around him, too dazed to realize at first all that had happened.\nHe looked at Tawridge, lying fast asleep, and recollection began to return,--he looked for\nTamara,--she was gone!\n\nIn a frenzy of fear lest he should have lost his new-found love for ever, he rushed hither\nand thither, wildly searching for her,--but, of course, in vain.\n\n\"Tamara! Tamara!\" he called despairingly; no answer came.  No sound reached him but the sweet,\nsad voice of a stream hard by, a stream he did not remember to have heard before.  He was too\nfull of his troubles, though, to pay heed to such trifles now.\n\nFlying as fast as the wind to his father amongst the hills, he told him his pitiful tale, but\nthe giant already knew all that had happened, for he had powers his son had not.\n\n\"My boy,\" he said sadly, \"your Tamara is gone.  Cruelly taken from you. I cannot bring her\nback to you, but I can send you to her.  Grieved I shall be to lose my son, but I cannot keep\nyou here and see your life filled with endless pain.\"  Then the old giant kissed his son, and\nas he kissed him he turned him into a stream, which, noisy and turbulent as poor Tavy himself\nhad been of old, rushed madly on over rock and moor, seeking his lost love.  Wildly he dashed\nahead, seeking to overtake her, until at last in a gentle valley where she loitered slowly,\nhe came upon her, and, happy that they had met at last, hand in hand they glided softly onwards\nto the eternal sea.\n\nDuring all this time poor Tawridge slept on, dreaming of Tamara, that she was his, and nothing\ncould part them; but alas, alas for his waking! He opened his eyes and found it was but a dream!\nTamara was gone, Tavy was gone, and he was left alone.\n\n\"They have gone together!\" was his first thought, but then he remembered the arrival of the\nfather and mother, and his second thought was that Tamara had been taken back to her home by\nher parents, and that Tavy had killed himself in despair.  And Tawridge was filled with a double\ngrief, for he had really loved poor Tavy.\n\nIn the hills there lived an Enchanter, and to him Tawridge ran for help, and of him he learnt\nthe truth,--that both were lost to him, and were together.  The knowledge drove him to frenzy.\nWithout a thought for his father or mother, or anyone else who loved him, he begged and implored\nthe Enchanter to turn him into a stream too, that he might follow the others and overtake them,\nand once again be with his lost love, or near her.\n\nAt last the old Enchanter consented, and Tawridge was turned into a swiftly flowing river;\nand there his troubles might have ended, and the three friends have been reunited, but, as\nhe was going back, Tawridge mistook the way, and, instead of flowing towards the sea with Tamara\nand Tavy, he rushed on wildly seeking them in the wrong direction.  Calling to them with heartbroken\ncries and moans, he hurried faster and faster in his longing to overtake them, but always in\nthe wrong direction, ever and ever flowing farther from them, never to meet his lost love again.\n\nTo this day the Tamar and the Tavy run always side by side, and the Taw, still sighing and\nmoaning sadly, rushes in the opposite direction, and never can the enchantment be removed from\nTamara and her lovers, until we, having grown better and wiser, become friends again with the\nBig People and the Little People we have driven from us by our ignorance and narrow minds.\n\nTHE STRANGE STORY OF CHERRY HONEY.\n\nCherry Honey, with her father and mother, and a half-score of brothers and sisters, lived in\na little hut at Trereen, in the parish of Zennor. They were very poor people, terribly poor,\nfor all they had to live on was what they could get out of a few acres of ground that they\nowned,--ground as barren as any you could find thereabouts, and that is saying a good deal.\nFor food they lived mostly on fish and potatoes, except on Sundays, when they had pork, and\nthe broth it was boiled in; and twice a year, at Christmas and Feast-day, they had, as a great\nluxury, white bread.\n\nWhether fish and potatoes make people strong, or whether the air at Trereen was specially good,\nI can't tell, but sure enough it is that all Tom Honey's children grew up into fine, handsome\nmen and women, and not one weakly one amongst them.\n\nThey were a lively crew too, as merry as grigs in spite of the cold and the hunger that they\nfelt pretty often, and the liveliest and merriest of the lot was Cherry.  She was full of pranks\nand mischief, and led the others a pretty life.  When the miller's boy came to know if they\nwanted to send any corn to be ground, Cherry would slip out, mount his horse, which he left\nfastened up close by, and off she would go, racing as hard as she could go all along the very\nedge of the cliff, and away to the Downs, the miller's boy racing and yelling after her, but\nhe might as well have tried to catch a will-o'-the-wisp.\n\nSo Cherry went on very happily, working very hard and playing too, until she reached the age\nof sixteen or so, when she began to feel a wish to see more life than that lonely moor provided,\nand have a change from the tiny hut which could not hold a half of them comfortably.  She wanted\na new gown too, her mother had promised it to her ever since she was thirteen, and she had\nlooked forward to it even more than she did to Feasten-Sunday, for she had never had a new\nfrock in her life.  She could not enjoy Feasten-Sunday either, unless she was dressed as nicely\nas other girls.\n\nYear after year, though, she was disappointed, there was no money and no new dress, and poor\nCherry had to content herself with a clean apron over her shabby old frock, which had been\npatched and mended until there was only one piece of the original left, and no one but Cherry\nherself could have told which that was.\n\nShe was not fit to go to church or to fair, and she felt it very hard that she could never\nenjoy herself.  And then, to make matters worse, her great friend Tamsin Bray, who was a year\nyounger than Cherry, had a beautiful frock all trimmed with ribbons, and she wore it to Nancledry\nto the preaching there, and had a fine time there, full of adventures and new experiences,\nas she took care to tell poor Cherry when she came back, making Cherry feel more dissatisfied\nthan ever.  She knew she was a prettier girl than Tamsin, and would get more admiration if\nshe only had the chance.\n\nAfter that Cherry could no longer go on bearing things as they were. If her mother couldn't\nbuy her a new frock, she would go to work, and earn one for herself, she determined.  So she\ntold her parents she was going to look for a situation, and nothing they could say could make\nher change her mind, so they gave up trying to.\n\n\"Why don't 'ee try and get a place down to Towednack?\" asked her mother, who wanted her not\nto go far from home.\n\n\"Iss, fay, mother,\" answered Cherry sharply, \"a likely tale I'm going to live in a place where\nthe cow ate the bell-rope, and where they've nothing but fish and taties all the year round,\nexcept Sundays, when they have conger-pie!  Dear no, I'm going where I can get butcher's meat\nsometimes, and a bit of saffern cake when I wants it!\"\n\nSo Cherry packed up her few garments, which made but a very small bundle, and started off,\nafter promising her father not to go too far, and to come home soon.  She had been so restless\nand uneasy, that the poor man thought she was bewitched, or something.  He feared, too, that\nshe might get carried off by pirates, for there were many of them about Cornwall in those days,\nand Cherry was an attractive-looking girl, and rather flighty, as her mother often said.\n\nWhen Cherry had said 'good-bye' and kissed them all, and got outside, she had not the slightest\nnotion which way to go, so she took the road to Ludgvan and Gulval, and walked on briskly enough\nfor a time; but when she turned round for a last look at the old home, and found that it was\nno longer in sight, she felt so miserable that she had a very good mind to turn round and go\nback.  It was the first time she had ever been away, and she felt very home-sick and lonesome.\nIndeed, the outlook was enough to damp her spirits and even frighten her, for she had no friends\nto go to, nor a situation.  She did not even know where she should find shelter that night,\nand she had only one penny in her pocket.  However, she started on again, and trudged along\nthe lonely road until she came to the four cross-roads on the Lady Downs.\n\nHere she paused again, and rested while she tried to make up her mind which of the four roads\nshe should take.  All around her the Downs stretched, looking bleak and wild; and all the stories\nshe had ever heard of highwaymen and pirates, witches and fairies, came rushing helter-skelter\nthrough her poor brain until she felt too terrified to walk on or to turn back; and at last\nshe sat down on a big stone by the side of the road and burst out crying.\n\nShe did cry too, most bitterly, and never stopped until she had made up her mind to retrace\nher steps, and go home as fast as she could go. Having settled that, she felt much happier,\nand drying her eyes she started up, only too anxious to get out of that great wilderness. She\nwondered if her brothers and sisters would laugh at her.  Yes, she felt sure that they would,\nbut she did not care, she told herself. She would soon play them some trick that would make\nthem laugh the other side of their faces.  Her father and mother would welcome her back gladly,\nshe knew.\n\nSo she turned her face towards home, and was trying not to feel ashamed of her want of pluck,--when\nshe saw a gentleman on the road just ahead of her, and walking towards her.  She was astonished,\nand just a little alarmed, for a moment before there was not a soul to be seen.  She was so\nastonished that she quite forgot her manners, and stood staring and staring at the gentleman\nuntil he had come quite close to her.  Then he stared hard at Cherry, but it was not a rude\nstare, and he took off his hat so politely, and smiled so pleasantly, that Cherry was quite\nimpressed.\n\n\"Can you tell me the way to Towednack?\" he asked in a voice as pleasant as his smile.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Cherry, curtseying.  \"If you'll please to walk a little way with me, sir,\nI'll put you in the right road.\"\n\nThe gentleman thanked her, and as he walked along beside her, he asked which way she was going,\nand where she lived, and he was so kind and had such a pleasant way with him, that Cherry had\nsoon told him her history, and how she had left home to go to look for a 'place,' and how she\nhad felt so lonesome on the Downs, and so home-sick, that she had changed her mind and was\ngoing straight back again.\n\n\"Well, this is strange!\" exclaimed the gentleman.  \"Of all the good luck this is the greatest!\nI have come out to-day to see if I can find a good active girl in one of the villages, for\nI want a servant; and here I find just what I am looking for, a handsome, sharp young woman,\ncleanly and honest.\"\n\nHe could judge for himself what sort of a girl Cherry was, by her appearance, and her clean,\nwell-mended frock.\n\nHe went on to tell her that he was a widower with one little boy, for whom he wanted a nurse,\nand would Cherry come and take the post?\n\nHe talked for a long time very earnestly and winningly.  Cherry did not understand a half that\nhe said, but she understood enough to make her feel that this would be a better situation for\nher than she had ever dreamed of getting, and before very long she consented to go.\n\nThe gentleman seemed very pleased, and away they started together at once, the stranger talking\nvery fast all the time, and making himself so entertaining that Cherry never noticed how far\nthey were going, nor in what direction.\n\nThey walked through such beautiful lanes that it was quite a pleasure to be in them, hung as\nthey were with honeysuckles and roses, and many other beautiful flowers, such as Cherry rarely\nsaw anywhere near her bleak home.\n\nBy and by the light began to fail, which rather surprised Cherry, who had no idea the day was\nso far gone.  She had no watch or means of telling the time, so she supposed it was all right,\nand that she had sat crying longer than she thought.  Presently they came to a river, and Cherry\nwondered how she should cross it, for it had grown so dark by that time she could not see stepping-stones,\nor bridge, or anything.\n\nHowever, while she was wondering, the gentleman just picked her up in his arms and carried\nher across, and then on they walked again.  They went down, down and down a very steep lane\nnow, a lane which got narrower and narrower, and was so steep and long, Cherry thought it would\nnever end. Not that she minded much, for she did not feel tired, and the gentleman had given\nher his arm, that she might not stumble, and she felt so excited and happy she could have walked\non through the sweet-scented darkness for ever.\n\nShe had not much further to go, though, for presently they came to a gate which the gentleman\nopened.  \"This is your new home, Cherry,\" he said kindly, and Cherry found herself suddenly\nin the most beautiful garden you can imagine.  It was full of lovely flowers and luscious fruits,\nwhile flitting about everywhere, or perching on the trees, were birds of all sizes and colours,\ntiny blue birds, large scarlet birds, some that flashed like silver, and gold, and beaten copper,\nin the sunlight.  For oddly enough the sun was shining brightly in the garden, though it had\nlong been dark outside.\n\nCherry stood and stared about her in open-eyed amazement.  \"Dear, dear,\" she thought to herself,\n\"'tis just like the fairy-tales Gammer tells us winter evenings!\" and she began to wonder if\nshe could have got into an enchanted place, and if she should presently see fairies, or enchanted\npeople there.  But no, it could not be any fairy-tale, for there was her new master standing\nby her as big as Farmer Chenoweth, and down the path came running a little boy, calling \"Papa!\npapa!\" just as any ordinary mortal child would.\n\nThough, as Cherry said afterwards, there was something uncanny about the child, for he had\nsuch an odd, old face and expression, and eyes as cunning as might be, and so bright and piercing\nthey seemed to look you through and through; yet he appeared to be no more than four years old.\n\nBefore the child could reach them, an old woman came running out after him, and seizing him\nby the arm dragged him roughly back to the house. She was a bony, ill-tempered looking old\nwoman, and before she retired, grumbling at the child and shaking him, she favoured Cherry\nwith such an evil glance that the poor girl felt more than half inclined to turn and run right\naway.\n\n\"That's my late wife's grandmother,\" explained the widower; \"she is a cross-grained old catamaran,\nand the reason she eyed you so unpleasantly is that she knows I have brought you here to take\nher place.  Make haste and learn your work, Cherry, for I want to send the cross old dame about\nher business,\" which was hardly a respectful way in which to speak of his grandmother-in-law.\n\nHe took Cherry into the house, which was even more beautiful than the garden; brilliant light,\nlike sunshine, lighted up every room, flowers grew everywhere, mirrors and pictures lined the\nwalls, and as for the ornaments, the carpets, curtains and other beautiful things, you could\nnever believe what their beauty was unless you could see them.\n\n\"It is all so grand,\" said Cherry to herself, \"'tis too much to take in all at once.  It makes\nmy head swim, and I'd like something to eat for a change.\" She was really very, very hungry,\nfor she had had nothing to eat all day but a slice of bread and treacle.\n\nHardly had the thought come into her head, when Aunt Prudence,--as the old grandmother was\ncalled,--began to lay a table with all kinds of delicious food, to which she bade Cherry sit\ndown and eat.\n\nCherry did not require a second bidding, you may be quite sure, nor did she stop until she\nhad made a very good meal indeed.  After that she was told her duties.  She was to sleep in\nthe room with the child, and in the morning to take him and bathe him in a spring in the garden.\nAfter she had bathed him she was to anoint his eyes with some ointment she would find in a\nlittle box in a cleft in the rock.  She was to be very careful indeed to put the little box\nback where she took it from, and on no account to touch her own eyes with it.  After that was\nall done she was to milk the cow, and give the child a basin of the last milk she drew.\n\nYou can imagine how all this raised Cherry's curiosity, and how she longed to get the little\nboy to tell her about everything, but, as he always threatened to tell Aunt Prudence, directly\nshe asked him a question, she thought it better to hold her tongue, and try to find out things\nfor herself.\n\nWhen she had been told all her duties, she was conducted to her room by the old lady, who bade\nher keep her eyes shut, whether she was asleep or not, or she might wish too late that she\nhad.  She forbade her, too, to talk to the child about anything.  So Cherry was rather frightened\nby the time she got to bed, and until she fell asleep she kept her eyes and her mouth fast\nclosed, but fortunately, thanks to her tiring day and her good supper, she did not stay awake long.\n\nThe next morning as soon as she was awake she got up and began her work, but when she had bathed\nthe boy in the stream to which he led her, and had put the ointment on his eyes, she did not\nknow how to set about her next task, for there was not a cow to be seen anywhere.\n\n\"Call her,\" said the boy, when she told him her trouble.  So Cherry called, \"Coo-o, coo-o,\ncoo-o-o,\" just as she did at home, and at once a pretty sleek cow came from somewhere,--it\nmight have been out of the ground, as far as Cherry could tell.  Anyhow, there she was, and\nCherry sat down and milked her, and gave the boy his breakfast, and when she had done the cow\nwalked away again and disappeared.\n\nAfter that Cherry went indoors, where the Grandmother provided her with a big breakfast all\nto herself, after which she told her of some more of her duties.  Cherry was to keep in the\nkitchen, and clean the pots and pans with water and sand, scald the milk, make the butter,\nand do anything else she was told.  Above all she was to avoid curiosity, to keep to the kitchen,\nand never try to enter or look into a room that was locked.\n\nCherry felt that this was very hard, for, as I said before, she was full of curiosity, and\nwanted to find out all she could about these strange people she had got amongst.  She could\nscarcely endure old Aunt Prudence with her scoldings and growlings, for the old woman never\nceased grumbling at both the girl and her grandson-in-law for bringing her there."}
{"ID": 300, "text": "\nWidely as the wild story was repeated, and patiently as it was pondered,\nit was long before there was even the beginning of a sequel to it. In\nthe interval Paynter had politely removed himself from the house of\nmourning, or rather of questioning, but only so far as the village inn;\nfor Barbara Vane was glad of the traveler's experience and sympathy, in\naddition to that afforded her by the lawyer and doctor as old friends of\nthe family. Even Treherne was not discouraged from his occasional visits\nwith a view to helping the hunt for the lost man. The five held many\ncounsels round the old garden table, at which the unhappy master of\nthe house had dined for the last time; and Barbara wore her old mask of\nstone, if it was now a more tragic mask. She had shown no passion after\nthe first morning of discovery, when she had broken forth once, speaking\nstrangely enough in the view of some of her hearers.\n\nShe had come slowly out of the house, to which her own or some one\nelse's wisdom had relegated her during the night of the wager; and it\nwas clear from her face that somebody had told her the truth; Miles, the\nbutler, stood on the steps behind her; and it was probably he.\n\n\"Do not be much distressed, Miss Vane,\" said Doctor Brown, in a low and\nrather uncertain voice. \"The search in the wood has hardly begun. I am\nconvinced we shall find--something quite simple.\"\n\n\"The doctor is right,\" said Ashe, in his firm tones; \"I myself--\"\n\n\"The doctor is not right,\" said the girl, turning a white face on the\nspeaker, \"I know better. The poet is right. The poet is always right.\nOh, he has been here from the beginning of the world, and seen wonders\nand terrors that are all round our path, and only hiding behind a bush\nor a stone. You and your doctoring and your science--why, you have only\nbeen here for a few fumbling generations; and you can't conquer even\nyour own enemies of the flesh. Oh, forgive me, Doctor, I know you do\nsplendidly; but the fever comes in the village, and the people die and\ndie for all that. And now it's my poor father. God help us all! The only\nthing left is to believe in God; for we can't help believing in devils.\"\nAnd she left them, still walking quite slowly, but in such a fashion\nthat no one could go after her.\n\nThe spring had already begun to ripen into summer, and spread a green\ntent from the tree over the garden table, when the American visitor,\nsitting there with his two professional companions, broke the silence by\nsaying what had long been in his mind.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I suppose whatever we may think it wise to say, we\nhave all begun to think of a possible conclusion. It can't be put very\ndelicately anyhow; but, after all, there's a very necessary business\nside to it. What are we going to do about poor Vane's affairs, apart\nfrom himself? I suppose you know,\" he added, in a low voice to the\nlawyer, \"whether he made a will?\"\n\n\"He left everything to his daughter unconditionally,\" replied Ashe. \"But\nnothing can be done with it. There's no proof whatever that he's dead.\"\n\"No legal proof?\" remarked Paynter dryly. A wrinkle of irritation had\nappeared in the big bald brow of Doctor Brown; and he made an impatient\nmovement.\n\n\"Of course he's dead,\" he said. \"What's the sense of all this legal\nfuss? We were watching this side of the wood, weren't we? A man couldn't\nhave flown off those high cliffs over the sea; he could only have fallen\noff. What else can he be but dead?\"\n\n\"I speak as a lawyer,\" returned Ashe, raising his eyebrows. \"We can't\npresume his death, or have an inquest or anything till we find the poor\nfellow's body, or some remains that may reasonably be presumed to be his\nbody.\"\n\n\"I see,\" observed Paynter quietly. \"You speak as a lawyer; but I don't\nthink it's very hard to guess what you think as a man.\"\n\n\"I own I'd rather be a man than a lawyer,\" said the doctor, rather\nroughly. \"I'd no notion the law was such an ass. What's the good of\nkeeping the poor girl out of her property, and the estate all going\nto pieces? Well, I must be off, or my patients will be going to pieces\ntoo.\"\n\nAnd with a curt salutation he pursued his path down to the village.\n\n\"That man does his duty, if anybody does,\" remarked Paynter. \"We must\npardon his--shall I say manners or manner?\"\n\n\"Oh, I bear him no malice,\" replied Ashe good-humoredly, \"But I'm glad\nhe's gone, because--well, because I don't want him to know how jolly\nright he is.\" And he leaned back in his chair and stared up at the roof\nof green leaves.\n\n\"You are sure,\" said Paynter, looking at the table, \"that Squire Vane is\ndead?\"\n\n\"More than that,\" said Ashe, still staring at the leaves. \"I'm sure of\nhow he died.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the American, with an intake of breath, and they remained for\na moment, one gazing at the tree and the other at the table.\n\n\"Sure is perhaps too strong a word,\" continued Ashe. \"But my conviction\nwill want some shaking. I don't envy the counsel for the defense.\"\n\n\"The counsel for the defense,\" repeated Paynter, and looked up quickly\nat his companion. He was struck again by the man's Napoleonic chin and\njaw, as he had been when they first talked of the legend of St. Securis.\n\n\"Then,\" he began, \"you don't think the trees--\"\n\n\"The trees be damned!\" snorted the lawyer. \"The tree had two legs on\nthat evening. What our friend the poet,\" he added, with a sneer,\n\"would call a walking tree. Apropos of our friend the poet, you seemed\nsurprised that night to find he was not walking poetically by the sea\nall the time, and I fear I affected to share your ignorance. I was not\nso sure then as I am now.\"\n\n\"Sure of what?\" demanded the other.\n\n\"To begin with,\" said Ashe, \"I'm sure our friend the poet followed Vane\ninto the wood that night, for I saw him coming out again.\"\n\nPaynter leaned forward, suddenly pale with excitement, and struck the\nwooden table so that it rattled.\n\n\"Mr. Ashe, you're wrong,\" he cried. \"You're a wonderful man and you're\nwrong. You've probably got tons of true convincing evidence, and you're\nwrong. I know this poet; I know him as a poet; and that's just what you\ndon't. I know you think he gave you crooked answers, and seemed to be\nall smiles and black looks at once; but you don't understand the type.\nI know now why you don't understand the Irish. Sometimes you think\nit's soft, and sometimes sly, and sometimes murderous, and sometimes\nuncivilized; and all the time it's only civilized; quivering with the\nsensitive irony of understanding all that you don't understand.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Ashe shortly, \"we'll see who's right.\"\n\n\"We will,\" cried Cyprian, and rose suddenly from the table. All the\ndrooping of the aesthete had dropped from him; his Yankee accent rose\nhigh, like a horn of defiance, and there was nothing about him but the\nNew World.\n\n\"I guess I will look into this myself,\" he said, stretching his long\nlimbs like an athlete. \"I search that little wood of yours to-morrow.\nIt's a bit late, or I'd do it now.\"\n\n\"The wood has been searched,\" said the lawyer, rising also.\n\n\"Yes,\" drawled the American. \"It's been searched by servants, policemen,\nlocal policeman, and quite a lot of people; and do you know I have a\nnotion that nobody round here is likely to have searched it at all.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do with it?\" asked Ashe.\n\n\"What I bet they haven't done,\" replied Cyprian. \"I'm going to climb a\ntree.\"\n\nAnd with a quaint air of renewed cheerfulness he took himself away at a\nrapid walk to his inn.\n\nHe appeared at daybreak next morning outside the Vane Arms with all the\nair of one setting out on his travels in distant lands. He had a field\nglass slung over his shoulder, and a very large sheath knife buckled by\na belt round his waist, and carried with the cool bravado of the bowie\nknife of a cowboy. But in spite of this backwoodsman's simplicity, or\nperhaps rather because of it, he eyed with rising relish the picturesque\nplan and sky line of the antiquated village, and especially the wooden\nsquare of the old inn sign that hung over his head; a shield, of which\nthe charges seemed to him a mere medley of blue dolphins, gold crosses,\nand scarlet birds. The colors and cubic corners of that painted\nboard pleased him like a play or a puppet show. He stood staring and\nstraddling for some moments on the cobbles of the little market place;\nthen he gave a short laugh and began to mount the steep streets toward\nthe high park and garden beyond. From the high lawn, above the tree and\ntable, he could see on one side the land stretch away past the house\ninto a great rolling plain, which under the clear edges of the dawn\nseemed dotted with picturesque details. The woods here and there on\nthe plain looked like green hedgehogs, as grotesque as the incongruous\nbeasts found unaccountably walking in the blank spaces of mediaeval\nmaps. The land, cut up into colored fields, recalled the heraldry of the\nsignboard; this also was at once ancient and gay. On the other side the\nground to seaward swept down and then up again to the famous or infamous\nwood; the square of strange trees lay silently tilted on the slope, also\nsuggesting, if not a map, or least a bird's-eye view. Only the triple\ncenterpiece of the peacock trees rose clear of the sky line; and these\nstood up in tranquil sunlight as things almost classical, a triangular\ntemple of the winds. They seemed pagan in a newer and more placid\nsense; and he felt a newer and more boyish curiosity and courage for the\nconsulting of the oracle. In all his wanderings he had never walked so\nlightly, for the connoisseur of sensations had found something to do at\nlast; he was fighting for a friend.\n\nHe was brought to a standstill once, however, and that at the very\ngateway of the garden of the trees of knowledge. Just outside the black\nentry of the wood, now curtained with greener and larger leafage, he\ncame on a solitary figure.\n\nIt was Martin, the woodcutter, wading in the bracken and looking about\nhim in rather a lost fashion. The man seemed to be talking to himself.\n\n\"I dropped it here,\" he was saying. \"But I'll never work with it again I\nreckon. Doctor wouldn't let me pick it up, when I wanted to pick it up;\nand now they've got it, like they've got the Squire. Wood and iron, wood\nand iron, but eating it's nothing to them.\"\n\n\"Come!\" said Paynter kindly, remembering the man's domestic trouble.\n\"Miss Vane will see you have anything you want, I know. And look\nhere, don't brood on all those stories about the Squire. Is there the\nslightest trace of the trees having anything to do with it? Is there\neven this extra branch the idiots talked about?\"\n\nThere had been growing on Paynter the suspicion that the man before him\nwas not perfectly sane; yet he was much more startled by the sudden and\ncold sanity that looked for an instant out of the woodman's eyes, as he\nanswered in his ordinary manner.\n\n\"Well, sir, did you count the branches before?\"\n\nThen he seemed to relapse; and Paynter left him wandering and wavering\nin the undergrowth; and entered the wood like one across whose sunny\npath a shadow has fallen for an instant.\n\nDiving under the wood, he was soon threading a leafy path which, even\nunder that summer sun, shone only with an emerald twilight, as if it\nwere on the floor of the sea. It wound about more shakily than he had\nsupposed, as if resolved to approach the central trees as if they were\nthe heart of the maze at Hampton Court. They were the heart of the maze\nfor him, anyhow; he sought them as straight as a crooked road would\ncarry him; and, turning a final corner, he beheld, for the first time,\nthe foundations of those towers of vegetation he had as yet only seen\nfrom above, as they stood waist-high in the woodland. He found the\nsuspicion correct which supposed the tree branched from one great\nroot, like a candelabrum; the fork, though stained and slimy with green\nfungoids, was quite near the ground, and offered a first foothold. He\nput his foot in it, and without a flash of hesitation went aloft, like\nJack climbing the Bean stalk.\n\nAbove him the green roof of leaves and boughs seemed sealed like a\nfirmament of foliage; but, by bending and breaking the branches to\nright and left he slowly forced a passage upward; and had at last, and\nsuddenly, the sensation coming out on the top of the world. He felt\nas if he had never been in the open air before. Sea and land lay in a\ncircle below and about him, as he sat astride a branch of the tall tree;\nhe was almost surprised to see the sun still comparatively low in the\nsky; as if he were looking over a land of eternal sunrise.\n\n\"Silent upon a peak in Darien,\" he remarked, in a needlessly loud and\ncheerful voice; and though the claim, thus expressed, was illogical, it\nwas not inappropriate. He did feel as if he were a primitive adventurer\njust come to the New World, instead of a modern traveler just come from\nit.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he proceeded, \"whether I am really the first that ever burst\ninto this silent tree. It looks like it. Those--\"\n\nHe stopped and sat on his branch quite motionless, but his eyes were\nturned on a branch a little below it, and they were brilliant with a\nvigilance, like those of a man watching a snake.\n\nWhat he was looking at might, at first sight, have been a large white\nfungus spreading on the smooth and monstrous trunk; but it was not.\n\nLeaning down dangerously from his perch, he detached it from the twig on\nwhich it had caught, and then sat holding it in his hand and gazing at\nit. It was Squire Vane's white Panama hat, but there was no Squire Vane\nunder it. Paynter felt a nameless relief in the very fact that there was\nnot.\n\nThere in the clear sunlight and sea air, for an instant, all the\ntropical terrors of his own idle tale surrounded and suffocated him. It\nseemed indeed some demon tree of the swamps; a vegetable serpent that\nfed on men. Even the hideous farce in the fancy of digesting a whole man\nwith the exception of his hat, seemed only to simplify the nightmare.\nAnd he found himself gazing dully at one leaf of the tree, which\nhappened to be turned toward him, so that the odd markings, which\nhad partly made the legend, really looked a little like the eye in a\npeacock's feather. It was as if the sleeping tree had opened one eye\nupon him.\n\nWith a sharp effort he steadied himself in mind and posture on the\nbough; his reason returned, and he began to descend with the hat in his\nteeth. When he was back in the underworld of the wood, he studied the\nhat again and with closer attention. In one place in the crown there was\na hole or rent, which certainly had not been there when it had last lain\non the table under the garden tree. He sat down, lit a cigarette, and\nreflected for a long time.\n\nA wood, even a small wood, is not an easy thing to search minutely;\nbut he provided himself with some practical tests in the matter. In one\nsense the very density of the thicket was a help; he could at least see\nwhere anyone had strayed from the path, by broken and trampled growths\nof every kind. After many hours' industry, he had made a sort of new map\nof the place; and had decided beyond doubt that some person or persons\nhad so strayed, for some purpose, in several defined directions. There\nwas a way burst through the bushes, making a short cut across a loop\nof the wandering path; there was another forking out from it as an\nalternative way into the central space. But there was one especially\nwhich was unique, and which seemed to him, the more he studied it, to\npoint to some essential of the mystery.\n\nOne of these beaten and broken tracks went from the space under the\npeacock trees outward into the wood for about twenty yards and then\nstopped. Beyond that point not a twig was broken nor a leaf disturbed.\nIt had no exit, but he could not believe that it had no goal. After some\nfurther reflection, he knelt down and began to cut away grass and clay\nwith his knife, and was surprised at the ease with which they detached\nthemselves. In a few moments a whole section of the soil lifted like a\nlid; it was a round lid and presented a quaint appearance, like a flat\ncap with green feathers. For though the disc itself was made of wood,\nthere was a layer of earth on it with the live grass still growing\nthere. And the removal of the round lid revealed a round hole, black as\nnight and seemingly bottomless. Paynter understood it instantly. It was\nrather near the sea for a well to be sunk, but the traveler had known\nwells sunk even nearer. He rose to his feet with the great knife in his\nhand, a frown on his face, and his doubts resolved. He no longer shrank\nfrom naming what he knew. This was not the first corpse that had been\nthrown down a well; here, without stone or epitaph, was the grave of\nSquire Vane. In a flash all the mythological follies about saints and\npeacocks were forgotten; he was knocked on the head, as with a stone\nclub, by the human common sense of crime.\n\nCyprian Paynter stood long by the well in the wood, walked round it in\nmeditation, examined its rim and the ring of grass about it, searched\nthe surrounding soil thoroughly, came back and stood beside the well\nonce more. His researches and reflections had been so long that he had\nnot realized that the day had passed and that the wood and the world\nround it were beginning already to be steeped in the enrichment of\nevening. The day had been radiantly calm; the sea seemed to be as still\nas the well, and the well was as still as a mirror. And then, quite\nwithout warning, the mirror moved of itself like a living thing.\n\nIn the well, in the wood, the water leapt and gurgled, with a grotesque\nnoise like something swallowing, and then settled again with a second\nsound. Cyprian could not see into the well clearly, for the opening,\nfrom where he stood, was an ellipse, a mere slit, and half masked by\nthistles and rank grass like a green beard. For where he stood now was\nthree yards away from the well, and he had not yet himself realized\nthat he had sprung back all that distance from the brink when the water\nspoke.\n\n\nIII. THE MYSTERY OF THE WELL\n\nCyprian Paynter did not know what he expected to see rise out of\nthe well--the corpse of the murdered man or merely the spirit of the\nfountain. Anyhow, neither of them rose out of it, and he recognized\nafter an instant that this was, after all, perhaps the more natural\ncourse of things. Once more he pulled himself together, walked to the\nedge of the well and looked down. He saw, as before, a dim glimmer of\nwater, at that depth no brighter than ink; he fancied he still heard\na faint convulsion and murmur, but it gradually subsided to an utter\nstillness. Short of suicidally diving in, there was nothing to be\ndone. He realized that, with all his equipment, he had not even brought\nanything like a rope or basket, and at length decided to return for\nthem. As he retraced his steps to the entrance, he recurred to, and took\nstock of, his more solid discoveries. Somebody had gone into the wood,\nkilled the Squire and thrown him down the well, but he did not admit for\na moment that it was his friend the poet; but if the latter had actually\nbeen seen coming out of the wood the matter was serious. As he walked\nthe rapidly darkening twilight was cloven with red gleams, that made him\nalmost fancy for a moment that some fantastic criminal had set fire to\nthe tiny forest as he fled. A second glance showed him nothing but one\nof those red sunsets in which such serene days sometimes close.\n\nAs he came out of the gloomy gate of trees into the full glow he saw a\ndark figure standing quite still in the dim bracken, on the spot where\nhe had left the woodcutter. It was not the woodcutter.\n\nIt was topped by a tall black hat of a funeral type, and the whole\nfigure stood so black against the field of crimson fire that edged the\nsky line that he could not for an instant understand or recall it. When\nhe did, it was with an odd change in the whole channel of his thoughts.\n\n\"Doctor Brown!\" he cried. \"Why, what are you doing up here?\"\n\n\"I have been talking to poor Martin,\" answered the doctor, and made\na rather awkward movement with his hand toward the road down to the\nvillage. Following the gesture, Paynter dimly saw another dark figure\nwalking down in the blood-red distance. He also saw that the hand\nmotioning was really black, and not merely in shadow; and, coming\nnearer, found the doctor's dress was really funereal, down to the detail\nof the dark gloves. It gave the American a small but queer shock, as if\nthis were actually an undertaker come up to bury the corpse that could\nnot be found.\n\n\"Poor Martin's been looking for his chopper,\" observed Doctor Brown,\n\"but I told him I'd picked it up and kept it for him. Between ourselves,\nI hardly think he's fit to be trusted with it.\" Then, seeing the glance\nat his black garb, he added: \"I've just been to a funeral. Did you know\nthere's been another loss? Poor Jake the fisherman's wife, down in the\ncottage on the shore, you know. This infernal fever, of course.\"\n\nAs they both turned, facing the red evening light, Paynter instinctively\nmade a closer study, not merely of the doctor's clothes, but of the\ndoctor. Dr. Burton Brown was a tall, alert man, neatly dressed, who\nwould otherwise have had an almost military air but for his spectacles\nand an almost painful intellectualism in his lean brown face and bald\nbrow. The contrast was clinched by the fact that, while his face was of\nthe ascetic type generally conceived as clean-shaven, he had a strip of\ndark mustache cut too short for him to bite, and yet a mouth that often\nmoved as if trying to bite it. He might have been a very intelligent\narmy surgeon, but he had more the look of an engineer or one of those\nservices that combine a military silence with a more than military\nscience. Paynter had always respected something ruggedly reliable about\nthe man, and after a little hesitation he told him all the discoveries.\n\nThe doctor took the hat of the dead Squire in his hand, and examined it\nwith frowning care. He put one finger through the hole in the crown and\nmoved it meditatively. And Paynter realized how fanciful his own fatigue\nmust have made him; for so silly a thing as the black finger waggling\nthrough the rent in that frayed white relic unreasonably displeased him.\nThe doctor soon made the same discovery with professional acuteness,\nand applied it much further. For when Paynter began to tell him of\nthe moving water in the well he looked at him a moment through his\nspectacles, and then said:\n\n\"Did you have any lunch?\"\n\nPaynter for the first time realized that he had, as a fact, worked and\nthought furiously all day without food.\n\n\"Please don't fancy I mean you had too much lunch,\" said the medical\nman, with mournful humor. \"On the contrary, I mean you had too little.\nI think you are a bit knocked out, and your nerves exaggerate things."}

{"ID": 110, "text": "Miss Vaughan caused controversy by openly hoisting the black flag of diabolism, which the Palladist Federation strongly protested against. She was in conflict with both Lemmi and the Palladist Federation, but did not express any interest in joining the Adona\u00eftes. Despite being hostile to Lemmi, the Roman Catholic Church saw her as a potential convert to their anti-Masonic cause. However, Miss Vaughan declared that their cause was in opposition to hers and that she would not accept their support. She remained dedicated to Lucifer and aspired to be the bride of Asmodeus. \n\nEventually, the editor of Revue Mensuelle gave up on her, and she was left to be dealt with by the prayers of the faithful. One month later, M. Leo Taxil announced her conversion, and in July 1895, she began publishing her \"Memoirs of an ex Palladist,\" which are still ongoing. Unfortunately, they are not well-written and lack a chronological structure. \n\nHer memoirs provide insights into the existence of a Masonry behind Masonry, its base at Charleston with Albert Pike as its founder, and its rejection of Christianity in favor of a Luciferian cult. Miss Vaughan confirms these beliefs and reinforces Doctor Bataille's narrative through her unveiling of her private life. She appears well-versed in the terminology and intellectual bitterness of ultramontane religion, adopting it easily despite her recent conversion. Despite the limitations of her memoirs, it is clear that Miss Vaughan is an important witness to the inner workings of Palladism.In short, Miss Vaughan has fully embraced the very practices which intelligent Catholics strive to eliminate from their religion. She may not be familiar with the Forged Decretals or the corrupted versions of Epistles of St. Ignatius, but she would defend their authenticity without question if it aligned with the Church hierarchy. She follows a purblind faction within the Church that only keeps its wounds open. It is unclear what influences led to her conversion, as a change in religious beliefs usually takes time to develop. The difference between Doctor Bataille and Miss Vaughan is that she was raised to believe that she descended from a noble family within the hierarchy and was taught to follow certain Masonic practices, while Doctor Bataille came from an ordinary background. Miss Vaughan claims that her position of authority in high Masonry is due to a traditional secret about her family known only to the Elect Magi. According to her family history, her alchemist ancestor Thomas Vaughan beheaded Archbishop Laud and made a pact with Satan to receive the philosophical stone and a guaranteed life of 33 years. He wrote \"The Open Entrance\" after this pact, and the original manuscript with autograph Luciferian interpretation is a family heirloom. He also had Hermetic nuptials with goddess succubus Astarte and had an infant from their union, which he left in the care of fire-worshiping Indians.He did not pursue legal action to regain his right to be with his spouse, instead he happily gave up their supernatural child to a family of Lenni Lennaps along with a medallion portrait of himself as a way for his daughter to recognize him, following a common trope in literature. Thomas Vaughan distanced himself from his marriage by crossing the ocean and never returned to see his daughter. Despite her unique background, she did not achieve anything noteworthy in her early life. Miss Vaughan acknowledges doubts about the legend of her royal blood, even though it satisfied her and her family for generations. While the \"Memoirs of an Ex Palladist\" only goes up to the point of Thomas Vaughan's translation to Lucifer's paradise, other sources provide insight into Miss Vaughan's childhood. She was the offspring of an American Protestant from Kentucky and a French Protestant, born and educated in Paris. Her mother passed away when she was fourteen, and she presumably lived with her father near Louisville afterward. Vaughan joined the Sovereign Rite of Palladism, helped establish the Louisville Triangle 11 + 7, and initiated his daughter into the Rite of Adoption as an apprentice in 1883. Later, she achieved the ranks of Companion and Mistress too. While three issues of \"The Free and Regenerated Palladium\" were issued, they have since been withdrawn from circulation, making them challenging to obtain. The Revue Mensuelle contains autobiographical sections, detailing two apparitions by Asmodeus, levitational phenomena, arguments against the notion of hallucination, and her Templar Mistress initiation at the Paris Triangle of Saint Jacques, which involved Albert Pike sparing her from the sacrilege ordeal. Lucifer, who supposedly appears in person at the Sanctum Regnum of Charleston every Friday to instruct his chiefs, wanted to meet her, and the \"good God\" assembled his Ancients and Emerites to discuss Diana Vaughan's \"case\" on April 5th, 1889. After undergoing a triduum, she prepared for the introduction at the Sanctum Regnum. Upon arrival, Pike encouraged her, and she was welcomed by the eleven prime chiefs before being left alone with the Palladium, Baphomet. The triangular chamber lacked any sources of light, but greenish flames illuminated the walls.Miss Vaughan sat before the Baphomet, addressing Lucifer with sympathy for the unpleasant form in which he was worshipped. As she spoke, flames intensified around her, spreading to the ceiling and floor, covering her chair and clothing, and filling the room with dry heat. Thunder rolled, and five radiant spirits appeared before her. The Baphomet vanished while Lucifer manifested on a diamond throne. Despite her impulse to worship him, he gestured for her to stop. Even though Miss Vaughan had converted, she still saw Lucifer's superb masculine beauty. Their conversation was disappointingly mundane. The eleven prime chiefs returned, announcing Miss Vaughan as grand priestess of Lucifer. She was transported to take part in a grand spectacular drama with two acts. The first act included the appearance of Asmodeus, exchange of endearing expressions, manifestation of Baal Zeboub's signature, spiritualisation of Asmodeus's sweetheart, a pitched battle between genii of Lucifer and genii of Adona\u00ef, storming the Terrestrial Paradise and explanatory dialogue between Diana and her future husband. The second act was held over when she was transported to the solar world with Lucifer. She returned safely to Charleston on the back of a white eagle. Miss Vaughan claimed her experience could not have been hypnotism or hallucination. The central fact of the New and Reformed Palladium must be admitted if she is a credible witness.Dr. Bataille is a skilled hunter in the realm of Masonry and across the land of Hiram. Diana of the Palladians also holds great stature. Their revelations and confessions far surpass those of all other seceders and penitents coming out of the web of corruption. M. Jean Kostka's modest deposition will help restore order to this intoxicated universe. He tactfully reveals the unmasking of Lucifer and writes in a spirit of gratitude and reparation. Despite his exaggerations, his devotion towards Joan of Arc and St. Stanislaus Kostka are worth commending. He writes pseudonymously, but it is not to deceive. Jules Doinel, a Masonic orator and poet, is identified as our witness. M. Papus speaks well of him, despite his betrayals and scandalous actions, describing his choice between renouncing the path of transcendence or falling into madness."}

{"ID": 1559, "text": "On the other hand, the lover is contained in the\nbeloved, inasmuch as the lover penetrates, so to speak, into the\nbeloved. For nothing hinders a thing from being both container and\ncontents in different ways: just as a genus is contained in its\nspecies, and vice versa.\n\nReply Obj. 2: The apprehension of the reason precedes the movement of\nlove. Consequently, just as the reason divides, so does the movement\nof love penetrate into the beloved, as was explained above.\n\nReply Obj. 3: This argument is true of the third kind of mutual\nindwelling, which is not to be found in every kind of love.\n________________________\n\nTHIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 28, Art. 3]\n\nWhether Ecstasy Is an Effect of Love?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that ecstasy is not an effect of love.\nFor ecstasy seems to imply loss of reason. But love does not always\nresult in loss of reason: for lovers are masters of themselves at\ntimes. Therefore love does not cause ecstasy.\n\nObj. 2: Further, the lover desires the beloved to be united to him.\nTherefore he draws the beloved to himself, rather than betakes\nhimself into the beloved, going forth out from himself as it were.\n\nObj. 3: Further, love unites the beloved to the lover, as stated\nabove (A. 1). If, therefore, the lover goes out from himself, in\norder to betake himself into the beloved, it follows that the lover\nalways loves the beloved more than himself: which is evidently false.\nTherefore ecstasy is not an effect of love.\n\n_On the contrary,_ Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that \"the Divine\nlove produces ecstasy,\" and that \"God Himself suffered ecstasy\nthrough love.\" Since therefore according to the same author (Div.\nNom. iv), every love is a participated likeness of the Divine Love,\nit seems that every love causes ecstasy.\n\n_I answer that,_ To suffer ecstasy means to be placed outside\noneself. This happens as to the apprehensive power and as to the\nappetitive power. As to the apprehensive power, a man is said to be\nplaced outside himself, when he is placed outside the knowledge\nproper to him. This may be due to his being raised to a higher\nknowledge; thus, a man is said to suffer ecstasy, inasmuch as he is\nplaced outside the connatural apprehension of his sense and reason,\nwhen he is raised up so as to comprehend things that surpass sense\nand reason: or it may be due to his being cast down into a state of\ndebasement; thus a man may be said to suffer ecstasy, when he is\novercome by violent passion or madness. As to the appetitive power, a\nman is said to suffer ecstasy, when that power is borne towards\nsomething else, so that it goes forth out from itself, as it were.\n\nThe first of these ecstasies is caused by love dispositively in so\nfar, namely, as love makes the lover dwell on the beloved, as stated\nabove (A. 2), and to dwell intently on one thing draws the mind from\nother things. The second ecstasy is caused by love directly; by love\nof friendship, simply; by love of concupiscence not simply but in a\nrestricted sense. Because in love of concupiscence, the lover is\ncarried out of himself, in a certain sense; in so far, namely, as not\nbeing satisfied with enjoying the good that he has, he seeks to enjoy\nsomething outside himself. But since he seeks to have this extrinsic\ngood for himself, he does not go out from himself simply, and this\nmovement remains finally within him. On the other hand, in the love\nof friendship, a man's affection goes out from itself simply; because\nhe wishes and does good to his friend, by caring and providing for\nhim, for his sake.\n\nReply Obj. 1: This argument is true of the first kind of ecstasy.\n\nReply Obj. 2: This argument applies to love of concupiscence, which,\nas stated above, does not cause ecstasy simply.\n\nReply Obj. 3: He who loves, goes out from himself, in so far as he\nwills the good of his friend and works for it. Yet he does not will\nthe good of his friend more than his own good: and so it does not\nfollow that he loves another more than himself.\n________________________\n\nFOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 28, Art. 4]\n\nWhether Zeal Is an Effect of Love?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that zeal is not an effect of love. For\nzeal is a beginning of contention; wherefore it is written (1 Cor.\n3:3): \"Whereas there is among you zeal [Douay: 'envying'] and\ncontention,\" etc. But contention is incompatible with love. Therefore\nzeal is not an effect of love.\n\nObj. 2: Further, the object of love is the good, which communicates\nitself to others. But zeal is opposed to communication; since it\nseems an effect of zeal, that a man refuses to share the object of\nhis love with another: thus husbands are said to be jealous of\n(_zelare_) their wives, because they will not share them with others.\nTherefore zeal is not an effect of love.\n\nObj. 3: Further, there is no zeal without hatred, as neither is there\nwithout love: for it is written (Ps. 72:3): \"I had a zeal on occasion\nof the wicked.\" Therefore it should not be set down as an effect of\nlove any more than of hatred.\n\n_On the contrary,_ Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): \"God is said to be\na zealot, on account of his great love for all things.\"\n\n_I answer that,_ Zeal, whatever way we take it, arises from the\nintensity of love. For it is evident that the more intensely a power\ntends to anything, the more vigorously it withstands opposition or\nresistance. Since therefore love is \"a movement towards the object\nloved,\" as Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 35), an intense love seeks to\nremove everything that opposes it.\n\nBut this happens in different ways according to love of\nconcupiscence, and love of friendship. For in love of concupiscence\nhe who desires something intensely, is moved against all that hinders\nhis gaining or quietly enjoying the object of his love. It is thus\nthat husbands are said to be jealous of their wives, lest association\nwith others prove a hindrance to their exclusive individual rights.\nIn like manner those who seek to excel, are moved against those who\nseem to excel, as though these were a hindrance to their excelling.\nAnd this is the zeal of envy, of which it is written (Ps. 36:1): \"Be\nnot emulous of evil doers, nor envy (_zelaveris_) them that work\niniquity.\"\n\nOn the other hand, love of friendship seeks the friend's good:\nwherefore, when it is intense, it causes a man to be moved against\neverything that opposes the friend's good. In this respect, a man is\nsaid to be zealous on behalf of his friend, when he makes a point of\nrepelling whatever may be said or done against the friend's good. In\nthis way, too, a man is said to be zealous on God's behalf, when he\nendeavors, to the best of his means, to repel whatever is contrary to\nthe honor or will of God; according to 3 Kings 19:14: \"With zeal I\nhave been zealous for the Lord of hosts.\" Again on the words of John\n2:17: \"The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up,\" a gloss says that \"a\nman is eaten up with a good zeal, who strives to remedy whatever evil\nhe perceives; and if he cannot, bears with it and laments it.\"\n\nReply Obj. 1: The Apostle is speaking in this passage of the zeal of\nenvy; which is indeed the cause of contention, not against the object\nof love, but for it, and against that which is opposed to it.\n\nReply Obj. 2: Good is loved inasmuch as it can be communicated to the\nlover. Consequently whatever hinders the perfection of this\ncommunication, becomes hateful. Thus zeal arises from love of good.\nBut through defect of goodness, it happens that certain small goods\ncannot, in their entirety, be possessed by many at the same time: and\nfrom the love of such things arises the zeal of envy. But it does not\narise, properly speaking, in the case of those things which, in their\nentirety, can be possessed by many: for no one envies another the\nknowledge of truth, which can be known entirely by many; except\nperhaps one may envy another his superiority in the knowledge of it.\n\nReply Obj. 3: The very fact that a man hates whatever is opposed to\nthe object of his love, is the effect of love. Hence zeal is set down\nas an effect of love rather than of hatred.\n________________________\n\nFIFTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 28, Art. 5]\n\nWhether Love Is a Passion That Wounds the Lover?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that love wounds the lover. For languor\ndenotes a hurt in the one that languishes. But love causes languor:\nfor it is written (Cant 2:5): \"Stay me up with flowers, compass me\nabout with apples; because I languish with love.\" Therefore love is\na wounding passion.\n\nObj. 2: Further, melting is a kind of dissolution. But love melts\nthat in which it is: for it is written (Cant 5:6): \"My soul melted\nwhen my beloved spoke.\" Therefore love is a dissolvent: therefore it\nis a corruptive and a wounding passion.\n\nObj. 3: Further, fervor denotes a certain excess of heat; which\nexcess has a corruptive effect. But love causes fervor: for Dionysius\n(Coel. Hier. vii) in reckoning the properties belonging to the\nSeraphim's love, includes \"hot\" and \"piercing\" and \"most fervent.\"\nMoreover it is said of love (Cant 8:6) that \"its lamps are fire and\nflames.\" Therefore love is a wounding and corruptive passion.\n\n_On the contrary,_ Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that \"everything\nloves itself with a love that holds it together,\" i.e. that preserves\nit. Therefore love is not a wounding passion, but rather one that\npreserves and perfects.\n\n_I answer that,_ As stated above (Q. 26, AA. 1, 2; Q. 27, A. 1), love\ndenotes a certain adapting of the appetitive power to some good. Now\nnothing is hurt by being adapted to that which is suitable to it;\nrather, if possible, it is perfected and bettered. But if a thing be\nadapted to that which is not suitable to it, it is hurt and made\nworse thereby. Consequently love of a suitable good perfects and\nbetters the lover; but love of a good which is unsuitable to the\nlover, wounds and worsens him. Wherefore man is perfected and\nbettered chiefly by the love of God: but is wounded and worsened by\nthe love of sin, according to Osee 9:10: \"They became abominable, as\nthose things which they loved.\"\n\nAnd let this be understood as applying to love in respect of its\nformal element, i.e. in regard to the appetite. But in respect of the\nmaterial element in the passion of love, i.e. a certain bodily\nchange, it happens that love is hurtful, by reason of this change\nbeing excessive: just as it happens in the senses, and in every act\nof a power of the soul that is exercised through the change of some\nbodily organ.\n\nIn reply to the objections, it is to be observed that four proximate\neffects may be ascribed to love: viz. melting, enjoyment, languor,\nand fervor. Of these the first is \"melting,\" which is opposed to\nfreezing. For things that are frozen, are closely bound together, so\nas to be hard to pierce. But it belongs to love that the appetite is\nfitted to receive the good which is loved, inasmuch as the object\nloved is in the lover, as stated above (A. 2). Consequently the\nfreezing or hardening of the heart is a disposition incompatible with\nlove: while melting denotes a softening of the heart, whereby the\nheart shows itself to be ready for the entrance of the beloved. If,\nthen, the beloved is present and possessed, pleasure or enjoyment\nensues. But if the beloved be absent, two passions arise; viz.\nsadness at its absence, which is denoted by \"languor\" (hence Cicero\nin _De Tusc. Quaest._ iii, 11 applies the term \"ailment\" chiefly to\nsadness); and an intense desire to possess the beloved, which is\nsignified by \"fervor.\" And these are the effects of love considered\nformally, according to the relation of the appetitive power to its\nobject. But in the passion of love, other effects ensue,\nproportionate to the above, in respect of a change in the organ.\n________________________\n\nSIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 28, Art. 6]\n\nWhether Love Is Cause of All That the Lover Does?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that the lover does not do everything from\nlove. For love is a passion, as stated above (Q. 26, A. 2). But man\ndoes not do everything from passion: but some things he does from\nchoice, and some things from ignorance, as stated in _Ethic._ v, 8.\nTherefore not everything that a man does, is done from love.\n\nObj. 2: Further, the appetite is a principle of movement and action\nin all animals, as stated in _De Anima_ iii, 10. If, therefore,\nwhatever a man does is done from love, the other passions of the\nappetitive faculty are superfluous.\n\nObj. 3: Further, nothing is produced at one and the same time by\ncontrary causes. But some things are done from hatred. Therefore all\nthings are not done from love.\n\n_On the contrary,_ Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that \"all things,\nwhatever they do, they do for the love of good.\"\n\n_I answer that,_ Every agent acts for an end, as stated above (Q. 1,\nA. 2). Now the end is the good desired and loved by each one.\nWherefore it is evident that every agent, whatever it be, does every\naction from love of some kind.\n\nReply Obj. 1: This objection takes love as a passion existing in the\nsensitive appetite. But here we are speaking of love in a general\nsense, inasmuch as it includes intellectual, rational, animal, and\nnatural love: for it is in this sense that Dionysius speaks of love\nin chapter iv of _De Divinis Nominibus._\n\nReply Obj. 2: As stated above (A. 5; Q. 27, A. 4) desire, sadness and\npleasure, and consequently all the other passions of the soul, result\nfrom love. Wherefore every act that proceeds from any passion,\nproceeds also from love as from a first cause: and so the other\npassions, which are proximate causes, are not superfluous.\n\nReply Obj. 3: Hatred also is a result of love, as we shall state\nfurther on (Q. 29, A. 2).\n________________________\n\nQUESTION 29\n\nOF HATRED\n(In Six Articles)\n\nWe must now consider hatred: concerning which there are six points of\ninquiry:\n\n(1) Whether evil is the cause and the object of hatred?\n\n(2) Whether love is the cause of hatred?\n\n(3) Whether hatred is stronger than love?\n\n(4) Whether a man can hate himself?\n\n(5) Whether a man can hate the truth?\n\n(6) Whether a thing can be the object of universal hatred?\n________________________\n\nFIRST ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 29, Art. 1]\n\nWhether Evil Is the Cause and Object of Hatred?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that evil is not the object and cause of\nhatred. For everything that exists, as such, is good. If therefore\nevil be the object of hatred, it follows that nothing but the lack\nof something can be the object of hatred: which is clearly untrue.\n\nObj. 2: Further, hatred of evil is praiseworthy; hence (2 Macc. 3:1)\nsome are praised for that \"the laws were very well kept, because of\nthe godliness of Onias the high-priest, and the hatred of their souls\n[Douay: 'his soul'] had no evil.\" If, therefore, nothing but evil be\nthe object of hatred, it would follow that all hatred is commendable:\nand this is clearly false.\n\nObj. 3: Further, the same thing is not at the same time both good and\nevil. But the same thing is lovable and hateful to different\nsubjects. Therefore hatred is not only of evil, but also of good.\n\n_On the contrary,_ Hatred is the opposite of love. But the object of\nlove is good, as stated above (Q. 26, A. 1; Q. 27, A. 1). Therefore\nthe object of hatred is evil.\n\n_I answer that,_ Since the natural appetite is the result of\napprehension (though this apprehension is not in the same subject as\nthe natural appetite), it seems that what applies to the inclination\nof the natural appetite, applies also to the animal appetite, which\ndoes result from an apprehension in the same subject, as stated above\n(Q. 26, A. 1). Now, with regard to the natural appetite, it is\nevident, that just as each thing is naturally attuned and adapted to\nthat which is suitable to it, wherein consists natural love; so has\nit a natural dissonance from that which opposes and destroys it; and\nthis is natural hatred. So, therefore, in the animal appetite, or in\nthe intellectual appetite, love is a certain harmony of the appetite\nwith that which is apprehended as suitable; while hatred is\ndissonance of the appetite from that which is apprehended as\nrepugnant and hurtful. Now, just as whatever is suitable, as such,\nbears the aspect of good; so whatever is repugnant, as such, bears\nthe aspect of evil. And therefore, just as good is the object of\nlove, so evil is the object of hatred.\n\nReply Obj. 1: Being, as such, has not the aspect of repugnance but\nonly of fittingness; because being is common to all things. But\nbeing, inasmuch as it is this determinate being, has an aspect of\nrepugnance to some determinate being. And in this way, one being is\nhateful to another, and is evil; though not in itself, but by\ncomparison with something else.\n\nReply Obj. 2: Just as a thing may be apprehended as good, when it is\nnot truly good; so a thing may be apprehended as evil, whereas it is\nnot truly evil. Hence it happens sometimes that neither hatred of\nevil nor love of good is good.\n\nReply Obj. 3: To different things the same thing may be lovable or\nhateful: in respect of the natural appetite, owing to one and the\nsame thing being naturally suitable to one thing, and naturally\nunsuitable to another: thus heat is becoming to fire and unbecoming\nto water: and in respect of the animal appetite, owing to one and\nthe same thing being apprehended by one as good, by another as bad.\n________________________\n\nSECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 29, Art. 2]\n\nWhether Love Is a Cause of Hatred?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that love is not a cause of hatred. For\n\"the opposite members of a division are naturally simultaneous\"\n(Praedic. x). But love and hatred are opposite members of a division,\nsince they are contrary to one another. Therefore they are naturally\nsimultaneous. Therefore love is not the cause of hatred.\n\nObj. 2: Further, of two contraries, one is not the cause of the\nother. But love and hatred are contraries. Therefore love is not the\ncause of hatred.\n\nObj. 3: Further, that which follows is not the cause of that which\nprecedes. But hatred precedes love, seemingly: since hatred implies a\nturning away from evil, whereas love implies a turning towards good.\nTherefore love is not the cause of hatred.\n\n_On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7, 9) that all\nemotions are caused by love. Therefore hatred also, since it is an\nemotion of the soul, is caused by love.\n\n_I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 1), love consists in a certain\nagreement of the lover with the object loved, while hatred consists\nin a certain disagreement or dissonance. Now we should consider in\neach thing, what agrees with it, before that which disagrees: since a\nthing disagrees with another, through destroying or hindering that\nwhich agrees with it. Consequently love must needs precede hatred;\nand nothing is hated, save through being contrary to a suitable thing\nwhich is loved. And hence it is that every hatred is caused by love.\n\nReply Obj. 1: The opposite members of a division are sometimes\nnaturally simultaneous, both really and logically; e.g. two species\nof animal, or two species of color. Sometimes they are simultaneous\nlogically, while, in reality, one precedes, and causes the other;\ne.g. the species of numbers, figures and movements. Sometimes they\nare not simultaneous either really or logically; e.g. substance and\naccident; for substance is in reality the cause of accident; and\nbeing is predicated of substance before it is predicated of accident,\nby a priority of reason, because it is not predicated of accident\nexcept inasmuch as the latter is in substance. Now love and hatred\nare naturally simultaneous, logically but not really. Wherefore\nnothing hinders love from being the cause of hatred.\n\nReply Obj. 2: Love and hatred are contraries if considered in respect\nof the same thing. But if taken in respect of contraries, they are\nnot themselves contrary, but consequent to one another: for it\namounts to the same that one love a certain thing, or that one hate\nits contrary. Thus love of one thing is the cause of one's hating its\ncontrary.\n\nReply Obj. 3: In the order of execution, the turning away from one\nterm precedes the turning towards the other. But the reverse is the\ncase in the order of intention: since approach to one term is the\nreason for turning away from the other. Now the appetitive movement\nbelongs rather to the order of intention than to that of execution.\nWherefore love precedes hatred: because each is an appetitive\nmovement.\n________________________\n\nTHIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 29, Art. 3]\n\nWhether Hatred Is Stronger Than Love?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that hatred is stronger than love. For\nAugustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 36): \"There is no one who does not flee\nfrom pain, more than he desires pleasure.\" But flight from pain\npertains to hatred; while desire for pleasure belongs to love.\nTherefore hatred is stronger than love.\n\nObj. 2: Further, the weaker is overcome by the stronger. But love is\novercome by hatred: when, that is to say, love is turned into hatred.\nTherefore hatred is stronger than love.\n\nObj. 3: Further, the emotions of the soul are shown by their effects.\nBut man insists more on repelling what is hateful, than on seeking\nwhat is pleasant: thus also irrational animals refrain from pleasure\nfor fear of the whip, as Augustine instances (QQ. 83, qu. 36).\nTherefore hatred is stronger than love.\n\n_On the contrary,_ Good is stronger than evil; because \"evil does\nnothing except in virtue of good,\" as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv).\nBut hatred and love differ according to the difference of good and\nevil. Therefore love is stronger than hatred.\n\n_I answer that,_ It is impossible for an effect to be stronger than\nits cause. Now every hatred arises from some love as its cause, as\nabove stated (A. 2). Therefore it is impossible for hatred to be\nstronger than love absolutely.\n\nBut furthermore, love must needs be, absolutely speaking, stronger\nthan hatred. Because a thing is moved to the end more strongly than\nto the means. Now turning away from evil is directed as a means to\nthe gaining of good. Wherefore, absolutely speaking, the soul's\nmovement in respect of good is stronger than its movement in respect\nof evil.\n\nNevertheless hatred sometimes seems to be stronger than love, for two\nreasons. First, because hatred is more keenly felt than love. For,\nsince the sensitive perception is accompanied by a certain\nimpression; when once the impression has been received it is not felt\nso keenly as in the moment of receiving it. Hence the heat of a\nhectic fever, though greater, is nevertheless not felt so much as the\nheat of tertian fever; because the heat of the hectic fever is\nhabitual and like a second nature. For this reason, love is felt more\nkeenly in the absence of the object loved; thus Augustine says (De\nTrin. x, 12) that \"love is felt more keenly when we lack what we\nlove.\" And for the same reason, the unbecomingness of that which is\nhated is felt more keenly than the becomingness of that which is\nloved. Secondly, because comparison is made between a hatred and a\nlove which are not mutually corresponding. Because, according to\ndifferent degrees of good there are different degrees of love to\nwhich correspond different degrees of hatred. Wherefore a hatred that\ncorresponds to a greater love, moves us more than a lesser love.\n\nHence it is clear how to reply to the First Objection. For the love\nof pleasure is less than the love of self-preservation, to which\ncorresponds flight from pain. Wherefore we flee from pain more than\nwe love pleasure.\n\nReply Obj. 2: Hatred would never overcome love, were it not for the\ngreater love to which that hatred corresponds. Thus man loves\nhimself, more than he loves his friend: and because he loves himself,\nhis friend is hateful to him, if he oppose him.\n\nReply Obj. 3: The reason why we act with greater insistence in\nrepelling what is hateful, is because we feel hatred more keenly.\n________________________\n\nFOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 29, Art. 4]\n\nWhether a Man Can Hate Himself?\n\nObjection 1: It would seem that a man can hate himself. For it is\nwritten (Ps. 10:6): \"He that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.\"\nBut many love iniquity. Therefore many hate themselves.\n\nObj. 2: Further, him we hate, to whom we wish and work evil. But\nsometimes a man wishes and works evil to himself, e.g. a man who\nkills himself. Therefore some men hate themselves.\n\nObj. 3: Further, Boethius says (De Consol. ii) that \"avarice makes a\nman hateful\"; whence we may conclude that everyone hates a miser. But\nsome men are misers. Therefore they hate themselves.\n\n_On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (Eph. 5:29) that \"no man ever\nhated his own flesh.\"\n\n_I answer that,_ Properly speaking, it is impossible for a man to\nhate himself. For everything naturally desires good, nor can anyone\ndesire anything for himself, save under the aspect of good: for \"evil\nis outside the scope of the will,\" as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv).\nNow to love a man is to will good to him, as stated above (Q. 26, A.\n4). Consequently, a man must, of necessity, love himself; and it is\nimpossible for a man to hate himself, properly speaking.\n\nBut accidentally it happens that a man hates himself: and this in two\nways. First, on the part of the good which a man wills to himself.\nFor it happens sometimes that what is desired as good in some\nparticular respect, is simply evil; and in this way, a man\naccidentally wills evil to himself; and thus hates himself. Secondly,\nin regard to himself, to whom he wills good. For each thing is that\nwhich is predominant in it; wherefore the state is said to do what\nthe king does, as if the king were the whole state. Now it is clear\nthat man is principally the mind of man. And it happens that some men\naccount themselves as being principally that which they are in their\nmaterial and sensitive nature. Wherefore they love themselves\naccording to what they take themselves to be, while they hate that\nwhich they really are, by desiring what is contrary to reason. And in\nboth these ways, \"he that loveth iniquity hateth\" not only \"his own\nsoul,\" but also himself.\n\nWherefore the reply to the First Objection is evident.\n\nReply Obj. 2: No man wills and works evil to himself, except he\napprehend it under the aspect of good. For even they who kill\nthemselves, apprehend death itself as a good, considered as putting\nan end to some unhappiness or pain."}

Plain thou now appear'st\n  That Evil One, Satan for ever damned.\"\n    To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:--\n  \"Be not so sore offended, Son of God--\n  Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men--\n  If I, to try whether in higher sort\n  Than these thou bear'st that title, have proposed\n  What both from Men and Angels I receive,                    200\n  Tetrarchs of Fire, Air, Flood, and on the Earth\n  Nations besides from all the quartered winds--\n  God of this World invoked, and World beneath.\n  Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold\n  To me most fatal, me it most concerns.\n  The trial hath indamaged thee no way,\n  Rather more honour left and more esteem;\n  Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed.\n  Therefore let pass, as they are transitory,\n  The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more                 210\n  Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not.\n  And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined\n  Than to a worldly crown, addicted more\n  To contemplation and profound dispute;\n  As by that early action may be judged,\n  When, slipping from thy mother's eye, thou went'st\n  Alone into the Temple, there wast found\n  Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant\n  On points and questions fitting Moses' chair,\n  Teaching, not taught.

Within the walls then view          250\n  The schools of ancient sages--his who bred\n  Great Alexander to subdue the world,\n  Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next.\n  There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power\n  Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit\n  By voice or hand, and various-measured verse,\n  AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,\n  And his who gave them breath, but higher sung,\n  Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called,\n  Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own.                  260\n  Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught\n  In chorus or iambic, teachers best\n  Of moral prudence, with delight received\n  In brief sententious precepts, while they treat\n  Of fate, and chance, and change in human life,\n  High actions and high passions best describing.\n  Thence to the famous Orators repair,\n  Those ancient whose resistless eloquence\n  Wielded at will that fierce democraty,\n  Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece                 270\n  To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne.\n  To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear,\n  From heaven descended to the low-roofed house\n  Of Socrates--see there his tenement--\n  Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced\n  Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth\n  Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools\n  Of Academics old and new, with those\n  Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect\n  Epicurean, and the Stoic severe.                            280\n  These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home,\n  Till time mature thee to a kingdom's weight;\n  These rules will render thee a king complete\n  Within thyself, much more with empire joined.\"\n    To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:--\n  \"Think not but that I know these things; or, think\n  I know them not, not therefore am I short\n  Of knowing what I ought.

Yet I did not despair, and\nkept on burning my incense at her feet. She liked my society because she used to shew me the\nletters she wrote, and I was very careful to admire her style. She had her own portrait in\nminiature, which was an excellent likeness. The day before my departure, vexed at having lost\nmy time and my amorous compliments, I made up my mind to steal that portrait--a slight compensation\nfor not having won the original.

Their garments were tattered, their shoes\nwere in sad disrepair. They had walked (they said) all the way from Jerusalem. Might they find\nshelter for the night? The tale they told, and the mere sight of their trembling old beards,\nwould have melted hearts far harder than those which beat in the breasts of the monks of Oyster-le-Main.\nBut above all, these pilgrims brought with them as convincing proofs of their journey a collection\nof relics and talismans (such as are to be met with only in Eastern countries) of great wonder\nand virtue. With singular generosity, which they explained had been taught them by the Arabs,\nthey presented many of these treasures to the delighted inmates of the Monastery, who hastened\nto their respective cells,--this one reverently cherishing a tuft of hair from the tail of\none of Daniel's lions; another handling with deep fervour a strip of the coat of many colours\nonce worn by the excellent Joseph. But the most extraordinary relic among them all was the\nskin of a huge lizard beast, the like of which none in England had ever seen. This, the Pilgrims\ntold their hosts, was no less a thing than a crocodile from the Nile, the renowned river of\nMoses. It had been pressed upon them, as they were departing from the City of Damascus, by\na friend, a blameless chiropodist, whose name was Omar Khayyam. He it was who eked out a pious\ngroat by tending the feet of all outward and inward bound pilgrims.

Wide as a temple's arch, or a king's\ngateway, bedded in gravel, Covered with grassy turf, arched to the top, the tomb rose forbidding.\nLight issued from it. Through a small crevice within the closed portal, Peered the two champions.\nThere the pitched viking ship Stood with its masts, its yards and its anchor. High in the stern\nsheets Was seated a terrible figure, clad in a mantle all flaming, Furious demon scouring a\nblade that with blood spots was covered. Vain was his labor, naught could remove them. All\nhis rich booty Round him was scattered, and on his arm was the ring he had stolen.\n\n\"Go we,\" said Bele, \"down thither and fight with the hideous goblin, Two 'gainst a spirit of\nfire.\" But Thorstein half angrily answered: \"One against one is the rule of our fathers. I\nfight well singly.\" Long they contended which first of the two the encounter should venture,\nProving the perilous journey. Bele at last took his helmet, Shaking two lots therein. Watched\nby the stars Thorstein saw by their shimmer His was the lot first appearing. A blow from his\njavelin of iron Cleft the huge bolts and strong locks. He descended. Did any one question What\nwas revealed in the cavern, then was he silent and shuddered. Bele at first heard strange music.\nIt rang like the song of a goblin; Then was a clattering noise, like the clashing of blades\nin a combat, Lastly a hideous shriek,--then silence. Out staggered Thorstein, Confounded, bewildered,\nall pale was his face, for with death had he battled; Yet bore he the arm-ring a trophy. \"'Twas\ndear bought,\" he often said frowning; \"Once in my life was I frightened; 'twas when I recovered\nthat arm-ring.\" Widely renowned was that ring, and of rings was the chief in the Northland.\n\nLastly the ship, called Ellide, was one of the family jewels. Viking, so say they, returning\ntriumphant from venturesome journeys, Sailed along coasting near Framness. There he espied\non a shipwreck, Carelessly swinging, a sailor, sporting as 'twere with the billows. Noble of\nfigure, tall in his stature, joyful his visage, Changeable too, like the waves of the sea when\nthey sport ill the sunshine,-- Blue was his mantle, golden his girdle and studded with corals;\nSea-green his hair, but his beard was as white as the foam of the ocean. Viking his serpent\nsteered thither to rescue the unfortunate stranger,-- Took him half frozen to Framness, and\nthere as a guest entertained him. When by his host to repose he was bidden, smiling he answered:\n\"Fair sits the wind, and my ship which you boarded, is not yet disabled; Long ere the morning\nI trust she will hear me a hundred miles seaward. Thanks for thy bidding, 'twas well meant\nand kindly. Ah! could I only Leave thee a gift to remind thee of me! but afar on the ocean\nLieth my kingdom. Perhaps in the morning 'twill waft thee a token.\" Viking next day by the\nsea-shore was standing, when lo! like an eagle Madly pursuing its prey, a dragon ship sailed\ninto harbor. Nowhere was visible sailor or captain, or even a steersman; Winding 'mid rocks\nand through breakers, the rudder a path sought unaided; When the firm strand it was nearing,\nsudden, as ruled by a spirit, Reefed were the sails unassisted. Untouched by finger of mortal,\nThe anchor sped through the clear water and fastened its barbs in the bottom. Viking gazed,\nspeechless with wonder; the sportive winds sang in low cadence: \"AEger the rescued forgetteth\nno kindness, he gives thee the dragon.\" Kingly the gift to behold. The heavy curved planks\nof oak timber Matched not together like others, but grew in one broad piece united. It stretched\nits huge form in the sea like a dragon, its stem proudly lifted, A stately head high in the\nair. Its throat with red gold was all blazing; Sprinkled its belly with yellow and azure, and\nback of the rudder, Covered with scales of pure silver, its tail lashed the waves in a circle.\nBordered with red were its inky black pinions. When all unfolding, It flew in a race with the\nwhirlwind, and left far behind the swift eagle. When it was filled with armed warriors, you'd\nfancy you were beholding A citadel swimming the billows, or palace o'er ocean ave flying. Widely\nrenowned was that ship, and of ships was the chief in the Northland.\n\nAll this and other vast treasures did Fridthjof receive from his father. Scarce was there found\nin the Northland any with richer possessions, Save were he heir of a kingdom, for of kings\nis the wealth always greatest. Though from no king he descended, yet was his mind truly royal,\nCourteous, noble and kind. Daily became he more famous. Twelve gray-haired champions, valorous\nchieftains, sat at his table, Thorstein's steel-breasted companions, whose brows were with\nscars deeply furrowed. Next to the warriors was seated a youth of the same age as Fridthjof,--\n\nLike a fresh rose 'mid the dry leaves of autumn; Bjorn was this blossom. Grown up with Fridthjof,\nin days of their boyhood their blood they commingled, Brothers becoming in good northern fashion,\nsworn to each other In joy and in grief, the survivor avenging the death of his comrade.\n\nIn the midst of the warriors and guests who had come to the funeral banquet, Fridthjof, a sorrowing\nhost, his eyelids with tears overflowing Drank in accordance with ancestral usage, a skoal\nto his father, Heard the old minstrels sing loudly his praises, a thundering drapa, Rightfully\ntook of his late father's seat undisputed possession, And sat between Odin and Frey. So sitteth\nThor up in Valhal.\n\nIV.\n\nFridthjof's Courtship.\n\nLoud sounded the music in Fridthjof's hall, His ancestors' praises sang poets all. O'erwhelmed\nwith sadness Is Fridthjof, he hears not their songs of gladness.\n\nThe earth has again donned her mantle of green And dragon-ships breasting the waves are seen\nBut Fridthjof, pondering, Is at the moon gazing or in the woods wandering.\n\nHow fortunate was he but lately, and glad, For Helge and Halfdan as guests he had; And with\nthe brothers, Came Ingeborg; Fridthjof scarce saw the others.\n\nHe sat by her side and her soft hand he pressed; He felt in the pressure returned him thrice\nblest, Enraptured gazing On her whom he honored beyond all praising.\n\nIn glad conversation recalling their plays, When life's morning dew presaged bright future\ndays For memory truthful Keeps life's rosy gardens in noble minds youthful.\n\nHow fondly she greets him from dale and from park, From loving names growing in White birchen\nbark, From hills where flourish The oaks which the ashes of heroes nourish.\n\n\"'Tis never so pleasant at home as here, For Halfdan is childish and Helge severe; Tho kings\nattending To nothing but prayers and praise unending.\n\n\"And no one (nor could she her blushes hide) To whom my complainings I may confide. The palace\nbuilding, How stifling compared with the groves of Hilding.\n\n\"The doves that we petted, and tamed and fed,\n\nBy hawks oft affrighted away have fled; One pair remaineth, Let Fridthjof take one, one Ing'borg\nretaineth.\n\n\"She'll long like another her friend to see,-- And homeward returning will fly to me: Your\nmessage, bind it Beneath her flee pinion,--there none will find it.\"\n\nAll day they sat whispering side by side, Nor ceased the low murmur at eventide; So breathe\nin whispers The zephyrs through lindens at twilight vespers.\n\nBut now she has gone, and his joy forsooth Has gone with the maiden. The blood of youth His\ncheek is mounting, He silently sighs while the past recounting.\n\nHis grief at her absence he sent by the dove, Which joyous set out with its message of love;\nBut oh! new sorrow, It stayed with its mate, nor returned on the morrow.\n\nHis conduct to Bjorn was displeasing; said he: \"What ails our young eagle, he seems to be Like\nsome shy sparrow,-- Has his breast or his pinion been pierced by an arrow?\n\n\"What wilt thou, Fridthjof? We have for need The yellow bacon, and the good, brown mead; And\npoets singing, Their jubilant music forever ringing.\n\n\"The steeds impatiently stamp in the stalls,-- To the chase! to the chase! the falcon calls;\nBut Fridthjof retaineth His gloom. He hunteth in clouds and complaineth.\n\n\"Ellide is restless upon the main,-- She frets and she chafes at her cable chain; Lie still\nmy treasure! Our Fridthjof is peaceable. Strife is no pleasure.\n\n\"Who dies on his pallet,, is dead indeed; By the lance, as did Odin, we'll die, if need,--\nAnd thus ensure us A welcome to Hel, and heaven secure us.\"\n\nThen Fridthjof unloos'd the dragon,--and proud, With full swelling canvas, the waves she plowed,\nAnd swiftly over The bay to the palace she bore the lover.\n\nThe kings were at Bele's grave met that day,-- To administer justice and counsel weigh; Fridthjof\nadvances,-- His voice sounds afar like clashing lances.\n\n\"Ye kings, lovely Ing'borg, the people's pride, I choose, from all women, to be my bride; The\nking intended Our lives thus united in one should be blended.\n\n\"He reared us together in Hilding's sight,-- As two forest saplings whose tops unite,-- A golden\ncover Of lace bindeth Freyja the green tops over.\n\n\"My sire was a peasant, no earl nor king,-- Yet his memory will live while the poets sing;\nIn runic story The grave-mounds are telling my ancestors' glory.\n\n\"I could easily win me a crown and land, But choose to remain on my native strand: In battle\nwielding My sword for the king, and the peasant shielding.\n\n\"On king Bele's grave we are standing now, He hears every word in the grave below, With me\nhe pleadeth,-- A dead father's counsel a wise son heedeth.\"\n\nThen Helge uprose, and replied with scorn, \"Our sister was not for a peasant born, To kings\n'tis given To strive for our Ingeborg, daughter of heaven.\n\n\"You boastfully call yourself chief of swords,-- Win men by violence, women bv words; Boast\nnot of slaughter, For arrogance winneth not Odin's daughter.\n\n\"My kingdom doth not seek protection from thee, I shield it myself. My man wouldst thou be,--\nA situation Among my domestics befits thy station.\"\n\n\"Thy servant! no, never!\" was Fridthjof's reply, \"My father had never a master--shall I? From\nthy silver dwelling Now fly, Angervadil, the insult repelling.\"\n\nIn sunshine now glitters the blue steel blade,-- Displaying its letters in flaming red. \"My\ngood sword loyal, Thy lineage at least,\" said Fridthjof, \"is royal.\n\n\"And were it not now for the high grave's renown, Right here would I hew thee, swarthy king,\ndown: Yet will I teach thee To come not again where my sword can reach thee.\"\n\nSo saying, be severed at one fell blow The gold shield of Helge which hung on a bough. It fell\nasunder,-- Its clang on the grave-mound was echoed under.\n\n\"Well done, Angervadil. lie still and dream Of high achievements,-- meanwhile the gleam Of\nrune-fires paling! And now we'll go home o'er the blue waters sailing.\"\n\nV.\n\nKing Ring.\n\nKing Ring moved his gold-stool back. Then uprose\n Champion and dreamer;--\nFor where in the North does such goodness repose?\nHis word o'erflows\n With the wisdom which dwells in god Mimer.\n\nLike the groves of the peaceful gods was his land,--\n War's sable pinion\nCast not a shadow where on every hand\nFlowers expand\nThrough the length of his quiet dominion.\n\nHere Justice alone on the judgment-seat\n With Right presided;\nAnd Peace every year paid its tribute meet,--\nWhile golden wheat\n With plenty the harvest provided.\n\nAnd swarthy-prowed ships to this favored shore,\n With snowy pinions\nThe products of numberless nations bore,--\nA varied store\n Of riches for fortune's rich minions.\n\nHere freedom and peace did in concord dwell,\n Kindly united;\nAnd all loved their father, the king, full well,\nFor each might tell\n His mind in the thing,* none were slighted.\n\n*See glossary.\n\nSupreme in the Northland through thirty years\n His reign extended;\nContented each went to his daily cares;\nAt evening prayers\n The king's name in blessings ascended.\n\nKing Ring moved his gold-stool back. From the board\n All there assembled\nArose to attend on the royal word,--\nRenowned where heard:\n But he sighed, and in accents that trembled,\n\nHe said: \"My lost queen is in Folkvang-hall\n On purple seated;\nBut here on her grave is a grassy pall,\nWhile breathe o'er all\n The flowers with sweet odor freighted.\n\n\"So queenly, so honored, so good and so fair,\n There's not another.\nImmortal she dwelleth in Valhal's care,\nBut the people's prayer,\n The children's desire, is a mother.\n\n\"King Bele oft sat as a guest at my side\n When winter ended;\nThe daughter he left I would choose for my bride,--\nHer father's pride,\n In whose cheeks rose and lily are blended.\n\n\"I know she is young, and in youth sublime.\n Would gather flowers;\nMy flower is past and my early prime;\nMy locks has Time\n Besprinkled with snowy showers.\n\nOh, could she but honor the withered tree\n Which age has blighted;\nAnd could she a friend to the motherless be,\nThen should you see\n To the throne Spring by Autumn invited.\n\n\"Take gold froth my coffers, take jewels rare,\n Unstinted measure\nLet minstrels attending the way prepare\nTo win the fair,--\n For song heralds wooing and pleasure.\"\n\nWith gold and petitions, a noisy throng,\n The young men speeded;\nAnd minstrels and skalds, in procession long,\nWith hero-song\n To the sons of King Bele proceeded.\n\nThe feast, where with wassail they drink and sing,\n For three days lasted,\nBut they sought the fourth morning what answer they'd bring\nFrom Helge king,--\n For now their return must be hasted.\n\nIn the grove Helge offered both bird and beast,--\n A sacred duty;\nAsked counsel of vala, consulted the priest\nWhat answer was best\n For the queen of affection and beauty.\n\nThe offerings and vala and priest denied\n The wished-for token;\nAnd Helge, affrighted by signs he'd tried,\nWith \"No,\" replied,\n For men must obey when the gods have spoken.\n\nBut merry king Halfdan laughed gayly, and said,\n \"The feast is ended,\nKing Gray-beard himself should have come instead,\nI'd glad have led\n His beast, and his mounting attended.\"\n\nIndignant the embassy went away,\n Nor longer tarried;\n\"King Graybeard his honor'll avenge one day,\"\nIs Ring heard to say,\n When to him the curt message is carried.\n\nHe strikes his bright shield hanging high on a bough,--\n His weapon seizes;\nAnd many a dragon is hurrying now,\nWith blood-red prow,\n And helmet plumes wave in the breezes.\n\nThe tidings flew swiftly to Helge king,\n Who answered slowly:\n\"The strife will be bloody, for mighty is Ring;\nMy sister bring\n To the temple of Balder, the holy.\"\n\nThere sitteth the loving one, full of woes,\n Though safe abiding:\nShe weeps, while with silk and with god she sews\nA tear overflows,--\n The dew 'mid the lilies is hiding.\n\nVI.\n\nFridthjof Plays Chess\n\nBjorn and Fridthjof chess were playing\nOn a board, whose squares displaying\n Gold and silver deftly fitted,\n  Skill and beauty both combined.\nThen stepped Hilding in. \"Come nigher,\"\nFridthjof said, \"and sit thee higher\n 'Till our game shall be completed,--\n  Foster-father kind.\"\n\nHilding answered: \"From the palace\nI am come to you for solace.\n Evil are the times at present,\n  You are all the people's hope.\"\nFridthjof said: \"The foe encroaches,\nDanger, Bjorn, your king approaches;\n You can save him by a peasant.--\n  He is nothing, give him up.\n\n\"Fridthjof, anger kings no longer,\nLo, the eagle's young grow stronger;\n Ring may thwart, their weak endeavor,\n  Thou wilt surely find it hard.\"\n\"Bjorn, I see you storm the tower.\nAnd in vain your threatening power\n 'Gainst the castle is; it ever\n  Safety seeks behind its guard.\"\n\n\"Ing'borg sits in Balder's dwelling,\nGrief her constant tears compelling:\n She should make thee seize thy armor\n  She with tearful eyes of blue.\"\n\"Vain you strive my queen to capture,\nDear from childhood's days of rapture;\n Best of all, there's nought shall harm her\n  Come what may, to her I'm true.\"\n\n\"Fridthjof, art thou still unheeding\nAll thy foster-father's pleading?\n For thy foolish game art ready\n  I should go without a word?\"\nFridthjof then arises, laying\nHilding's hand in his, and saying:\n \"My resolve is firm and steady,\n  And my answer you have heard.\n\n\"Go to Bele's sons and warn them,\nPeasants love not those who scorn them;\n To their power I bid defiance,\n  Their behests will not obey.\"\n\"In thy chosen way abide thee,\nFor thy wrath I can not chide thee;\n Odin must be our reliance,\"\n  Hilding said, and went his way.\n\nVII.\n\nFridthjof's Happiness.\n\nKing Bele's sons may go requesting\n From dale to dale the peasants' aid,\nIn Balder's grove my world is resting,\n For them I will not draw my blade.\nThen on king's vengeance or earth's sadness,\n I will no longer look or think,\nBut only will the high gods' gladness,\n From out one cup with Ing'borg drink.\n\nWhile yet the hazy sunshine sendeth\n Its purple rays on flowers at rest,\nLike rosy gossamer which lendeth\n An added charm to Ing'borg's breast,\nWith sighs along the strand I wander,\n My soul with longing all aflame,\nUpon the sand I gaze and ponder\n And with my sword write Ing'borg's name.\n\nHow slowly go the lonesome hours!\n Thou Delling's son, why stayest thou?\nHast thou not seen our mountain bowers,\n Our lakes and islands until now?\nDwells there in western halls no maiden\n Who waits since morn first kissed the sea,\nUpon thy breast her joys to unladen,\n Whose whole of life is love and thee?\n\nAt last thy footsteps grow uncertain,\n Thy weary journey thou must close,\nNow evening draws the rosy curtain,\n Behind whose folds the gods repose.\nThe brooks and breezes to each other\n In softest whispers love express;\nO! welcome Night, of gods the mother,\n With pearls upon thy wedding dress.\n\nThe stars are gliding like a lover\n On tiptoe to a maiden true;\nEllide! fly the deep gulf over,\n Roll on, roll on, ye billows blue.\nYon sacred grove a temple hideth,\n Good Balder's temple, doubly dear,\nFor there love's goddess safe abideth,\n Unto the gods our course we steer.\n\nThy shores I tread with joyous measure,\n I kiss thy brown cheek, smiling earth,\nAnd all ye little flowers, with treasure\n Of white and red, that edge my path.\nI hail thee, moon, with pale light streaming\n On temple-grove and flowers at rest,\nHow beautiful thou sittest dreaming\n Like Saga at a wedding feast.\n\nTo speak with flowers, O, brook, who taught thee\n The feeling in my heart a guest?\nYe northern nightingales, where caught ye\n The wailing stolen from my breast?\nWith evening's red the fairies playing,\n In clouds my Ing'borg's form disclose,\nBut Freyja, jealousy displaying.\n Away the image quickly blows.\n\nThough changing clouds lose her resemblance,\n Like radiant hope herself appears,\nAs true as childhood's sweet remembrance,\n She comes, my love's reward she bears.\nCome, loved one, come, and let me press thee\n Unto the heart that holds thee dear,\nMy soul's desire, through life, I'll bless thee,\n Come to my arms, and rest thee here.\n\nFrail as the lily's stem so slender,\n Yet like spring roses fresh and fair,\nAs Freyja's troth-plight, warm and tender,\n Thou as the will of gods art pure.\nKiss me, and let my burning passion\n Kindle thy soul to perfect bliss,\nOf earth and heaven I lose the vision,\n Enraptured by thy melting kiss.\n\nFear not, for here can come no stranger,\n Without stands Bjorn. his sword in hand,\nHis champions guarding ns from danger,\n If need be, can the world withstand;\nAnd I, if fighting for my treasure,\n Whose form I on my bosom bear,\nTo Valhal now would go with pleasure,\n Could'st then be my valkyrie there.\n\nAnd why fear Balder's fierce resentment,\n The pious god to whom we pray?\nHe looks on us with calm contentment,\n For, loving, we his law obey.\nThe god whose brow with sunshine beameth,\n With whom all truth abideth sure,\nHis love unto his Nanna seemeth\n Like mine to thee, so warm, so pure.\n\nThere stands his image, not indignant,\n But mild and soft as sunset ray,\nUpon this shrine of god benignant,\n My heart a sacrifice I lay.\nTogether let us kneel before him,\n No better offering can be found\nThan two fond hearts which both adore him,\n With love like his together bound.\n\nScorn not my love, my blossom cherished,\n Which more to heaven than earth belongs,\nIn heaven itself that love was nourished,\n And for that glorious home it longs.\nOh! that my weary soul releasing,\n The gods would take me up above;\nTriumphantly, with joy unceasing,\nI'd go, embraced by my dear love.\n\nWhen bugle-notes the champions rally,\n From out the silver gates they ride;\nBut I alone join not the sally,\n I linger gladly by thy side.\nWhen Valhal's maidens pass me, smiling,\n The mead-horn with its rim of gold;\nThee, only thee, my love beguiling,\n My tender, loving arms enfold.\n\nA leafy cottage near the meadow\n I'd build us by the dark-blue sea,\nAnd there we'd rest us 'neath the shadow\n Of many a golden-fruited tree;\nAnd when bright Valhal's sun each morning,\n With his clear torch in splendor rose,--\nWe'd hasten to the gods returning,\n Yet longing for our home's repose.\n\nThy golden locks, with sunshine flushing,\n Wreathed with a starry crown should be;\nSo my pale lily, rosy blushing,\n In Vingolf-hall should dance with me.\nThen, by my love from danger guarded,\n I'd with thee to our home repair,--\nWhere singeth Brage, silver-bearded,\n Our wedding song each evening fair.\n\nHow sweet the evening song-bird's vesper!\n It cometh forth from Valhal's shore;\nHow soft the moon-beams' gentle whisper,\n From where the dead live evermore!\nThey tell of light and love unbroken,\n In homes devoid of care and pain;\nWhere joyous words alone are spoken,\n There thou my love shalt ever reign.\n\nOh, weep not, love, those tears regretful,\n While through my heart the life-blood streams;\nBut sweetly sleep,--of grief forgetful\n May love and Fridthjof fill thy dreams.\nOh! when thine arms thou foldest round me,\n When thy dear eyes but look on me,\nHow quickly breaks the spell that bound me,\n How turn my thoughts from heaven to thee!\n\n\"List to the lark's melodious numbers.\"\n Nay, 'tis a dove his love-song sings,\nThe lark on yonder hillock slumbers,\n Beside his mate with folded wings."}

{"ID": 869, "text": "Young as they were, traces of the working of the curse which\nhad blighted their lives, were plainly visible in both. Both were equally pale and thoughtful,\nboth robbed of the brightness and gayety belonging to their years, only varying in expression\nas they varied in temperament. The look of meek and patient endurance on the face of the younger\nspoke of a nature that wrong and suffering might crush, but could never rouse to anger or resentment--of\na heart that would break, if must be, but would patiently lie down and die. The scornful defiance\nflashing ever and anon in the face of the elder brother, the immeasurable bitterness mingling\nwith its sadness, showed a proud and fiery temperament that could be goaded to desperation.\n\n'But she shall never strike me many times more,' continued Charley, with suppressed indignation.\nAfter a pause, during which, with compressed lip and clouded brow, he had been resentfully\ndwelling upon the pain and humiliation consequent upon the blows he had received: 'Never! never!\nfor I don't care if it _is_ wrong, if pa _does_ tell me not to do it, I don't care if she is\nmy mother; after I get just a little bigger, when she strikes me, I'm going to strike back again.'\n\nThese vengeful threats exciting no answering comments from his brother, Charley turned to look\nat him. A strange prophetic chill swept across the intuitional soul, and filled it with vague,\nshuddering apprehension.\n\n'Harry, don't look that way; Harry, come back to yourself! Oh, Harry! take your eyes from the\nsky and look at me. You frighten me so!' cried Charley, in a voice tremulous with agitation.\n\nThe consciousness of his surroundings had dawned so slowly on the rapt soul, the patient face\nhad turned toward his brother's so calmly, he was so meek and quiet, so undemonstrative usually,\nthat he was totally unprepared for the wild burst of passionate weeping with which Harry threw\nhimself upon his neck.\n\n'Oh! Charley, Charley, I cannot find it, I cannot see the land you talk of. I know it must\nbe there, where the sky is clear and the sun is shining; but I've been looking, and I can't\nsee it anywhere. Oh! Charley, where is it? Where is the place up yonder where they are good\nand happy? Show me the way there, show me the way.

{"ID": 1421, "text": "\nFar from being alarmed at this formidable demonstration of force, England prepared for her\nresistance with an energy becoming her ancient rank in Europe, and far surpassing in its efforts\nany extent of military preparation before heard of in her history. To nearly one hundred thousand\ntroops of the line, were added eighty thousand and upwards of militia, which scarce yielded\nto the regulars in point of discipline. The volunteer force, by which every citizen was permitted\nand invited to add his efforts to the defence of the country, was far more numerous than during\nthe last war, was better officered also, and rendered every way more effective. It was computed\nto amount to three hundred and fifty thousand men, who, if we regard the shortness of the time\nand the nature of the service, had attained considerable practice in the use and management\nof their arms. Other classes of men were embodied, and destined to act as pioneers, drivers\nof wagons, and in the like services. On a sudden, the land seemed converted to an immense camp,\nthe whole nation into soldiers, and the good old king himself into a general-in-chief. All\npeaceful considerations appeared for a time to be thrown aside; and the voice, calling the\nnation to defend their dearest rights, sounded not only in Parliament, and in meetings convoked\nto second the measures of defence, but was heard in the places of public amusement, and mingled\neven with the voice of devotion--not unbecoming surely, since to defend our country is to defend\nour religion.\n\nBeacons were erected in conspicuous points, corresponding with each other, all around and all\nthrough the island; and morning and evening, one might have said, every eye was turned towards\nthem to watch for the fatal and momentous signal. Partial alarms were given to different places,\nfrom the mistakes to which such arrangements must necessarily be liable; and the ready spirit\nwhich animated every species of troops where such signals called to arms, was of the most satisfactory\ndescription, and afforded the most perfect assurance, that the heart of every man was in the\ncause of his country.\n\nAmidst her preparations by land, England did not neglect or relax her precautions on the element\nshe calls her own. She covered the ocean with five hundred and seventy ships of war of various\ndescriptions. Divisions of her fleet blocked up every French port in the channel; and the army\ndestined to invade our shores, might see the British flag flying in every direction on the\nhorizon, waiting for their issuing from the harbour, as birds of prey may be seen floating\nin the air above the animal which they design to pounce upon. Sometimes the British frigates\nand sloops of war stood in, and cannonaded or threw shells into Havre, Dieppe, Granville, and\nBoulogne itself. Sometimes the seamen and marines landed, cut out vessels, destroyed signal\nposts, and dismantled batteries. Such events were trifling, and it was to be regretted that\nthey cost the lives of gallant men; but although they produced no direct results of consequence,\nyet they had their use in encouraging the spirits of our sailors, and damping the confidence\nof the enemy, who must at length have looked forward with more doubt than hope to the invasion\nof the English coast, when the utmost vigilance could not prevent their experiencing insults\nupon their own.\n\nDuring this period of menaced attack and arranged defence, Bonaparte visited Boulogne, and\nseemed active in preparing his soldiers for the grand effort. He reviewed them in an unusual\nmanner, teaching them to execute several manoeuvres by night; and experiments were also made\nupon the best mode of arranging the soldiers in the flat-bottomed boats, and of embarking and\ndisembarking them with celerity. Omens were resorted to for keeping up the enthusiasm which\nthe presence of the First Consul naturally inspired. A Roman battle-axe was said to be found\nwhen they removed the earth to pitch Bonaparte's tent or barrack; and medals of William the\nConqueror were produced, as having been dug up upon the same honoured spot. These were pleasant\nbodings, yet perhaps did not altogether, in the minds of the soldiers, counterbalance the sense\nof insecurity impressed on them by the prospect of being packed together in these miserable\nchaloupes, and exposed to the fire of an enemy so superior at sea, that during the chief consul's\nreview of the fortifications, their frigates stood in shore with composure, and fired at him\nand his suite as at a mark. The men who had braved the perils of the Alps and of the Egyptian\ndeserts, might yet be allowed to feel alarm at a species of danger which seemed so inevitable,\nand which they had no adequate means of repelling by force of arms.\n\nA circumstance which seemed to render the expedition in a great measure hopeless, was the ease\nwith which the English could maintain a constant watch upon their operations within the port\nof Boulogne. The least appearance of stir or preparation, to embark troops, or get ready for\nsea, was promptly sent by signal to the English coast, and the numerous British cruisers were\ninstantly on the alert to attend their motions. Nelson had, in fact, during the last war, declared\nthe sailing of a hostile armament from Boulogne to be a most forlorn undertaking, on account\nof cross tides and other disadvantages, together with the certainty of the flotilla being lost\nif there were the least wind west-north-west. \"As for rowing,\" he adds, \"that is impossible.--It\nis perfectly right to be prepared for a mad government,\" continued this incontestable judge\nof maritime possibilities; \"but with the active force which has been given me, I may pronounce\nit almost impracticable.\"\n\nBefore quitting the subject, we may notice, that Bonaparte seems not to have entertained the\nleast doubts of success, could he have succeeded in disembarking his army. A single general\naction was to decide the fate of England. Five days were to bring Napoleon to London, where\nhe was to perform the part of William the Third; but with more generosity and disinterestedness.\nHe was to call a meeting of the inhabitants, restore them what he calls their rights, and destroy\nthe oligarchical faction. A few months would not, according to his account, have elapsed, ere\nthe two nations, late such determined enemies, would have been identified by their principles,\ntheir maxims, their interests. The full explanation of this gibberish, (for it can be termed\nno better, even proceeding from the lips of Napoleon,) is to be found elsewhere, when he spoke\na language more genuine than that of the _Moniteur_ and the bulletins. \"England,\" he said,\n\"must have ended, by becoming an appendage to the France of _my_ system. Nature has made it\none of our islands, as well as Oleron and Corsica.\"\n\nIt is impossible not to pursue the train of reflections which Bonaparte continued to pour forth\nto the companion of his exile, on the rock of Saint Helena. When England was conquered, and\nidentified with France in maxims and principles, according to one form of expression, or rendered\nan appendage and dependency, according to another phrase, the reader may suppose that Bonaparte\nwould have considered his mission as accomplished. Alas! it was not much more than commenced.\n\"I would have departed from thence [from subjugated Britain] to carry the work of European\nregeneration [that is, the extention of his own arbitrary authority] from south to north, under\nthe Republican colours, for I was then Chief Consul, in the same manner which I was more lately\non the point of achieving it under the monarchical forms.\" When we find such ideas retaining\nhold of Napoleon's imagination, and arising to his tongue after his irretrievable fall, it\nis impossible to avoid exclaiming, Did ambition ever conceive so wild a dream, and had so wild\na vision ever a termination so disastrous and humiliating!\n\nIt may be expected that something should be here said, upon the chances which Britain would\nhave had of defending herself successfully against the army of invaders. We are willing to\nacknowledge that the risk must have been dreadful; and that Bonaparte, with his genius and\nhis army, must have inflicted severe calamities upon a country which had so long enjoyed the\nblessings of peace. But the people were unanimous in their purpose of defence, and their forces\ncomposed of materials to which Bonaparte did more justice when he came to be better acquainted\nwith them. Of the three British nations, the English have since shown themselves possessed\nof the same steady valour which won the fields of Cressy and Agincourt, Blenheim and Minden--the\nIrish have not lost the fiery enthusiasm which has distinguished them in all the countries\nof Europe--nor have the Scots degenerated from the stubborn courage with which their ancestors\nfor two thousand years maintained their independence against a superior enemy. Even if London\nhad been lost, we would not, under so great a calamity, have despaired of the freedom of the\ncountry; for the war would in all probability have assumed that popular and national character\nwhich sooner or later wears out an invading army. Neither does the confidence with which Bonaparte\naffirms the conviction of his winning the first battle, appear go certainly well founded. This,\nat least, we know, that the resolution of the country was fully bent up to the hazard; and\nthose who remember the period will bear us witness, that the desire that the French would make\nthe attempt, was a general feeling through all classes, because they had every reason to hope\nthat the issue might be such as for ever to silence the threat of invasion.\n\nThe next most important occurrence that claims our notice in this volume, and which fully delineates\nthe nature and character of this wonderful and ambitious individual, is the account of his\ndeclaration as Emperor of France, and his subsequent Coronation.\n\nCORONATION OF NAPOLEON.\n\nMeasures were taken, as on former occasions, to preserve appearances, by obtaining, in show\nat least, the opinion of the people, on this radical change of their system. Government, however,\nwere already confident of their approbation, which, indeed, had never been refused to any of\nthe various constitutions, however inconsistent, that had succeeded each other with such rapidity.\nSecure on this point, Bonaparte's accession to the empire was proclaimed with the greatest\npomp, without waiting to inquire whether the people approved of his promotion or otherwise.\nThe proclamation was coldly received, even by the populace, and excited little enthusiasm.\nIt seemed, according to some writers, as if the shades of D'Enghien and Pichegru had been present\ninvisibly, and spread a damp over the ceremony. The Emperor was recognised by the soldiery\nwith more warmth. He visited the encampments at Boulogne, with the intention, apparently, of\nreceiving such an acknowledgment from the troops as was paid by the ancient Franks to their\nmonarchs, when they elevated them on their bucklers. Seated on an iron chair, said to have\nbelonged to king Dagobert, he took his place between two immense camps, and having before him\nthe Channel and the hostile coasts of England. The weather, we have been assured, had been\ntempestuous, but no sooner had the Emperor assumed his seat, to receive the homage of his shouting\nhost, than the sky cleared, and the wind dropt, retaining just breath sufficient gently to\nwave the banners. Even the elements seemed to acknowledge the imperial dignity, all save the\nsea, which rolled as carelessly to the feet of Napoleon as it had formerly done towards those\nof Canute the Dane.\n\nThe Emperor, accompanied with his Empress, who bore her honours both gracefully and meekly,\nvisited Aix-la-Chapelle, and the frontiers of Germany. They received the congratulations of\nall the powers of Europe, excepting England, Russia, and Sweden, upon their new exaltation;\nand the German princes, who had everything to hope and fear from so powerful a neighbour, hastened\nto pay their compliments to Napoleon in person, which more distant sovereigns offered by their\nambassadors.\n\nBut the most splendid and public recognition of his new rank was yet to be made, by the formal\nact of coronation, which, therefore, Napoleon determined should take place with circumstances\nof solemnity, which had been beyond the reach of any temporal prince, however powerful, for\nmany ages. His policy was often marked by a wish to revive, imitate, and connect his own titles\nand interest with, some ancient observance of former days; as if the novelty of his claims\ncould have been rendered more venerable by investing them with antiquated forms, or as men\nof low birth, when raised to wealth and rank, are sometimes desirous to conceal the obscurity\nof their origin under the blaze of heraldic honours. Pope Leo, he remembered, had placed a\ngolden crown on the head of Charlemagne, and proclaimed him Emperor of the Romans. Pius VII.\nhe determined should do the same for a successor to much more than the actual power of Charlemagne.\nBut though Charlemagne had repaired to Rome to receive inauguration from the hands of the Pontiff\nof that day, Napoleon resolved that he who now owned the proud, and in Protestant eyes profane,\ntitle of Vicar of Christ, should travel to France to perform the coronation of the successful\nchief, by whom the See of Rome had been more than once humbled, pillaged, and impoverished,\nbut by whom also her power had been re-erected and restored, not only in Italy, but in France\nitself.\n\nHumiliating as the compliance with Bonaparte's request must have seemed to the more devoted\nCatholics, Pius VII. had already sacrificed, to obtain the Concordat, so much of the power\nand privileges of the Roman See, that he could hardly have been justified if he had run the\nrisk of losing the advantages of a treaty so dearly purchased, by declining to incur some personal\ntrouble, or, it might be termed, some direct self-abasement. The Pope, and the Cardinals whom\nhe consulted, implored the illumination of heaven upon their councils; but it was the stern\nvoice of necessity which assured them, that, except at the risk of dividing the Church by a\nschism, they could not refuse to comply with Bonaparte's requisition. The Pope left Rome on\nthe 5th of November. He was everywhere received on the road with the highest respect, and most\nprofound veneration; the Alpine precipices themselves had been secured by parapets wherever\nthey could expose the venerable Father of the Catholic Church to danger, or even apprehension.\nUpon the 25th of November, he met Bonaparte at Fontainbleau; and the conduct of the Emperor\nNapoleon was as studiously respectful towards him, as that of Charlemagne, whom he was pleased\nto call his predecessor, could have been towards Leo.\n\nOn the 2nd of December, the ceremony of the coronation took place in the ancient cathedral\nof Notre Dame, with the addition of every ceremony which could be devised to add to its solemnity.\nYet we have been told that the multitude did not participate in the ceremonial with that eagerness\nwhich characterises the inhabitants of all capitals, but especially those of Paris, upon similar\noccasions. They had, within a very few years, seen so many exhibitions, processions, and festivals,\nestablished on the most discordant principles, which, though announced as permanent and unchangeable,\nhad successively given way to newer doctrines, that they considered the splendid representation\nbefore them as an unsubstantial pageant, which would fade away in its turn. Bonaparte himself\nseemed absent and gloomy, till recalled to a sense of his grandeur by the voice of the numerous\ndeputies and functionaries sent up from all the several departments of France, to witness the\ncoronation. These functionaries had been selected with due attention to their political opinions;\nand many of them holding offices under the government, or expecting benefits from the Emperor,\nmade up, by the zealous vivacity of their acclamations, for the coldness of the good citizens\nof Paris.\n\nThe Emperor took his coronation oath, as usual on such occasions, with his hands up on the\nscripture, and in the form in which it was repeated to him by the Pope. But in the act of coronation\nitself, there was a marked deviation from the universal custom, characteristic of the man,\nthe age, and the conjuncture. In all other similar solemnities, the crown had been placed on\nthe sovereign's head by the presiding spiritual person, as representing the Deity, by whom\nprinces rule. But not even from the head of the Catholic Church would Bonaparte consent to\nreceive as a boon the golden symbol of sovereignty, which he was sensible he owed solely to\nhis own unparalleled train of military and civil successes. The crown having been blessed by\nthe Pope, Napoleon took it from the altar with his own hands, and placed it on his brows. He\nthen put the diadem on the head of his Empress, as if determined to show that his authority\nwas the child of his own actions. _Te Deum_ was sung; the heralds, (for they also had again\ncome into fashion,) proclaimed, \"that the thrice glorious and thrice august Napoleon, Emperor\nof the French, was crowned and installed.\" Thus concluded this remarkable ceremony. Those who\nremember having beheld it, must now doubt whether they were waking, or whether fancy had framed\na vision so dazzling in its appearance, so extraordinary in its origin and progress, and so\nephemeral in its endurance.\n\nThe very day before the ceremony of coronation, (that is, on the 1st of December,) the senate\nhad waited upon the Emperor with the result of the votes collected in the departments, which,\ntill that time, had been taken for granted. Upwards of three millions five hundred thousand\ncitizens had given their votes on this occasion; of whom only about three thousand five hundred\nhad declared against the proposition. The vice-president, Neufchateau, declared, \"this report\nwas the unbiassed expression of the people's choice. No government could plead a title more\nauthentic.\"\n\nSir Walter occupies his sixth volume with details of the celebrated battles that were fought\nbetween the French and English armies in the Spanish territories, and which are told with great\ntruth and develope the extraordinary powers of this celebrated writer."}
